        "content": "As the world emerges from COP 29 in a cloud of uncertainty, what is certain is the need for more renewable energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global renewable capacity to grow by 2.7 times by 2030, but it’s still not enough.\nOceans provide an unlimited source of clean energy, sourced from changes in salinity, thermal gradients, tidal currents and ocean waves. Ocean power currently makes up the smallest share of the renewable energy market but its potential is huge, and investment is growing as governments and industry recognize the value of this largely untapped source.\nIEC Technical Committee 114 develops international standards for marine energy to support the industry’s safe and sustainable growth. This includes the IEC 62600 series that covers requirements and guidance for wave, tidal and other water current converters. Part 100 Electricity producing wave energy converters - Power performance assessment was recently updated to ensure it still meets market needs.\nA wave energy converter is a device which generates electricity using the action of water waves and delivers electricity to an electrical load. As the industry moves from research to commercial production, it is necessary to be able to validate the performance in a standardized way across the world for greater market acceptance.\nThe standard is also useful for attracting investment as, when used in conjunction with conformity assessment such as certification, it can provide an objective and globally accepted measure of its performance.\nThe IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications (IECRE) runs conformity assessment programmes for the marine energy industry, including standards such as the IEC 6200 series.\nJonathan Colby, Chair of TC 114 and Convenor of the Marine Energy Sector Working Group (ME-SWG) within the IECRE System:\n\"IEC TS 62600-100 is an important tool for the marine energy industry as it provides an internationally recognized method for estimation of the power performance of electricity producing wave energy converters. This second edition builds upon and improves the first edition to ensure it remains relevant for the marine energy industry. The updates also enable it to be integrated into the IECRE System immediately to support third-party verification of compliance within a global certification system.\"\nThe standard is designed to be applied in conjunction with the IEC Technical Specification on wave energy resource assessment and characterization (IEC TS 62600-101), the updated version of which is to be published soon."

        "content": "Overhead power lines are some of the first to bear the brunt during extreme weather events, and with climate change making them more frequent, the lines need to be ever more resilient. As world leaders gather at COP 29 this week to negotiate new climate targets, IEC standards experts are continually working on solutions to challenges such as this to keep the world safely connected.\nThe last decade was the warmest on record and extreme weather events are continuing to cause huge economic and human losses, according to the World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate 2024 Update issued at COP 29 this week\nIncreasing the safety, reliability and performance of overhead power lines is, therefore, essential to continue bringing electricity to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Doing so safely and effectively is what this year’s IEC Lord Kelvin Award winner Elias Ghannoum has spent more than 50 years of his life working on. Extreme climate events are no longer a rarity, he says, so electricity lines need to be more climate proof than ever before.\n“We are moving to a world where lines that were designed for extreme weather that might cause a line failure once every 50 years are being redesigned to withstand the types of failures we used to expect to see once every 500 years,” he said. \nA recognized world expert and leader in overhead line design and overhead conductors, Mr. Ghannoum is known as the “father of IEC 60826”, the international standard for design criteria of overhead transmission lines. His long-term contribution to global electrotechnical standardization is what earned him the award, which is the highest reward for electrotechnical expertise in the IEC.\nMr. Ghannoum was instrumental in the worldwide shift in design criteria for overhead lines to a more robust method known as ‘reliability-based design’, helping to make power lines better equipped to withstand unexpected events and reduce the occurrence of power failures. It also provides requirements on how to mitigate the consequences should the lines fail.\nIn order for the lines to be resilient against extreme weather, the weather needs to be identified and quantified.\n“Extreme winds, ice accretion (freezing rain, wet snow) on conductors and structures and any other weather event that is more than the current strength of existing lines needs to be measured so that we can either increase line strength to cope with the weather loads or to build additional lines.”\nHe said the challenge we have now is that building new lines is not always an option, so increasing the reliability of existing lines is essential. The design requirements in IEC 60826 such as reliability and security to prevent cascading failures address that challenge.\n“It’s about knowing your weather and knowing your lines. You need to understand possible weather variations and the probability of dangerous events occurring, as well as the components of the line and what elements are likely to fail first.”\nDuring his long career, Mr. Ghannoum has provided engineering services for more than 60 transmission system operators and utilities including those in Canada, France, Greece, India, South Africa, the USA, and Brazil. His involvement in standards development spans more than 45 years.\nHe was presented with the 2024 Lord Kelvin award at the IEC General Meeting in Edinburgh by IEC president Jo Cops and was congratulated by Her Highness, Royal Princess, who gave a speech during the event.

        "content": "The Japanese National Committee (JPNC) of the IEC is taking proactive steps to prepare for the full implementation of Online Standards Development (OSD) platform in 2025. They have developed a Japanese-language starter kit to guide users through the platform's features and functionalities to prepare a high level of participation of their national experts.\nAtsuko Saruhashi, a member of the IEC Board/Task Force 5, told me that the initiative reflected a commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and maximizing the benefits of the OSD platform. \"We recognized the need for comprehensive, localized training materials to facilitate understanding, enhance user experience and empower a wider range of participants to actively contribute to the standardization process\", she said.\nThe OSD platform gives TC experts access to web-based tools for drafting and editing designed specifically with international standards in mind. These digital tools help to streamline the standards development process as well as facilitate collaborative work by allowing standards developers to work simultaneously on the same document.\nThe platform makes it easier for NCs to participate in the process by offering a single online tool that facilitates commenting and comment resolution by eliminating the need to compile multiple documents or complete separate forms.\nTetsuyuki Ikeda, SMB alternate member from the JPNC, highlighted their commitment to supporting both international and national experts by ensuring a smooth transition to using OSD for NC commenting. Recognizing that this new method might differ from the traditional commenting template approach used by the Japanese National Mirror Committees, we proactively prepared and shared a starter kit in Japanese in August, following the SMB resolution in June, to assist experts in adapting to this enhanced process.\nIn a significant milestone, the first international standard was successfully developed entirely using the OSD platform in August 2024. This platform has already gained significant traction, with over 8,000 experts from 74 countries actively engaged in various projects.\nOverall, the jointly IEC/ISO initiated OSD platform modernizes the standardization process, making it more efficient, collaborative and accessible. It represents a blend of evolutionary and revolutionary changes. It is an evolution because it builds on and streamlines existing processes and tools. In contrast, the shift to an entirely online platform for standards development is a significant change from the fragmented digital processes that went on before and is having a revolutionary impact on the way that experts interact and collaborate.\n“We are confident that the training material we have created will enable Japanese experts to work efficiently in the OSD platform”, says Atsuko."

        "abstract": "Q-Day is when quantum computers become powerful enough to break today's most widely used encryption algorithms. Here is how international standards can help organizations to prepare.",
        "content": "In the end, it was a false alarm. The reports that Chinese researchers had used a quantum computer to break military-grade encryption turned out not to be true, but they did serve as a stark reminder that when Q-Day does happen, it will obliterate privacy and security as we know it.\nQ-Day is what they call the moment when quantum computers become powerful enough to break the encryption algorithms that currently secure the internet and digital communication. Most scientists predict that it will happen within the next 20 years, although some believe it may be sooner.\nUntil powerful quantum computers emerge, public key cryptography systems, such as RSA, remain secure against quantum attacks. The threat is so great that scientists have been warning us for several years to start using quantum-resilient encryption now. \nPublic key encryption\nThe challenge is that everything from messaging and online banking to national defence systems rely on complex mathematical algorithms to scramble information. RSA encryption is regarded as one of the safest ways of protecting sensitive data from hackers. \nIt works by giving users two keys: a public key, shared with everyone, as well as a private key. The sender encrypts a message by using the receiver’s public key in order that only the intended recipient can unlock it with her or his private key. \nEven though the public key is freely available, the numbers involved are sufficiently large to make it very difficult to reverse the encryption process with only the public key.\nWould-be hackers have to break the large number into two smaller numbers that, when multiplied together, give them the original large number. The computers we use today are unable to break down numbers – jnown as factor integers – that are longer than the 2048 bits used in the most commonly employed RSA encryption. \nShor’s algorithm\nFirst, the bad news: 20 years ago, the mathematician Peter Shor developed an algorithm for quantum computers that can find the prime factors of an integer.\nFor the time being, practical limitations hinder its ability to pose a real-world threat to RSA. Building a universal quantum computer with a sufficient number of stable qubits remains a significant challenge for researchers. \nQuantum encryption\nThe good news is that cryptographers have been looking to the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve greater security. Quantum cryptography, like quantum computing, is based on the behaviour of quantum particles. \nFor example, an encryption system called quantum key distribution (QKD) encodes messages using the properties of light particles. \nThe only way for hackers to unlock the key is to measure the particles, but the very act of measuring changes the behaviour of the particles, causing errors that trigger security alerts. It is a Schrodinger’s cat-style challenge that makes it impossible for hackers to hide the fact that they have seen the data.\nHow international standards are helping\nISO/IEC 23837-1 and ISO/IEC 23837-2 are international standards related to the security of QKD systems.\nISO/IEC 23837-1 specifies a general framework for the security evaluation of QKD modules. It includes a baseline set of common security functional requirements for both the conventional network components and the quantum optical components of QKD systems \nThe international standard also outlines the entire implementation of QKD protocols and analyzes potential security problems that QKD modules might face in their operational environment. \nISO/IEC 23837-2 focuses on the test and evaluation methods for the security evaluation of QKD systems. It describes the evaluation activities necessary to test the security functional requirements of QKD protocols, quantum optical components, and conventional network components.  \nThese standards are the work of the joint IEC and ISO technical committee JTC 1/SC 27. It is responsible for developing international management and technical standards for information security and privacy protection and related topics. \nThe scope of SC 27 includes developing standards for the security and privacy protection of systems, information technologies, processes and services.\nJTC 3\nA new joint technical committee for quantum technologies, JTC 3, is working on standards for all aspects of quantum, including computing, metrology, sources, detectors, communications and fundamental quantum technologies."

        "content": "An estimated 759 million people around the world don’t have a reliable source of electricity and more than 80% of them live in Sub-Saharan Africa. But without access to clean, modern energy, it is impossible to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to reduce poverty, broaden education and improve public health.\nElectricity is the foundation on which all socio-economic development goals rest on, so efforts that contribute to enabling its access in a clean and affordable way contribute to progress in many other areas.\nChallenges remain, however, including geographical and economic, which is where off-grid autonomous power systems provide a valuable solution.\nAt COP 29, IEC will be furthering the conversation around many such challenges through a number of sessions at the Standards Pavilion, the dedicated space for advancing climate action with standards, held at the Blue Zone, B15.\nThese include:\nElectrifying hard to reach areas\n12 November, 16.30-17.30 – Making off-grid energy more accessible and efficient \nIEC is doing a vast amount of work around low voltage direct current (LVDC), which is facilitating access to hard-to-electrify regions with affordable on and off grid solutions. International experts will be sharing details about IEC standardization work around this at COP 29, further advancing international collaboration that can take this work to those who need it most.\n14 November, 08.45-09.45 – Finance and standards for scaling renewable energy\nEnabling worldwide access to clean and affordable energy will require significant investment, as well as policies and regulatory frameworks to support it. Standards and conformity assessment play a critical role in the implementation of policies and incentivizing initiatives to mobilize capital and ensure it is put to good use.\nAn example of this is the IEC Global Impact Fund, which is putting relevant standards into action in rural Africa, enabling the benefits of IEC expertise and know-how to connect communities with clean energy and empower them to stay connected, safely and sustainably.\nThis session will bring together key players from the Fund as well as those in global finance, standardization and renewable energy to identify key challenges and opportunities on the path to a clean energy future. \nIEC collaborating globally for energy efficiency solutions\n15 November, 09.00-10.00 – Energy efficiency standards harmonization\nTogether with experts from industry and international organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), IEC will be extending the conversation on a harmonized approach to energy efficiency standards.\nThe dedicated session at the Standards Pavilion will focus on the critical role of energy efficiency in climate action, in particular the goal of doubling energy efficiency improvements globally. It will also highlight the importance of harmonized national standards which have successfully advanced climate goals, and how IEC can help in scaling up these efforts globally.\nMaking diverse voices heard\n18 November, 10.00-11.00 – Bridging generations: A youthful outlook for the future\nAccess to energy for everyone requires all voices to be heard and perspectives to be considered. Recognizing the importance of this, IEC will also have a dedicated session to highlight the importance of including diverse voices and engaging young experts in the dialogue for climate action and the role of standards in ensuring these solutions are effective and equitable.\nDuring the session an IEC Young Professional will share their insights on standardization work being used to drive innovation and sustainability.\nIEC will also be engaging with several other organizations like the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Utilities for Net Zero Alliance (UNEZA), Alliance for Industry Decarbonization (AFID), RMI, CLASP, Council of Engineers for the Energy Transition (CEET) and more to extend the conversation around energy efficiency, circularity and industry decarbonization.\nAll sessions will be livestreamed.

        "abstract": "From racism to false medical diagnoses, unwanted bias in AI systems can have significant consequences. But intended bias can be highly useful. How can we ensure one without the other?",
        "content": "From discriminating against race in loan applications to making errors in medical diagnoses, unwanted bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems can have significant consequences. On the flip side, intended bias can be highly useful such as in screening for risk profiles in loan applications or introducing a bias towards a gender or race to make up for known societal biases such as in industries where there is underrepresentation.\nSo how does bias occur? AI systems learn from data, and thus can end up reflecting biases that already exist in society or occur due to errors in the design of the system, or poor-quality data.\nLearned biases in a system can then amplify or exacerbate the problem, potentially favouring or disregarding groups of people, objects, concepts or outcomes. To complicate things more, removing one kind of bias could create others. All of which can lead to poor results. As AI systems are often used to help with decision making, unwanted biases are, therefore, problematic.\nThe errors that result from unwanted bias can also erode trust in AI systems and reduce the potential benefits that this new technology can bring. Which is why the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, has just developed a standard to help.\nISO/IEC TS 12791 outlines the steps that can be taken to treat unwanted bias when developing or even using AI systems. It can particularly help to treat unwanted bias in machine learning systems that conduct classification and regression tasks.\nIt outlines aspects such as which stakeholders need to be considered, the needs of those stakeholders, data sources, testing and evaluation. It also provides various techniques to address unwanted bias such as algorithmic, training and data techniques. It is based on ISO/IEC TR 24027 which provides methods and techniques for measuring and assessing bias,\nAdam Leon Smith, project leader of the standard said identifying and treating bias is an active area of research and is increasingly complex as AI systems evolve.\n“One of the key challenges is determining what bias is actually needed or what is negative and unwanted,” he said.\n“Age-profiling can be considered unacceptable when it comes to job applications, for example, but important when evaluating medical treatments. Other biases can creep in from existing societal biases and become challenging to recognize, particularly where multiple AI applications are used. Preventing and treating unwanted bias is possible, and extremely important, in order to allow AI technology to provide the many benefits to society that it promises.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem. It looks at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight.\nHear more from Wael William Diab about SC 42 in this video.\nThe next workshop will be held on 9 and 11 December.

The election took place during the IEC General Meeting in Edinburgh, where 85 YPs, representing 45 IEC National Committees, had the opportunity to learn more about IEC standardization and conformity assessment.\nThe YP leaders will coordinate work on different aspects of standardization, based on three projects identified during the week-long YP workshop at the GM. The IEC YP Leaders for 2024 are Luiz Ferraro, an electrical engineer and occupational safety specialist from Brazil, Majid Binzawbaa, an electrical engineer and account manager from the United Arab Emirates, and Fatoumata Sangare, a cyber security expert from France.\nLuiz said: “To build a better future, we must use standards, but many people are unaware of these standards and without awareness, they won't be applied. Different ages require different approaches. I propose creating a file about standards and having various age groups translate it for younger audiences. For example, 10-year-olds could translate it for 6-year-olds. This way, children can grow up knowing about standards”.\nMajid said: “I’ve been inspired by this incredible cohort and the potential we have to achieve something remarkable together. As YP Leader, I aim to drive initiatives that benefit the IEC in the long term while providing YPs with opportunities for personal growth, strong professional connections, and meaningful recognition. \n“I have a project in mind that will set new benchmarks and create lasting impact, empowering YPs to leave a legacy within the IEC community. Let’s embark on a journey where we have fun, make a real difference, and celebrate each other’s contributions along the way”. \nFatoumata said: “As lawyer, without technical training, standards allowed me to use my skills to carry out conformity assessment and cyber security project management. My aim is to give back to standardization what it has given me. I therefore intend to put my skills at the service of the YP programme and the IEC more generally, to lead a group project - including men and women - to raise awareness of young people challenges and women empowerment.”\nIEC Young Professionals Programme\nAt the end of their mandate, the three leaders will attend the next YP workshop at the 2025 IEC GM in India, where they will support the incoming group of young professionals.\nSince its launch in 2010, the IEC Young Professionals Programme has offered a platform for the next generation of experts to contribute to standardization and conformity assessment and bring a new perspective to the IEC community. The GM provides an opportunity for YPs to meet and engage with industry leaders, standardization experts and IEC officers. \nGet involved!\nIf you would like to take part next year, contact your IEC National Committee to find out about the YP selection process.

        "content": "Deploying renewables for electricity generation is essential to meeting the world’s climate action targets. By 2030, renewable power is expected to surpass 10 terawatts globally, nearly quadrupling the current capacity.  \nThis projection also brings the current limitations of the existing infrastructure into sharp focus. In coming decades grid networks need to be more robust and flexible. Modernizing the current infrastructure and expanding the transmission systems are therefore on government priority lists to enable their clean energy transition efforts.\nDigital twin technologies could prove to be the key to accelerating the quest for more resilient, efficient, and sustainable power systems.\n \nWhat benefits can digital twins bring to the energy sector?\nDigital twins in the energy sector are digital – and often real time – representations of the physical grid assets.\nEffective use of digital twin technologies can help grid planners and grid operators manage their systems efficiently, helping them overcome infrastructural challenges of dealing with load growth, variability of renewable energy, and extreme weather.\nDigital twins help utility companies improve planning and specifications, operational efficiency and personnel training. They offer a way to stress-test important assets and systems in preparation for a wide range of scenarios, including severe weather episodes.\nThey can also help industry meet net-zero goals and adapt to climate change by helping planners monitor and identify design alternatives to reduce carbon emissions.\nThe technology will be even more important as we grow into a more connected society, with different sectors having to work closely with each other to leverage synergies. For example, the electricity sector will need to work closely with the emerging green hydrogen sector and with other energy related systems such as the electric vehicle network. Digital twins can help the effective realization of such complex systems, by ensuring efficient data exchange, and identifying gaps and synergies.\n \nNew IEC White Paper analyzes the potential opportunities\n\nThe new IEC White Paper on Virtualizing power systems: how digital twins will revolutionize the energy sector focuses on the benefits digital twins can bring. Addressing challenges in such an implementation, the paper recommends among other solutions, the adoption of core standards for describing underlying data models, and to create secure open data exchange policies.\nThe paper provides recommendations for tangible actions that government agencies, standards bodies, and digital twin stakeholders can take to unlock the potential of digital twin technologies and their revolutionary impact on the energy sector of the future.\n\nThe white paper has been prepared by a project team representing a variety of organizations, working under the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) and can be found here."

        "content": "In an era of fraud and fakes, fingerprinting is one of the few (almost) fake proof methods of identification, and despite being around for centuries, it continues to thrive. Used daily to open phones and convict criminals, it is a widely used tool for crossing borders and is soon to be introduced by the EU for non-EU citizens when entering the Schengen area.\nUnlike regular passwords, PINS or passports, fingerprints are very unique and hard to copy, making them a strong choice for security. They sit in the family of biometrics that includes facial and vocal recognition, iris scans and vein patterns, and is increasingly used because it is just so accurate and impossible to fake.\nThere is also a growing trend for its use in the payment sector. Some studies show that biometrics, including fingerprinting, is expected to authenticate more than USD3 trillion of payments in 2025, up from USD404 billion in 2020.\nFingerprints are the impressions left by the friction ridge skin at the tips of fingers, which is unique to each person. There is evidence they were used to identify people as early as 300 BC in China, but it wasn’t until 1886 that British doctor and scientist Henry Faulds, took the idea of fingerprinting to Scotland Yard, and just a few years later the first homicide was solved using fingerprint evidence in Argentina.\nLong gone are the days of putting ink on fingers, and these days fingerprint readers capture fingerprint images using optical sensors. Capturing the image correctly is crucial to determining the final image quality, which is in turn necessary to ensure the system works.\nThe international standard for finger image data, ISO/IEC 29794-4, specifies finger image quality measures to ensure the images are good enough to be used for recognition. It has just been updated to ensure it remains relevant for today’s environment.\nInternational standards are used to define the requirements for much of biometric technology, such as fingerprinting, so that they are safe, performant and interoperable around the world.\nISO/IEC 29794-4 is just one of over 140 international standards by the IEC and ISO joint committee for biometrics, SC 37, that provides international best practice and guidance on everything from the performance and safety of biometrics to addressing key concerns around cyber security, data privacy and ethical issues."

        "abstract": "How quantum technologies are helping to improve our world, with the support of international standards.",
        "content": "When we think of quantum, it is often quantum computing that comes to mind.\nBut quantum computing is just one aspect of quantum technology, which, in fact, is nothing new. Quantum physics has been revolutionizing our world for over a hundred years, responsible for technologies as diverse and divisive as nuclear weapons and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nAccording to a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) the power of quantum resides on its capability to advance every one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here are a few ways how:\nA powerful weapon against climate change\nQuantum sensors are extremely sensitive, able to detect miniscule changes in elements such as temperature or pressure with enormous precision.\nThis can be used to dramatically improve energy efficiency in buildings and grids, for example, through its ability to detect and monitor usage, failures and leaks.\nQuantum technologies can also be used to detect minute variations in gravity and thus mass density, allowing them to accurately spot material changes or voids under the ground, which in turn could be used to predict sink hole formation and map complex tunnel structures. It can also play a role in monitoring environmental changes, such as greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature variations in the atmosphere and oceans which is necessary to mitigate climate change impacts.\nQuantum materials are promising innovative technologies for energy efficiency and clean energy production. For example, high temperature superconductors can conduct electricity much more efficiently, while quantum dot solar cells have the potential to increase conversion of sunlight into electricity by up to 66%.\nMore accurate navigation\nQuantum is revolutionizing navigation by enabling more accurate positioning than current GPS capabilities, and with the potential to overcome current GPS limitations, such as outages when out of range, as well as cyberattacks.\nQuantum sensors are also resistance to noise and interference, which can cause errors in current navigation systems and can operate at much higher speeds and in environments where classical sensors would fail, such as those with high temperatures or radiation.\nAll of which makes the technology extremely promising for aviation and space exploration, while supporting SDG 9 for industry, innovation and infrastructure.\nMedical breakthroughs\nQuantum sensing also has the potential for innovative medical discoveries through its ability to measure electromagnetic fields of the brain and other organs, which is laying the foundations for technologies such as brain-computer interfaces. Quantum imaging techniques could allow for more accurate, high-resolution imaging of internal organs that could revolutionize disease diagnosis.\nIt is also paving the way for more personalized and less invasive medical treatments, for example by being able to monitor things like radiation levels during cancer therapy.\nSecure communication\nQuantum cryptography is a way of encrypting and transmitting data based on the laws of quantum mechanics, and therefore, theoretically, unhackable.\nUnless quantum computers evolve to be able to decrypt them, of course, which may or may not ever happen. If it does, it could break many of the encryption schemes that are currently used, such as in banking transactions, personal data and blockchain, which would have disastrous effects, such as potentially making all cryptocurrencies worthless.\nInternational standards present a valuable opportunity to help tackle this problem while at the same time enabling the benefits of quantum to be realized without the risks. A lot of work is already underway.\nThe joint IEC and ISO technical committee for Quantum technologies, JTC 3, is working on standards for all aspects of quantum, including computing, metrology, sources, detectors, communications and fundamental quantum technologies.\nLearn more in the latest edition of e-tech."

While standards and regulations guide manufacturers and product testers, how can we be sure that those doing the testing are up to the job?\nThe IECEE is the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment. The IECEE Schemes address the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of components, devices and equipment for homes, offices, workshops, health facilities among others.\nIts Peer Assessment Programme is designed to ensure those carrying out certification processes do so in the most competent way. The result is that that those who participate in the IECEE’s programmes, such as all IECEE National Certification Bodies (NCBs) and testing laboratories (CBTLs) apply IECEE rules and procedures consistently and fully comply with them.\nIn this way, it enables its members to use the principle of mutual recognition (reciprocal acceptance) of test results to obtain certification or approval at national levels around the world. It also builds confidence among participants and the marketplace as well as trust in mutual recognition.\nMore than 200 participants from the Asian region met in Beijing, China this week to undergo the training, which includes not only assessment administration and practices, but a wide range of other important elements such as impartiality, how to identify infringements, working in foreign language environments, measurement uncertainty and more.\nHeld with the support of the IECEE Member Body for China and TÜV Rheinland Beijing, the training also featured discussions and the sharing of experiences for testing and certification in a number of areas. These include cyber security, functional safety, solar photovoltaic components, household appliances and electric vehicles.\nWolfram Zeitz, the Executive Secretary for IECEE said the training event was also an opportunity to bring assessors together to discuss if changes or improvements need to be made to the assessment processes.\n“Continuous improvement is always the goal and this week was a great opportunity to achieve that.”\nFind out more about the IECEE."

        "content": "It all started with a peanut bar. An engineer named Percy Spencer was visiting a lab where magnetrons - electron tubes for amplifying or generating microwaves - were being tested and the sweet snack in his pocket started to cook. He then put popcorn kernels near it and they exploded everywhere, a scene that was illustrated and used when he filed for the patents to use microwaves for cooking food in 1946.\nSince then, microwave ovens have transformed the lives of many, though it hasn’t always been an easy ride. In the 1970s in the USA the market for microwave ovens took a plunge when the Consumers Union warned of uncertainty around radiation effects. But after much testing and the introduction of stringent microwave emission limits and safety requirements - as set out in IEC standards - these fears were largely abated.\nHigh levels of safety and performance of microwave ovens are still required today and the standards for them are constantly reviewed to ensure they take into account any technological or market changes. One of these – IEC 60705, Household microwave ovens - Methods for measuring performance – has just been updated. It includes elements such as cooking and defrosting performance - tested on numerous different foods, ranging from raspberries to meatloaf - as well as power output and how to calculate the energy consumption of a cooking cycle, which is important for energy efficiency.\nIEC have a number of international standards for microwave ovens. These include:\nIEC 60335-1: Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 1: General requirements. This standard sets out the general safety requirements for household and similar electrical appliances, including microwave ovens, and covers the safety requirements for the capacitors, such as their insulation and overvoltage protection.\nIEC 60335-2-25: Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-25: Particular requirements for microwave ovens, including combination microwave ovens, deals with the safety of microwave ovens for household and similar use.\nIEC 61000-3-2:  Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 3-2: Limits - Limits for harmonic current emissions (equipment input current ≤16 A per phase). This standard sets limits for the harmonic current emissions from microwave ovens to ensure that they do not cause interference with other electronic equipment.\nIEC 62301: Household electrical appliances - Measurement of standby power. This standard specifies methods for measuring the power consumed by appliances in standby mode, including microwave ovens.\nAll of these standards are covered by the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components. IECEE provides the assurance that tested and certified products meet the strictest levels of safety, reliability and performance as stipulated by the relevant international standards."

Hoping to make it easier to spot is a new international collaboration that brings together leading experts on AI and multimedia authenticity. \nHistory is full of fake media. Anyone in doubt should read Shakespeare or look at the portraits of Richard III that depict the English King as a twisted and deformed hunchback, with narrow, dark eyes and thin, cruel lips.\nThanks to modern scanning technology we now know that the paintings were altered by Tudor propagandists to create the evil monster that Shakespeare called a “poisonous bunch-backed toad”.  A facial reconstruction based on the skull of Richard III suggests that he was somewhat better looking, while his skeleton reveals that while he was short of stature, he did not have a humped back.\nWhat if we could apply technology to revel the truth about fake media on the internet? That’s the thinking behind the new multistakeholder collaboration on international standards for AI watermarking, multimedia authenticity and deepfake detection technologies.\nThose taking part include the three international standards developers, IEC, ITU and ISO, along with the likes of the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).\nThe launch of the initiative comes as a new study reveals widespread concern in the United States about the impact of misinformation on the 2024 presidential election. Nearly ninety per cent of respondents to the Adobe survey said the rise of generative AI had made it more challenging to discern fact from fiction online.\nIt’s a reminder of the stakes at play. The Adobe Study highlights how fake media has eroded trust in even reputable media sources, as well as the manipulation of public opinion and the threat to social stability. \nWhat is often forgotten is that fake media can also harm ordinary people. Deepfakes have damaged reputations, caused emotional distress and led to financial loss. \nThe AI and Multimedia Authenticity Standards (AMAS) initiative is responding to one of the most urgent threats of our time. This urgency is reflected in the Adobe report, which found an overwhelming level of support for tagging all media with attribution details to determine what is trustworthy.\nRead more about standardization for detecting deepfakes and generative AI: download the free ITU report here."

There is a clear recognition that no one entity alone can do it. But together we can all do it”\nKatharine Fraga, Director of Membership, Affiliates and Capacity Building at the IEC highlighted a successful example of collaboration between IEC, ISO and ITU, “For decades IEC has been working very closely with both ISO and ITU under the banner of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC). Thanks to the close collaboration of the three organizations, we've fundamentally changed the digital landscape. Together, we've worked on topical issues such as artificial intelligence, smart cities, smart farming, circular economy, e-waste, cyber security, and many, many more.”\nShe also highlighted the recent ambitious project WSC undertook to harness standardization for combating the use of AI in developing and propagating deepfake and misinformation.\nAnother key project discussed was the IEC Global Impact Fund for advancing direct impact on ground. The Fund’s inaugural project aims to address critical human needs, including good health (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).\nBuilding on this discourse, Dorina Nati, Industrial Development Officer at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) raised the point around equitable and inclusive development.\nSpeaking of the need for global cooperation, she also emphasised on knowledge-sharing within countries, “But are we prepared to interconnect and share data and information? And are we prepared to leave no one behind in this process that is so complex also from a perspective of developed countries?”\nIn this context, she stressed the need for partnerships, especially for developing countries, to ensure that everybody is invited to be at the table, and that everybody has the capacity to actively contribute to this discussion.\nBy bringing together diverse stakeholders, the webinar aimed to inspire collective action and showcase the transformative potential of partnerships in building a sustainable and resilient future. \n\nYou can learn more about the insights shared by the other speakers and IEC’s work in the webinar recording."

With the evolution of QR reading technology such as smart phones and cameras, the use of QR codes has been growing steadily over the years, but it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that their use really skyrocketed.\nThese days, QR codes are everywhere, heavily used in advertising, marketing, manufacturing, warehouse stock control, ticketing and product labelling and more, and have more recently been used to store bank account or credit card information to enable QR code payment. They are also being used to detect counterfeit products and in product traceability.\nThe QR code is a type of 2-D matrix barcode made up of symbols which consist of an array of nominally square modules arranged in an overall square pattern.\nThere are actually four different models in the QR code family:\n\nQR code model one, the original specification;\nQR code model two, an enhanced form with additional features and its symbols are fully compatible with QR code reading systems;\nQR code, a modified version of model two that has the facility for symbols to appear in a mirror image; and\nMicro QR code format which enables a smaller amount of data to be represented in a small symbol, thus more suitable for direct marketing on parts and components.\n\nQR code is the recommended model for new, open system applications. The international standard that defines it, ISO/IEC 18004, is thus globally recognized as the standard that describes QR code fully.\nIt has just been updated to keep it up to date and aligned with technological trends.

We want to avoid any duplication,” he said.\nThe SyC provides a communication platform, where TCs can exchange information and highlight their work, during events like this workshop, he added. The idea is for the SyC to work precisely on topics like digital twins, which are not standardized by only one committee. “We look at cross cutting topics and issues,” he reminded the audience. Crucially, the SyC does not generally develop international standards but different systems reference documents.\nThe SyC is also an incubator looking at new areas of tech and interest. “For instance we are looking at smart hydropower and what needs to be done in the future to address this area. Do we need to create a new TC? Are some TCs already looking at this issue?” he listed.\nDifferent definitions for digital twin\nFrançois Coallier, the Chair of IEC/ISO JTC 1/ SC 41, also introduced the work of his subcommittee, which has part of its scope dedicated to standardizing digital twin and which is generally involved in preparing foundational and horizontal standards for the Internet of Things (IoT).  “ The IoT is not a technology but a systems concept which uses many technologies like digital twin,” he explained. His SC works closely with many other TCs, like TC 65, which prepares standards for industrial digital twins, and the SyC Smart Energy. “Cooperation is the name of the game,” he insisted. “Our foundational standards are to be used by other TCs as they specify global architectures,” he added.\nDetlef Tenhagen is the convenor of the group inside SC 41 which is standardizing digital twin. He explained the six different standards developed by the group, which are horizontal, he said, and which can be adapted in vertical applications like smart manufacturing or transportation. He also gave his working group’s definition of digital twin, as they are many different ones floating around. “ A digital twin is a digital representation of a target entity with data connections which enable convergence between the physical and digital states at an appropriate rate of synchronization.” He explained that this was the IT definition but that TC 65, which has defined digital twins for industrial use, has settled on “asset administration shell”.\nOther presentations were made by TC experts involved in the energy sector, including TC 57, which develops core standards for the smart grid, notably on the modelling of power systems with the electrical common information model, and energy automation devices with IEC 61850. An expert from TC 8, which among other things standardizes de-centralized electricity supply systems (e.g. microgrids and off-grid renewables) presented the work done on the modelling of renewable energy generation for power system dynamic analysis.\nWhat are the next steps?\nNext steps were defined, with the SyC agreeing to prepare an action plan by the end of the year, based on what was discussed in the workshop. Issues that need to be fixed will be identified and a systems referral document published in due course.\nFor more information, watch the full workshop."

        "abstract": "A new series of standards is being developed for the use of industrial digital twins, looking at aspects like cyber security, use cases and interfaces.",
        "content": "Digital twins can be defined as real time virtual representations of physical assets. They are already used by industry for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the quantification and prediction of the amount of greenhouse gases generated by the manufacturing process throughout its lifecycle to the stress-testing of important systems and devices and even personnel training. \nAlthough the technology is already used, there are as yet few benchmarks to specify it, especially on an international level. The IEC has been paving the way for this to change. In 2023, it released the first part of a series of standards on industrial digital twins – called asset administration shells – which defined the basic concept of the technology for industrial applications. “Part one defines the basic structure of the digital twin for industrial applications. We had to build consensus in the IEC community around the scope of the standard. We had very fruitful discussions and we managed to publish IEC 63278-1 successfully,” describes Jens Gayko, an expert from the working group which published the standard.\nAt least four more parts are being worked on to make the use of industrial digital twins seamless and secure. Part 2 of the standard, which is at committee draft level, is dealing with the information metadata model, with a view to be machine readable, and in preparation for smart standards. The third part will standardize cyber security aspects, the fourth, uses cases, and the fifth, interfaces and interoperability. “In part 2, we define the sub-model templates, one of which is the common data dictionary standardized by IEC TC 3. We are also in close contact with the colleagues dealing with smart standards and the idea is to use the same concepts, so that all the different pieces of the puzzle fit together,” Jens Gayko explains.\nIn part 3, access control to industrial digital twins will be specified. “In an industrial environment you don’t want to share all the information with everybody, and therefore you need to ensure that mechanisms for access control exist. Some information is confidential and only available to business partners or sometimes not even them. We will be working on the basis of the IEC 62243 standards for cyber security,” he says.\nPart four and five are still at the very early stages of development. One of the challenges is to get a good mix of experts from the IT world and the smart manufacturing and automation companies to work together.\n“We have fifty people from around the world, including China, Japan and Korea, in addition to major European countries working together. We feel confident that we will be able to produce a very complete and useful series of standards, “ Gayko concludes."

Several tools exist to help experts navigate the issue. A recently updated guidance document published by the IEC and ISO joint strategic advisory group on gender responsive standards (GRS) can be found here. It aims to provide standards developers and all technical committee (TC, SC, PC, SyC) and working group (WG) participants with important considerations and questions to aid them in ensuring the standards they are developing are gender responsive. In addition, an online learning module is available to all experts.\nLastly, since August of this year, several case studies have been collected and are published in a booklet which can be found here. They are meant to help ISO and IEC experts see how gender aspects can concretely be included in standards.\nAnother concrete demonstration of how gender impacts standard development can be found in this webinar.  Participants presented several IEC standards, for instance TC 61 standards which are developed  for household and commercial appliances. Other ones were TC 106 standards which notably look at the specific absorption rate (SAR) of electro-magnetic waves by different groups of people, including women.\nIn coming months, an official IEC and ISO guide for GRS will be published, along the lines of other guides, such as the one published on disability access."

        "content": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer the stuff of science fiction. Big strides have been made, notably in the medical field, where researchers have demonstrated how electricity in the brain can be used to help tetraplegic patients walk or reduce the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s. Other applications outside the medical field include gaming, education, authentication and even driving.\nIn order to explain the technology and the requirement for standards, a day-long online symposium organized by IEC and ISO with top-level speakers from the standards, neuroscience and medical fields is to take place on 4 September.\nAmong the topics broached will be the ethics of using BCIs, how invasive should they be, how the data revealed can be protected alongside our human rights - and how standards can help. But the tech itself will be evoked as well - notably how far it can go, what can it do and in which areas. (To find out more about the topics and the top-level speakers involved and to register, click here and here.)\nStandards for BCIs \nIEC and ISO are paving the way for BCIs to be used safely and efficiently. As part of their joint efforts to produce standards for information technology, they recently established a subcommittee to standardize brain computer interfaces. While it is expected to standardize BCIs for many areas, it will avoid producing standards for implants and the medical field, leaving those areas to other IEC Technical Committees. \nTC 62 prepares standards for medical equipment, software and systems. Its work is increasingly focusing on the use of artificial intelligence in medical applications, while one of the four IEC conformity assessment systems, IECEE, offers testing and certification for the safety, reliability, efficiency and overall performance of electrical equipment for medical use, in relation to IEC International Standards.\nThe IEC has also  set up a System Committee on Active Assisted Living (SyC AAL), which focuses on the standardization of AAL products, services and systems to enable independent living for elderly or disabled users. It also enables cross-vendor interoperability of AAL systems, services, products and components. AAL systems and products may include alarm systems, wearables and even, if they ever become ubiquitous, brain-computer interfaces."

        "published_day": "2024-08-22",
        "abstract": "Addressing issues such as bias from the outset is crucial. The entire portfolio of ISO/IEC AI standards integrates ethical considerations.",
        "content": "In TV shows, it is always the middle of the night when the crime scene investigators arrive, wearing gloves and protective suits to avoid contaminating the evidence. Usually, they start off by assessing the scene, noting the location and condition of the body, as well as noticing obvious evidence, like blood spatter, weapons, or signs of a struggle. What they don’t tell you in the show is that at this point the outcome may already be compromised as the CSIs are introducing cognitive bias into the investigation. \nThat is why researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently looking into ways of harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to improve forensic methodology. They are using eye-trackers to study the gaze patterns of forensic scientists to compare against verbal accounts of what the investigators said they looked at and in what order they collected evidence.  The UCL researchers are feeding the data they collect into a machine-learning system to evaluate current investigations and possibly develop new and improved methodologies.  \nCognitive bias happens when we create our own \"subjective reality\" from our perception of a specific situation or piece of information.  The different kinds of cognitive bias can significantly impact crime scene investigations in several ways. For instance, investigators might focus on evidence that supports their initial theory while overlooking or dismissing evidence that contradicts it. If they believe that particular suspect is guilty, they might give more weight to evidence that confirms this belief and ignore evidence pointing to another suspect. This kind of cognitive bias is called confirmation bias.\nThe presence of certain contextual information, such as knowing a suspect has a criminal record, can influence how forensic examiners interpret ambiguous evidence. This is known as contextual bias. Closely related to this is stereotype bias, such as racism, misogyny and ageism, which reflects overgeneralized beliefs or assumptions about a group of people based on shared characteristics. \nThe anchoring effect occurs when investigators rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive (the \"anchor\") and fail to adjust their thinking in light of new evidence. For instance, if the first witness they interview suggests a specific suspect, they might be less open to considering other suspects. \nAn example of availability bias, also known as availability heuristic, is investigators giving undue importance to evidence or scenarios that are more readily available in their memory, often because they are more recent or emotionally charged. \nSampling bias could occur in witness selection, evidence collection — for example, focusing on fingerprints and ignoring DNA evidence — or suspect identification, if the pool of suspects is not representative of the population, among others. \nCognitive bias has played a significant role in some of the worst cases of miscarriages of justice. In 1989, for instance, five teenagers were wrongfully convicted of assaulting a jogger in Central Park, New York. Confirmation bias and contextual bias played significant roles in their wrongful convictions. The real perpetrator confessed in 2002. In the UK, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully accused of theft, fraud and false accounting due to faults in the Post Office's Horizon IT system. Cognitive biases, such as authority bias and confirmation bias, led to these wrongful convictions.\nBias in artificial intelligence\nOf course, bias is not confined to the justice system.  It permeates every aspect of who we are and what we do.\nWe are all conditioned by our environments and experiences and carry with us different kinds of social, political or values-based baggage.\nSometimes our horizons are not as broad as we would like to think and as a result, the vast volumes of data used to train algorithms are not always sufficiently variegated or diverse. When AI generates biased results it is because human biases have skewed the original training data or algorithm.\nThis leads to distorted outputs and potentially harmful outcomes. It is a case of garbage in, garbage out as tecnologies like machine learning simply look for patterns in the data we feed it: garbage in, garbage out.\nThe good news is that bias can be detected and mitigated quite easily. The bad news is that it can be difficult to get to the bottom of how algorithms are making decisions in order to solve the problems, as more often than not they operate within a “black box”. It is one of the most important challenges we face, as algorithms are increasingly at the centre of our daily lives, from search engines and online shopping to job applications and bank loans. \nUnintended biases in AI systems can have significant consequences. Unlike traditional IT systems, AI systems have the capability to learn, which offers great potential but also significant risks. The IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, has developed a portfolio of international standards that cover a range of these challenges, from trustworthiness to addressing ethical considerations in applications, such as eavesdropping and of course, bias.\nSC 42 approaches the problem from multiple perspectives, considering the application, developer, and deployer viewpoints. For instance, alongside SC 42 work on trustworthiness, they offer comprehensive standards for the data quality used in AI systems. Their standards also address computational aspects and AI governance. These efforts are unified through a management system standard (MSS) that organizations can use for auditing and conformity assessment of their systems.\nAddressing issues such as bias from the outset is crucial. The entire portfolio of ISO/IEC AI standards integrates ethical considerations. Additionally, SC 42 provides standards that work across different vertical domains. This means collaborating with individual IEC and ISO technical committees to develop AI solutions for specific applications. SC 42 also supports IEC and ISO committees by providing foundational standards to ensure their applications are responsible, trustworthy, ethical and deliver the intended benefits."

The masterclass on IEC 62368-1:2023 provides an overview of the standard and its legacy, its basic principles and areas of application.\nThe international standard IEC 62368-1, takes a hazard-based approach to the safety of electrical and electronic devices. It also makes it easier to introduce new technologies to the marketplace.\nIntroducing IEC 62368-1:2023\nIEC 62368-1 is applicable to the safety of electrical and electronic equipment within the field of audio, video, information and communication technology, and business and office machines with a rated voltage not exceeding 600 V. It does not include requirements for performance or functional characteristics of the equipment.\nThe standard’s focus on energy safety gives manufacturers greater freedom to explore hardware technologies and will have a major impact on the design of new products. The main hazards are electric shock; electrically-caused fire; hazardous substances (chemical exposure); mechanical (stability, sharp edges, moving parts); thermal burns (hot surfaces); and radiation (laser, ionizing, acoustic).\nIEC 62368-1 clearly identifies potentially hazardous energy sources in order to put safeguards into place. It defines a safeguard as a device or scheme or system that either is interposed between a hazardous energy source and a body part, or that prevents hazardous energy from transferring to or from a body part.\nIEC 62368-1 is the work of IEC Technical Committee 108, which was set up with the responsibility of developing safety standards for electronic devices in the areas of audio/video, and ICT. It merged the work areas covered by TC 92 (audio/video and electronic equipment for household use) and TC 74 (data processing equipment).\nAbout the masterclass\nThe IEC Academy Masterclass supports professionals involved in standardization to help expand their knowledge of specific IEC International Standards. Professionals involved in industry, regulation and academia can benefit from this masterclass and receive a holistic overview of specific standards, including essential definitions and implementation use cases.\nThe masterclass on IEC 62368-1:2023 provides an overview of the standard and its legacy, its basic principles and areas of application. Participants will have the opportunity to connect directly with the IEC experts who developed the standard and ask questions in real time.\nThe masterclass will cover four central topics:\n\n\nScope and structure of the standard\n\n\nHazard-based safety engineering principles and energy sources\n\n\nHazards and safeguards\n\n\nHighlight changes compared to the previous edition \n\n\nThe masterclass will take place on 25 September 2024 and will be fully virtual.

        "content": "Batteries are a key ingredient in reaching net-zero climate goals, needed to store energy from renewable sources for use when it is needed most.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, batteries are an essential part of the global energy system today and the fastest growing energy technology on the market.\nBut manufacturing batteries incurs both financial and environmental costs. What’s more, batteries at the end of their life can release toxic pollutants if not disposed of correctly and contribute to the problem of e-waste.\nThe IEA estimates that batteries that no longer meet the standards for usage in an electric vehicle (EV) typically maintain up to 80% of their total usable capacity. Given the rising number of EVs, repurposing them offers a valuable solution for energy storage.\nYet the road to repurposed batteries is not so smooth, as technological and regulatory challenges still remain barriers to its uptake. Not only are there risks in the process of repurposing the batteries, but in their use as well. What’s more, many countries and regions are developing different requirements and regulations for the reuse and repurposing of batteries, potentially creating technical or safety issues.\nInternational standards are a vital tool in overcoming these challenges. The recently published IEC 63338 directly addresses this, by providing general guidance on reuse and repurposing of secondary cells and batteries. It covers the safety risks associated with lithium ion and nickel systems as well as aspects such as determining the suitability for reuse or repurposing, manufacturer’s warning notices and more.\nThe standard was developed by the IEC technical committee for secondary cells and batteries containing alkaline or other non-acid electrolytes, TC 21/SC 21A.\nIt is the latest in a number of standards by TC 21/SC 21A designed to support the safe and reliable reuse and repurposing of batteries and battery energy storage systems.\nOthers by the committee include IEC 63330-1 (general requirements for repurposing of secondary cells, modules, battery packs and battery systems), IEC 62933-4-4 (environmental requirements for battery-based energy storage systems (BESS) with reused batteries) and IEC 62933-5-3 (safety requirements for grid-integrated EES systems)."

        "abstract": "We all love to hate passwords and are not always as careful with them as we should be. The consequences of poor password management, whether by people or organizations, can be devastating.",
        "content": "In 2020, malicious hackers compromised a piece of widely used network management software made by the US cyber security firm, SolarWinds. It gave them access to the computer networks of SolarWinds customers, including US government departments, nuclear facilities, IT companies and a host of other organizations around the world.\nA security analyst had reportedly  warned SolarWinds a year earlier, in 2019, that anyone could access their update server by using the password \"solarwinds123\". It is widely believed weak password management may have been the  contributing factor behind the attack.\nIn a separate and unrelated incident in 2021, poor password management again played an important role when cyber-criminals breached Verkada, a security company that provides cameras. They gained access to up to 150,000 security cameras installed in schools, hospitals and Fortune 500 businesses. \nThe attackers used a \"super admin\" password that granted extensive access to Verkada's systems. This password was shared among over 100 internal users.\nThe absence of multi-factor authentication made it easier for the attackers to exploit the compromised credentials. Furthermore, Verkada did not have a policy of role-based access.\nCyber security for IT systems\nThe internationally accepted best practice is to limit network access to the level necessary for individuals to perform their jobs. Known as the principle of least privilege, it is one of the key measures that ISO/IEC 27001 recommends: “Users shall only be provided with access to the network and network services that they have been specifically authorized to use.”\nAnother international standard, ISO/IEC 27002 offers a host of practical advice on password management in IT systems, emphasizing the importance of strong, unique passwords, secure distribution and regular password changes to protect user accounts. It identifies three key areas for password management: password creation and distribution, user responsibilities and password management systems:\n\n\nPassword creation and distribution\n\n\nPasswords should be complex, unique and not easily guessable.\n\n\nPasswords must be transmitted securely to users.\n\n\nUser identity should be verified before providing password information.\n\n\nDefault passwords provided by vendors must be changed immediately.\n\n\n\n\nUser responsibilities\n\n\nUsers must keep passwords secret and not share them with others.\n\n\nPasswords should be changed promptly if compromised.\n\n\nUsers should create complex passwords using a mix of characters.\n\n\n\n\nPassword management system\n\n\nUsers should be able to choose and change their passwords.\n\n\nMulti-factor authentication is recommended.\n\n\nPasswords should expire regularly, especially after security incidents or employee changes.\n\n\nPrevious passwords should be prevented from being reused.\n\n\nPasswords should be stored and transmitted securely.\n\n\n\n\nThe advice in international standards is always realistic and practical. For instance, ISO/IEC 27002 warns against the dangers of password fatigue, noting that frequent password changes can be frustrating and may lead to weaker passwords.\nCyber security for operational technology (OT)\nIEC 62443 is the world’s best-known standard for the cyber security of critical infrastructure and other industrial automation and control systems (IACS). This operational technology (OT) was once offline but is now connected through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). \nFor access control, IEC 62443-2-1  also recommends the principle of least privilege for keeping safe from unauthorized access.  \nIEC 62443-3-3 is where most of the advice on measures to ensure the integrity and security of passwords can be found. It includes guidelines for complexity, uniqueness, secure storage, and regular updates.  \nThe security levels described in IEC 62443 directly impact password management. Quite simply, the higher the security level, the more stringent the requirements for password management become.\n \nRead more on this topic\nThe important role of access control"

        "abstract": "The IEC has announced the publication of the first international standard fully developed using the innovative Online Standards Development (OSD) platform.",
        "content": "Geneva, Switzerland – August 6, 2024 – The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) today announced the publication of the first international standard fully developed using the innovative Online Standards Development (OSD) platform. The publication of IEC 60512-28-100:2024 represents a landmark achievement for the international standards community. \nIt promises to set international standards development on a more collaborative, more efficient path for the future and demonstrates the IEC’s commitment to modernizing and streamlining the standards development process for everyone.\nIEC 60512-28-100:2024, Connectors for electrical and electronic equipment - Tests and measurements - Part 28-100: Signal integrity tests up to 2 000 MHz - Tests 28a to 28g, is the result of dedicated work by IEC Technical Committee 48/Subcommittee 48B (TC 48/SC 48B). This standard sets new benchmarks for signal integrity testing, ensuring high performance and reliability in connectors for electrical and electronic equipment.\nThe OSD platform, a joint initiative by the IEC and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), provides standards developers with new digital tools to streamline the process of drafting and editing international standards. The platform enhances efficiency and collaboration throughout the process, from the preparation of a standard to its final publication.\nPhilippe Metzger, the IEC Secretary-General, commented on this milestone: \"The publication of IEC 60512-28-100:2024 on the OSD platform is a testament to the IEC's dedication to innovation and excellence. This achievement not only highlights the capabilities of the OSD platform but also sets a precedent for future standards development\".\n“It was great to be part of the development process of the OSD platform, from an early adaptor to the first IEC standard developed completely online” said SC 48B project leader Peter Fischer. The learning curve was steep and the collaboration with the IEC OSD team always very fruitful, as we could directly impact the further development, which was very motivating. \n\"SC 48B was able to work with this tool successfully and I am convinced that every team can succeed. We are looking forward to start soon our next projects on the OSD platform”, Mr Fischer added.\n\nThe OSD platform enhances the accuracy and quality of standards while simplifying the development process by facilitating real-time collaboration, streamlined document management and integrated tools. The benefits of working on the OSD platform include: \n\n\nenabling authors to focus on content\n\n\nstreamlining the authoring process,\n\n\nfacilitating collaboration and consensus building\n\n\nfull integration into the IEC ecosystem\n\n\nhaving the full standards development workflow in a single online tool\n\n\neasier commenting and comment resolution.\n\n\nOSD now sits at the heart of the IEC’s offer and will continue to form the basis for the development of new standards that are aimed at addressing challenges across the electrotechnical spectrum. The use of OSD will help to ensure that the standards the world needs for the safe and sustainable use of electrical and electronic technology can be developed in a way that integrates international technical expertise in timely and efficient manner. \nMore information about IEC 60512-28-100 and the OSD platform can be found on the IEC website."

        "abstract": "Despite cyberattacks making regular headlines, many organizations remain sitting ducks and industry is a key target. A key standard in the IEC 62443 series for cyber security has just been updated.",
        "content": "Just as we brush off the dust from the recent CrowdStrike outage, where millions of computers around the world were shut down due to a corrupted cybersecurity software update, a cyber-attack on Microsoft created a global outage on their products recently. But these are not just one-off events. The cost of cybercrime globally is estimated at USD9.22 trillion and counting.\nYet despite cyberattacks making regular headlines, many organizations remain sitting ducks. According to research by cyber security firm Censys, over 430 digital systems controlling US infrastructure are vulnerable to cyberattacks. According to Censys, many of them have no passwords and anyone can access them despite the fact that they control systems like dams, water pumps and oil wells.\nIndustry remains a key target. In 2023, more than 25% of all cyber-attacks worldwide involved manufacturing companies. Ransomware was common across many subsectors, particularly when it came to metal and automotive production. In 2022, the global average cost per industrial data breach was around USD 4.73 million.\nAddressing cyber security across an industrial organization is complex because too much will strangle functionality and too little will let the hackers in. The balance lies across a number of factors, such as limiting financial risks while prioritizing health and safety.\nAnother challenge in operational technology (OT) settings such as manufacturing is that their industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. From a cybersecurity perspective, this creates added vulnerabilities.\nInternational standards help. The IEC 62443 series is designed to keep operation technology (OT) systems running throughout their lifecycle by securing the IACS. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.\nIEC 62443-2-1 provides requirements for a security programme for IACS asset owners. It describes the methodology for addressing cyber security risks in the design of an IACS system, which helps to identify risks and therefore make informed decisions regarding the appropriate security requirements.\nAn IACS security programme is configured to meet specific functional needs, thus being more robust and rigorous than an off-the-shelf product and reduces the risk of new threats being introduced. It also enables integration with the organization’s processes and information security management system.\nIEC 62443-2-1 has just been updated to ensure it keeps up with latest market needs and industry trends.\nIEC 62443-2-1 and all of the IEC 62443 series is developed by the IEC technical committee TC 65 which develops standards for industrial-process measurement, control and automation."

From the training grounds to the millions of households around the world, never before have we had so much information about an athlete’s performance or felt so immersed in the action – all thanks to 3D and 4D scanning.\n3D scanning captures the physical shape and surface details of an object or environment to create a digital 3D model. 4D scanning takes it a step further by capturing movement over time. For the Olympics, this means enabling a detailed analysis of athlete’s biomechanics which coaches and sports scientists can use to analyze performance and optimize training or to judge who is first to cross the finish line.\nBut the applications of 3D and 4D scanning go far beyond the sporting world. It can enable valuable insights for diagnosis, research, and monitoring in a wide range of fields. In healthcare 4D ultrasounds can be used to monitor fetal development in prenatal care or observe the beating heart to diagnose and treat heart conditions. It also plays a key role in the development of many other technologies.\nTo explore its potential and the role of standardization, the joint IEC and ISO committee for 3D and 4D scanning, ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 12 is holding a free public webinar:\nWebinar Details:\n\nDate: August 21, 2024\nTime: 13:00 - 16:00 CEST\nRegistration: Click here to register\n\nThe webinar will feature presentations from standardization and industry experts and cover topics including:\n\nThe current status of 3D and 4D scanning, as well as standardization projects\nICT challenges\n3D scanning technology for digital dentistry\n3D scanning and the metaverse\nStandardization projects in digital twin\nWays to get involved \n\nRegister now\nThe webinar is one of a large series of free webinars organized by the IEC Academy.

        "content": "All eyes were on the finish line when Noah Lyles beat Kishane Thompson by five-thousandths of a second to win gold in the men’s 100m final at this year’s Paris Olympic Games.\nCompare that with the Games in 1948, when the first photo-finish camera, known as the ‘Magic Eye’ was used but took several minutes to be developed and for the winning sprinter to be revealed.\nLong gone are the days when the human eye decided Olympic medallists. This year, sophisticated cameras that can capture up to 40,000 images per second work in tandem with sensors and AI to provide unprecedented accuracy and precision.\nIn addition, high-speed data transmission technology is enabling vast amounts of data to be shared in real time amongst officials, athletes, broadcasters and emergency services. Not to mention the opening ceremony, where highly sophisticated mobile phones connected via 5G technology enabled millions of viewers around the world to watch the scene that played out along several kilometres of the Seine River.\nThe advantage of 5G, said telecommunications expert Mike Wood, is that it can handle lots and lots of data and still avoid network overloading thanks to additional spectrum and greater efficiency including ‘network slicing’.\n“Network slicing is where one can have multiple private networks, which are ‘slices’ of a larger network, so they can be reserved for things like events, security and emergency services,” he said.\n“In this way, the network that handles the opening ceremony, or the one for security or the emergency services, is not affected by a huge surge in demand from the general public, which is often seen at big events such as the Olympics or at significant moments such as New Year’s Eve.”\nMike Wood is the former chair of IEC TC 106 as well as responsible for Telstra’s Electromagnetic Energy (EME) Strategy, Governance and Risk Management programme. He’s been involved in projects to test 5G capabilities in Telstra to bring more benefits to society, such as a 5G bike helmet to protect city cyclists.\n“The 5G helmet works by gathering a range of data such as that from connected cars, infrastructure and road cameras to provide real-time safety information and alerts to the rider,” he said.\nIt’s still in its testing phase but the vision, he said, is a world where everyone is integrated into the street traffic system so that data from devices, cars and bikes can then be fed into the traffic system to make changes to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion and make the roads safer.\nAnother example, he said, is where it could be used with emergency services.\n“In an emergency, you need connectivity at that point in time, you can’t wait. If ambulance staff can do diagnostics at the scene, and the data is fed directly into the emergency department at the hospital, not only will the patient get treated more quickly, it could save huge amounts of waiting time for other patients and ultimately save lives. It all comes down to data, connectivity and prioritizing, and knowing how to use it.”\n5G is making significant advances, but we still have a way to go, he said. It will probably require 6G to fully connect a city with the billions of devices, the specifications of which are still being developed, and AI will play a larger role. International standards are vital for it all to work.\n“IEC is a key part of the standards ecosystem for the technology we have now and will be a significant provider of standards and conformity assessment to help 6G become a reality.”\nIEC develops globally used standards that support this technology. Its technical committee IEC TC 106 develops safety testing standards for mobile devices, base stations and wireless communications systems. In addition, IEC has committees that develop standards for AI, the Internet of Things, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), as well as many more for electronic components such as USB plugs and chargers, and switches."

        "abstract": "In response to the growing threat of ransomware attacks, organizations are implementing robust information security management systems to build resilience and mitigate the impact of these attacks.",
        "content": "France’s national museum network has fallen victim to a cyber-attack, with criminals encrypting sensitive financial data and demanding a ransom to prevent its release. The Grand Palais, a venue for the Olympic Games in Paris, is one of around 40 museums affected.\nWhile it is unclear how much exactly the cyber-criminals are demanding, the ransom is unlikely to be cheap. According to the Embroker Cyber Index Report, ransomware attacks are becoming both more expensive and more frequent. The report says that in just one year the average ransom fee has shot up by more than 500% from $400 000 to $2 million. Skyrocket. That is without factoring in lost income while criminals hold IT systems to ransom. Embroker estimates that in 2023 the average length of system downtime after a ransomware attack was equivalent to 17 business days.\nIn response to this growing threat, many organizations are implementing robust information security management systems to build resilience and mitigate the impact of these attacks. The most trusted framework for IT systems is ISO/IEC 27001, a globally recognized standard for information security management.\nImplementing ISO/IEC 27001 provides a systematic approach to information security management. It helps organizations to establish a culture of security and minimize the risk of ransomware attacks.\nISO/IEC 27001 includes a framework of policies, procedures, and controls for managing risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It provides a comprehensive set of controls that can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization and includes a risk management approach that can help organizations identify and prioritize their information security risks.\nISO/IEC 27001 includes both technical and non-technical controls. Technical controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls, help to prevent unauthorized access to networks and data.\nAccording to a report by Informed Sauce, more than 90% of breaches are due to poor patch management. Because it is a critical component of a comprehensive security strategy ISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to establish a robust patch management process to ensure that vulnerabilities associated with missing patches are identified and addressed in a timely manner. \nBut a comprehensive security approach involves not only implementing the right technology and processes but also ensuring that people understand their roles and responsibilities in preventing cyber security incidents. Indeed, employees are often the weakest link in cyber security.\nAccording to a report by Barracuda, nearly 70% of organizations surveyed revealed that their ransomware attack started with a phishing email -- a fraudulent message designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. \nISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to establish information security policies and procedures, including those related to raising the awareness of employees. This could, for example, include training on how to recognize and avoid phishing emails and other social engineering tactics.\nISO/IEC 27001 also advises organizations to review and improve their ISMS regularly to adjust their defences against continuously evolving cyber threats, including ransomware attacks. IECQ conformity assessment can provide added assurance.\nISO/IEC 27001 is now part of an approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of compliance.\nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that all the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met."

In most countries, the energy consumption measured by the meter forms the basis for energy suppliers to generate a bill for consumers to pay for their usage.\nIn some countries, payment meters are used that provide consumer with the ability to pay for their energy consumption at the meter. Payment meters have the facility to accept credit by means of a token (e.g., smart card, key, or over the air). They measure the energy usage and, through the use of in-built tariff data, deduct the charge from the available credit. \nPayment meters are fitted with a supply control switch that cuts off the supply when the available credit has been exhausted. The supply is restored when more credit is added. Features such as Emergency Credit allow consumers to restore their supply if they cannot, for some reason, manage to top up their credit.\nSmart meters often have the facility to be configured as payment meters, providing the ability to be topped up remotely over the air in real time, which can be more convenient for consumers.\n\nThe 2022 edition of IEC 62055-31 defines the functional requirements that apply to payment meters, including basic informative requirements as well as test methods for some operations, while also providing flexibility for the wide range of options available on the market. IEC 62055-31 has been designed to align with the requirements of IEC 62052-31 which specifies product safety requirements for equipment for electrical energy measurement and control.\nThe international standard is the work of IEC Technical Committee 13: Electrical energy measurement and control."

        "content": "The restriction on the use of PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) is gaining traction worldwide. The United States, the European Union and other countries have begun discussing regulations.\nWhat is PFAS and why does it need regulation?\nDr. Miyuki Takenaka, Chair of IEC Technical Committee 111 explained that \"PFAS are a group of synthetic organofluorine chemical compounds resistant to water, oil, heat and to chemicals. It has been widely used as a water repellent, a surface treatment agent, an emulsifier, a fire extinguishing agent, a coating agent, etc. While these properties are useful in products, many countries are considering regulations because of the chemical compounds’ persistent nature in our environment.”\nThe challenge\nDeveloping adequate and effective test methodologies is a challenge. The Working Group 3 in TC 111 develops test methods for certain substances to help comply with the global regulations such as Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS). \nDr. Takenaka explained the issue further, “Since there are thousands of PFAS compounds, it is difficult to quantify all these components individually, and there are major technical challenges for the measurement. All over the world, providing testing methods for PFAS is desired.”\nA dedicated PFAS workshop to find solutions                                                             \nTo meet this demand, IEC TC 111/WG 3 held a workshop dedicated to PFAS at IEC Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (IEC-APRC) in Singapore in May. Speakers included leaders in the fields of industry and representatives from the ISO, ASTM and CEN as well as experts driving the standards. Each speaker introduced the challenges of PFAS measurement based on their experiences indicating the importances of comprehensive countermeasures such as collecting and evaluating the latest scientific knowledge and the detection status in the products. Everyone on the panel agreed that it is critical to take measures as efficiently as possible, such as rationally prioritizing a large number of substances.\nIEC President, Jo Cops, also attended the workshop and sent a congratulatory message to the participants. Mr. Cops mentioned that one of the main strategies of IEC is fostering a sustainable world, and TC 111 has a crucial role to play in contributing to the realization of sustainability through its various initiatives for environmental standardization.\nDr. Jaehak Jung, Co-Convener of the working group concluded that the IEC/TC 111/WG 3 will soon launch this important work around PFAS by collaborating with many stakeholders across the world.\nIn addition to testing methods for chemical substances, the IEC/TC 111 provides guidance and standards on issues such as ecodesign (considering life cycles), ecodesign for material circularity, reused components, information exchange about materials, chemical, and circularity, Product Category Rule (PCR), greenhouse gas, e-waste management, recyclability and EOL(end-of-life) information through the life cycle of products and services.\n \nYou can watch the replay of the PFAS workshop here."

        "published_day": "2024-08-02",
        "abstract": "The new IEC report on semantic interoperability explores its crucial relevance in emerging technologies in our increasingly connected world, and how standardization is helping.",
        "content": "In today’s world, there is a rapid increase in digital connectivity across almost every aspect of our lives. Technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) are making way for smarter homes, factories and cities, that can thrive on connected systems running various functions easily and effectively.  \nConnected machines, though need a common language to understand each other and ensure seamless interaction.\nAn absence of a standardized method for transposing information into digital artifacts often leads to inconsistencies.\nThe need for semantic interoperability\nThe new IEC Report on semantic interoperability compares this gap to historical times when different villages within a country might have had their own languages.  This would have limited trade and economic growth until common regional languages and translation emerged.\nThe same principle applies to machines. Machines need to be able to communicate concepts across various connected regions. This is a difficult task, as the same concept can be described differently in different parts of the world, or even by different people feeding data differently into the systems. For the connected system to function effectively, the machines need to be able to understand the concepts behind the descriptive data, to efficiently classify, interpret or leverage that information. This requires increased interoperability in terms of concepts, data structures, information models as well as digital specifications.\nThe solution is semantic interoperability which helps define the meaning of data. It provides the means for two systems to understand each other’s conventions and functions behind the data and the context in which it is used.\nSemantic interoperability will be the key to digitalization and the latest industrial revolution connecting the world.\nHighlights of the report\nThe main objective of this report by IEC is to resolve the lack of a single standardized way of expressing information in digital artifacts. It explores the importance of semantic interoperability in ensuring that information exchanged is readily understood by computer systems and their associated software on both ends of the ICT communication channel.\nThe authors also explore examples of different domains where semantic interoperability is key. For instance, the IEC Common Data Dictionary (IEC CDD) is a metadata registry providing product classification and formalized product descriptions that can be used in the context of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 as well as in many other domains.\nSimilarly semantic interoperability is at the heart of Smart standards, the future digital representations of standard publications.  Smart signifies the transformation of document-centric data into digitally enabled standards that are machine-applicable, readable and transferable (Smart).\n A Smart standard may be composed of many different elements such as “scope”, “term”, “requirement”, “recommendation”, “permission”, “example”, “note”, etc. Offering access to Smart standards or exchanging standards between organizations assumes that the machine will be able to discriminate correctly a “scope” from a “provision”, or a “requirement” from a “recommendation” – an area where semantic interoperability will be crucial. The next stage of semantic interoperability will also be extending machine understanding related to the content itself.\nThe new IEC report acts on the discussions and recommendations formulated in the 2019 IEC White Paper Semantic interoperability: challenges in the digital transformation age.\nThe report explains the vital role of standardization in supporting the creation of international semantic conventions. It highlights gaps in international standards and makes recommendations.\nThe report was developed by a task force dedicated to semantic interoperability operating within the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB).\nDownload the report here."

        "published_day": "2024-07-31",
        "abstract": "A lack of awareness about the cyber security needs of operational technology is putting critcal infrastructure at risk.",
        "content": "The US Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent, nonpartisan federal agency, has highlighted a lack of OT (operational technology) skills in the country’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. GAO called for improvements in addressing risks to OT, noting that malicious cyber actors pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure, such as electricity, water and healthcare. \nThe GAO’s concerns are neither new nor restricted to the US. A few years ago, an IEC technology report similarly warned that cyber security was too often understood only in terms of IT. According to the report, those responsible for security frequently overlook the operational constraints in critical infrastructure. \nWe find ourselves in this situation because the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has accelerated the emergence of cyber-physical systems, where the once separate domains of IT and OT converge. Sensors and monitors connected to OT gather, analyze and communicate data with other online devices and systems to improve quality, efficiency and safety.\nFurthermore, OT environments have to cope with different kinds of risk. In the cyber-physical world, everything is geared towards the physical movement and control of devices and processes to keep systems working as intended. For example, OT helps ensure that a generator comes online when there is an increase in electricity demand, or that an overflow valve opens when a chemical tank is full, in order to avoid hazardous substances spilling. Moreover, cyber-attacks on IT and OT systems tend to have different consequences. Cyber attacks on IT have almost exclusively economic effects, while cyber attacks on critical infrastructure can impact the environment, damage equipment, or even threaten public health and lives.\nIn OT environments, industrial automation and control systems (IACS) run in a loop to check continually that everything is functioning correctly. These systems include the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology and human-machine interfaces (HMI) that are at the very heart of cyber-physical systems. From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that IACSs are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. \nProtecting SCADA systems\nProtecting SCADA systems, which are used to oversee electric grids, as well as machinery in industrial installations, often relies on “security by obscurity”, which reflects an ingrained mindset that since no one knows or cares about their communications systems or their data, they do not need to protect it. However, SCADA systems can now have widespread communication networks increasingly reaching directly or indirectly into thousands of facilities, with increasing threats (both deliberate and inadvertent) potentially causing serious harm.\nCyber-attacks on OT systems\nCritical infrastructure has been targeted on a number of occasions. Probably the best-known incident was in Ukraine in 2015 when hackers successfully infiltrated the electric utility’s SCADA system. Key circuit breakers were tripped, and the SCADA system became unusable, causing a system-wide power blackout. It left nearly a quarter of a million people without electricity, in the middle of winter, for up to six hours.\nIn October 2019, reports from India confirmed that hackers had infiltrated the country’s biggest nuclear power station, at Kudankulam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. According to the virus scanning website VirusTotal, the hackers had managed to infect at least one computer with malware before the breach was detected.\nIn 2020, a series of cyber-attacks targeted Israeli water systems, including pumping stations, sewer systems and wastewater plants. Cyber terrorists reportedly exploited vulnerabilities in outdated ICS to gain access. Fortunately, the attacks failed to disrupt the water supply but it is believed the hackers were attempting to increase chemicals such as chlorine in the water to harmful levels.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges based on global best practices. For example, IEC 62443, is designed to keep OT systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.  \nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nIn an ideal world, power stations and other critical infrastructure would be secure-by -design. Trying to patch on security after the fact can at best be only a quick fix and at worst comes too late to prevent harm. In addition to security standards for key communication protocols, IEC 62351 provides guidance on designing security into systems and operations before building them, rather than applying security measures after the systems have been implemented. For the countless legacy systems still in use, the standard provides practical advice on managing transitions to security-based designs, including countermeasures in all system retrofits and upgrades."

Despite the sophistication of the malware, it turned out to be the work of three teenagers operating from their bedrooms. \nTheir targets included the website of security journalist Brian Krebs and the DNS provider Dyn, which disrupted internet access across the United States. Mirai and its variants have also wreaked havoc in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. \nToday, DDoS attacks are increasing in number as hackers adapt their strategies to neutralize commonly used countermeasures and mitigation techniques. There is evidence that cyber threat actors are becoming more creative as IT administrators grow used to dealing with one of the most common types of cyber-attack.\nAs the IoT continues to expand, encompassing everything from smart home devices to industrial machinery, ensuring the safety of people, systems and data transmission channels is essential. International standards provide a universal framework for IoT security.\nFor instance, ISO/IEC 30141 offers a standardized IoT Reference Architecture, aimed at creating safer and more resilient connected systems. This framework helps IoT application designers and developers build secure, privacy-friendly systems. It emphasizes functional requirements, like data and device management, as well as non-functional requirements, such as maintainability, reliability and scalability.\nISO/IEC 27400 and ISO/IEC 27402 provide guidelines and baseline requirements for IoT security and privacy. The development of sector-specific architectures, as outlined in ISO/IEC 30149, further enhances the trustworthiness of IoT systems and services. \nStandards like ISO/IEC 30165 and  ISO/IEC 21823 address real-time capabilities and interoperability challenges to ensure that IoT systems can operate securely, even in complex, large-scale environments.\nThe integration of industrial automation and control systems (IACS) into the industrial internet of things (IIoT) poses cyber security challenges for critical infrastructure, such as the electricity grid, water management systems and manufacturing plants. Standards like IEC 62443 are designed to address these challenges by providing guidelines for securing IACS and ensuring their safe and reliable operation in the context of IIoT.\nIECEE conformity assessment ensures the correct implementation of IEC 62443. IECEE also provides certification to ETSI EN 303 645 for consumer IoT cyber security. IoT products included in its scope include connected children’s toys and baby monitors, connected safety products such as smoke detectors, smart cameras, TVs and speakers, wearable health trackers, connected appliances and more.\nThe Mirai incident serves as a stark reminder of cyber security vulnerabilities in an increasingly connected world. It is a world where most of those who carry out the attacks need only limited IT skills, instead relying on developers like the Mirai creators to make malicious code available for purchase or free download.   \n \nSee also\nEssential IoT standard gets a second edition"

        "abstract": "A joint IEC and ISO committee is about to publish a much awaited second edition of ISO/IEC 30141, a foundational standard which defines the global architecture of the Internet of Things (IoT).",
        "content": "When the first edition of ISO/IEC 30141 was published in 2018, both IEC and ISO knew that they were paving the way for technologies related to the IOT to be used across many different areas, from the industrial IoT to automotive and consumer applications. As the Chair of the Committee François Coallier explained at the time, “One of the challenges we faced was that the market for the IoT was growing and evolving rapidly, thanks to ever more powerful computer systems and the lowering of sensor prices and other devices, but technologies were still immature in many respects. We had to keep track of all these developments and reach a global consensus before publishing.” \nBut he also acknowledged that the document would have to be regularly updated as the technologies in the IoT space were rapidly evolving. “We left many points out for the revision work which had already started, even at the time we published. We knew it was imperative to continuously update this crucial document to keep up with the rapidly changing technological landscape.”\nFrom single architecture to patterns\nThe much awaited second edition of this foundational standard is now about to be published. \nAccording to the experts who worked on the document, the new standard is based on the concept of patterns, instead of one all-encompassing architecture, making it more adaptable and flexible to the evolving IoT environment. It is a comprehensive revision, which took into account more than 1500 editorial comments from National Committees.\n“The technological environment for the IoT is changing rapidly. Systems are becoming more complex, and their architectures are more diverse. Edition 1 was trying to capture the diversity of IoT architectures with a single model and is therefore monolithic in its approach. Edition 2 supports the diversity of modern architectures, enabling a system architect to better leverage existing knowledge when building new systems,” explains Torbjörn Lahrin, who was the main project editor. \nAccording to the experts, who are also working on a technical report to explain how to use the standard, “Patterns can be understood as reusable solutions to a particular problem. They reflect the knowledge gained from past experience and allow this expertise to be effectively leveraged for new designs.” By providing a set of patterns that can easily be composed into different architectures, the second edition of ISO/IEC 30141 makes it easy to leverage existing knowledge to solve new and future system design problems.\nAntonio Kung was one of the main experts working on the new edition. “Some of the examples of patterns in Edition 2 are enterprise pattern, IoT component capability pattern and digital twin pattern,” he lists.\nA new edition is already on the cards. “ISO/ IEC 30141 [edition] three is under development. The major structure will remain unchanged, while a pattern repository will be added. We are also putting in place a structure for adding new patterns in a short cycle, without the need to update the standard each time,” says Eric Simmon, who was one of the leading experts on the project. This will allow the standard to keep up with the fast pace of new developments in the IoT space."

        "content": "Wind turbines are often criticized for the amount of acoustic noise they make, and the IEC helps by providing the benchmarks by which to measure it.\nBut labs applying these benchmarks need to be properly assessed as well. That’s where the work of MEASNET (International Network of Wind Energy Measurement Institutes) comes in. This non-profit organization, comprising the most experienced wind energy institutes from around the world, aims to work out rules and requirements which will guarantee that high quality comparable measurements are made by its members.\nThe non-profit, which is a member of IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, has assessed the work of 16 technical labs involved in wind turbine acoustic noise measurement.\nAfter releasing the first public report on power performance proficiency testing last March (see interview in e-tech), it continues its policy of transparency by publicly sharing the acoustic noise proficiency test report free of charge. The report has been coordinated by Bo Søndengaard, former member of Sweco Denmark. \n\n“This new report constitutes a comprehensive overview of acoustic noise evaluation that would not have been possible without honest communication between the different laboratories involved”, says Alejandro Martinez, MEASNET Vice Chairman and Technical Advisor for Proficiency Tests, as well as IECRE Lead Assessor.\n\nThe report can be freely downloaded from the MEASNET website."

        "content": "IEC and ISO international standards reflect the wisdom of a broad and diverse range of experts from every corner of the world. They codify the global best practices that could have helped prevent the recent IT outage that is still affecting hospitals, airports, banks and other businesses worldwide.\nAnalysts blame the absence of three safeguards for exacerbating the impact of the faulty software: rigorous testing, enhanced monitoring and effective communication. IEC and ISO cyber security standards address all three.\nISO/IEC 27002, for instance, provides comprehensive guidelines for information security controls, including those related to change management and software updates. Another standard, ISO/IEC 27017, builds on ISO/IEC 27002 to provide additional security guidance for the cloud.\nIt emphasizes the importance of a formal change management process, including thorough planning, risk assessment and approval of changes before implementation.\nThe ISO/IEC Standard recommends sandboxing: extensive testing in a controlled environment to detect any potential issues. It is easy to see how this step is crucial to prevent untested updates from causing widespread disruptions.\nISO/IEC 27002 further recommends continuous monitoring and review of systems post-update to help address any bugs quickly. It also emphasizes the vital importance of documentation of the update process and clear communication with stakeholders.\nThis step ensures that everyone is aware of the changes and can respond appropriately when things go pear shaped.\nOn the user end, for example, many of the affected organizations could have recovered more swiftly if they had implemented the standard. Among other things, it advises maintaining up-to-date backups and developing a recovery plan.\nBack-ups and a recovery plan ensure that systems can be quickly restored to a previous stable state in case of an update failure. Implementing best practices would have allowed affected organizations to recover more swiftly from the incident.\nSo what is ISO/IEC 27002?\nISO/IEC 27002 supports and builds on the countermeasures set out in the world’s best-known cyber security standard for IT, ISO/IEC 27001. It is designed to enable organizations of all types and sizes to manage their IT risks effectively.\nISO/IEC 27002 describes dozens of information security controls with guidelines for implementing them. In common with other IEC and ISO cyber security standards, it takes a risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology.\nCentral to this is the notion that trying to protect everything in equal measure is neither efficient nor sustainable. It is therefore important to identify and focus resources on securing the most valuable assets that ensure business continuity.\nConformity assessment\nIndependent, third-party certification is equally essential, in addition to the internal audits at planned intervals recommended in ISO/IEC 27001.\nThis standard is part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications. The aim is to provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met in full.\nMany are referring to the global IT outage as the worst cyber event in history. Microsoft estimates that over eight million computers around the world were disabled.\n \nDisclaimer: views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the IEC."

        "published_day": "2024-07-19",
        "abstract": "Experts differentiate between ‘strong’ and ‘narrow’ AI.",
        "content": "Nearly one in five Americans believe that artificial intelligence is already sentient, while a further 30% think AI systems have human-like intelligence. That is according to a recent survey by the Sentience Institute, a North American think tank.\nSentient AI has been a staple of mainstream culture for more than half a century. Popular movies featuring self-aware AI include such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Ex Machina and Her.\nThe truth is that what we know as AI relies on algorithms and data and is devoid of any consciousness or understanding of its own actions. That does not mean, however, that all AI is the same.\nExperts differentiate between ‘strong’ and ‘narrow’ AI. Strong AI, also called artificial general intelligence (AGI), refers to a hypothetical future machine able to solve any problem requiring advanced cognitive abilities. \nSuch a machine would be able to cope with new situations and solve problems not encountered previously. In other words, it would be able to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, just like people.\nNeither the humanoid robots on display at the ITU’s recent AI for Good conference nor any of the other machines feted in the media possess this kind of AI. They have narrow AI, which can only support humans in solving problems in very specific use cases.\nAlphaGo, for instance, thrashed the human world champion of the board game Go, but would be useless at web searches or operating smart devices. For these tasks and much else besides,virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri combine different narrow AIs to create a kind of hybrid intelligence.\nThey do not have AGI and neither do Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, which are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human language. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as translation, summarizing and conversation.\nIn terms of how AI is transforming our lives, virtual assistants and LLMs are the tip of the iceberg. ISO/IEC experts have identified over 180 use cases.\nAI is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling early disease detection and personalized treatment plans. It enhances productivity across industries through automation and data analysis, as well as driving innovations in education and environmental conservation.\nAll of these benefits do not come without challenges. While the jury is still out on when and if self-aware and smart-as-humans AI will happen, there are more pressing concerns around issues like bias and fairness, privacy, security, lack of transparency and ethics.\nThese challenges highlight the important role of international, consensus-based standards in ensuring that AI is developed and used responsibly. \nSC 42, the joint IEC and ISO committee, develops international, consensus-based standards for AI. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, covering both technology capability, such as data quality, and non-technical requirements, including business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs and ethical and societal concerns.\nISO/IEC 42001, for instance, is an international standard for managing AI systems, ensuring ethical practices, transparency and continuous improvement, which is crucial for balancing innovation with responsible AI development. Adding an additional layer of assurance, the international standard is designed to facilitate certification.\nCurrently participating in the work of SC 42 are around 800 experts from 64 countries, more than a third of which are considered developing countries. The aim is to ensure that everyone has a voice in the process and no one is left behind.\nIt is not only engineers and data scientists who contribute to ISO/IEC AI standards. The broad and diverse range of stakeholders in SC 42 include ethicists, experts from the regulatory and policy world, as well as from legal, educational and research environments.\nIf you would like to find out more, SC 42 organizes free workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight."

        "content": "Halogens appear everywhere in nature. The element group classifying chemicals like chlorine, fluorine or bromine are known as halogens. They are also essential for human life; for example, chlorine is needed in processes linked to building (anabolism) and breaking down (catabolism) body tissues. \nBut even beyond that, due to their unique performance properties, relative low cost and abundance, modern use of halogens in the world around us is extensive. They are needed for use in swimming pools (chlorine and bromine), drinking water (chlorine and fluorine), toothpaste (fluorine) as well as in table salt (chlorine). Halogens are also widely used in electrical and electronic products. \nManaging risk\nDespite their several benefits, there are risks associated. If halogen compounds catch fire, they release corrosive and toxic gases which become an environmental and health risk.  In addition, the wide use of halogen compounds in several consumer products has the potential to create toxic wastes, in particular in countries where the disposal of products containing halogens is not well managed.\nRegulators and legislators are keen to tackle this problem. Experts from organizations like the IEC are developing standards for the determination, quantification and possible limitation of halogen content in materials and products.\nHowever, there is often a lack of consistency, in the different terms used to express similar halogen content such as halogen free, non-halogenated, zero halogen and low halogen. Different limits for halogens are sometimes used when employing the same term and, sometimes, similar terms are used when referring to different halogen types.\nThis makes it harder for regulators to manage safe levels of halogen use, and for the consumer to know if they are within safe limits of exposure.\nA new guide for experts and policymakers\nACEA, the Advisory Committee for Environmental Action, that advises IEC’s technical committees on environmental considerations, has developed a new guide to help standard writers and policymakers get on the same page.  The IEC Guide for defining halogen content terminology in IEC Standards, will bring clarity on terminology in the use of halogen and address the issues that cause variations.\nIf you wish to learn more about how the new IEC Guide  and the impact it can have for regulating halogen risks, join the IEC webinar on the role of standards in defining halogenated materials, on 9 September.\n \n \nFind out more:\nHalogens : A new guide for understanding use in an environmentally conscious market"

        "content": "Lights are taken for granted but they are essential to our everyday comfort and safety. Imagine if the streets were still lit with gaslights and that we still used candle sticks to see in our homes at night. While people in developed nations are used to switching lights on and off, many countries in the world still do not have access to electricity from the grid and either use dangerous and polluting kerosene lamps or have access to light powered by a solar panel which works off-grid.\nThe IEC prepares standards that enable us to use lights safely and efficiently – whether on or off-grid.\nNew edition of a foundational standard\nLighting might be taken for granted in developed economies, but it can still cause accidents if not used safely or installed in a way the meets the strictest safety requirements. The most prolific technical committee in the IEC, IEC TC 34, is about to publish the tenth edition of one of its foundational standards, IEC 60598-1. This standard specifies general safety requirements for luminaires which work with supply voltages up to 1000 V. The standard is very regularly updated to take into account improvements in safety relating to state- of-the-art technology. These improvements are incorporated with revisions and amendments on an ongoing basis.\nThis standard is aimed at the lighting industries for the correct design of luminaires, but also at test houses for certification and at market surveillance authorities to verify the safety of products on the market. \nIEC TC 34 is the leading IEC TC on lighting standards. The committee has published more than 600 documents relating to lighting technology It has established four subcommittees (SCs) to address the various areas and the wide range of applications relating to the lighting industry.\nStandards for off-grid lighting\n IEC TC 82 publishes a series of technical specifications (TS) which make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. The standards series has been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).\nThey include IEC TS 62257-9-8, which sets the baseline requirements for the quality, durability and accuracy for stand-alone renewable energy products, with the aim of protecting consumers. The evaluation of these requirements uses the test methods defined in IEC TS 62257-9-5. All of them are based on the Quality Assurance Framework and Quality Standards established by Lighting Global (World Bank) to rapidly increase access to off-grid solar energy for the hundreds of millions of people living without electricity worldwide. This enables these millions of people to have access to safe lighting, notably."

        "content": "Vertical farming is a sustainable farming concept that has received much hype. Transforming dilapidated warehouses and factories into urban farms to grow salads and vegetables has generated much interest, most notably in Japan and the United States.\nAccording to the research company Statista, the vertical farming market was worth USD 5,6 billion in 2022 and is expected to increase to over USD 35 billion by 2032.\nBut indoor farming is not a new concept, as greenhouses have long demonstrated. It has existed since Roman times and can be found in various parts of the world. In modern times they have enabled the Netherlands to become the world’s second largest food exporter.\nAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, food production worldwide will need to increase by 70% by 2050 to feed a projected global population of 9,1 billion. Indoor farms could be one possible solution to feeding large populations, and specifically populations concentrated in urban centres.\nTechnology is increasingly applied in farming. With indoor farming for example, produce is grown in a controlled environment where elements including light, humidity, and temperature are carefully monitored. The intensity and frequency of the LED lights can be adjusted according to the needs of the plant. Sensors and cameras can collect data with detailed information about the plants which can then be analyzed to improve plant health, growth and yield.\nAccording to one ‘high-tech’ greenhouse in the United States, it can achieve yields up to 350 times greater than from open fields but using just one percent of the water traditional techniques require.\nLet there be light\nLight is essential for the growth of plants. Using the energy from light, plants can convert it to their own energy source through photosynthesis. In a greenhouse, modern lighting can be used to help maximize plant growth.\nAccording to an article by Kevin M. Folta, professor at the University of Florida Horticultural Sciences Department, “Light is not just the stuff that plants need to grow. Light is actually a mixture of information that can guide plant growth, development and productivity”. Altering the variables of light parameters (wavelength, fluence rate and photoperiod) can impact plant biology and production. Researchers are looking at how these parameters can be modified at various times in the plant lifecycle to maximize plant production in a protected environment.\nLight-emitting diode (LED) lighting is growing in popularity for use in greenhouses. According to a paper by researchers from the Hannover Centre for Optical Technologies, the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost of vegetables due to the LEDs’ high energy efficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity. The paper states that, “using LEDs as a lighting source, it is possible not only to optimize the spectral quality for various plants and different physiological processes, but also to create a digitally controlled and energy efficient lighting system”.\nIEC Standards….\nThe IEC is actively involved in the standardization of lights to ensure their safety, quality and performance. \nIEC TC 34 has produced over 550 publications, developed with nearly 300 experts from 34 participating countries. Standards range from IEC 60598-1 on general requirements and tests for luminaries to IEC 62386-304 on digital addressable lighting interfaces.\nIEC 60598-2-2, Particular requirements - Recessed luminaires and recessed air-handling luminaires and IEC 62722-2-1, Particular requirements - LED luminaires are now also available as Commented Versions or CMVs. These publications include extensive technical commentary by experts who worked on the standard, clarifiying and explaining the main changes between the previous and current edition.\n… and conformity assessment\nLighting systems rely on standards to ensure safety, performance and quality. With the mass production of LED lights, however, fears have emerged regarding their quality and reliability.\nOne faulty component can result in poor performance or even the overall failure of the LED lighting system. All electronic components, parts, modules and assemblies must work satisfactorily together\nThe IEC has developed the IECQ scheme for LED that certifies manufacturers and suppliers of electronic components and assemblies used in the production of LED lighting systems.\nThis scheme provides manufacturers with the confidence that the products they sell or purchase have been independently verified and comply with the requirements of the relevant technical standards and specifications."

Or an online tool to estimate property prices that got it so wrong it resulted in a real estate marketplace losing over USD300 million.\nThese are just some of the real-world examples of how poor-quality data fed into AI systems can have disastrous consequences. Not only does poor data produce poor results, it can also cause hallucinations in AI, where the model simply makes things up.\nErrors like this are few but demonstrate the need for ensuring that data fed into AI models is of the highest possible quality, thus enabling it to continue to contribute positively to society in so many ways. But how?\nOne way to improve data quality is through a data quality management system. By providing guidance and processes for continually improving the quality of data it helps to ensure that the data being used is appropriate. It also outlines ways of measuring quality as well as enabling auditing and good governance.\n\"Data quality is at the heart of AI systems\", said Wael William Diab, who chairs the ISO/IEC committee for AI, SC 42. \"Ensuring a high metric of quality is essential to enabling broad responsible AI\".\nMany organizations have data quality processes in place already, but machine learning models in AI have specific requirements. For this reason, SC 42 has recently put together a series of international standards that address data quality from every angle. It offers requirements and guidelines for improving data quality for AI and the associated analytics.\nThe ISO/IEC 5259 series provides a data quality model, ways of measuring data quality, definitions of what data quality is and examples and use cases. This includes elements such as how well the data quality characteristics, aspects that tend to be problematic and life-cycle specific data quality management.\nIt also covers governance of data quality, to help organizations have the proper controls in place to track the sources and uses of data and address issues around responsibility and transparency. This will then help to build trust in AI systems and reduce errors even further.\nSome of the parts in the series have just been published, with the others likely to follow suit in the coming months.\nLearn more about the working group who are developing the series in this short video."

        "published_day": "2024-07-03",
        "abstract": "Examples from two technical committees highlight how gender differences are being tested and used to set differentiated requirements in IEC Standards.",
        "content": "For several years now the IEC has been asking its technical committees to ensure that their standards are gender responsive so that they can meet the safety requirements of the whole population, not only men. \nIn a recent webinar organized by the IEC Academy, concrete examples of how this is being done were given, showing how important gender considerations are and how easy to ignore when little or no awareness of gender differences exists. Examples included safety for household and commercial appliance standards and publications specifying the testing of electromagnetic waves on the human body.\nInput from the Standardization Management Board\nThe webinar was kicked off by IEC Deputy Secretary-General and Secretary of the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) Gilles Thonet. He explained how critical the topic of gender responsive standards (GRS) is for the IEC. “Our strategy is based on three pillars, one of which is trust, inclusion and collaboration. Inclusion means that IEC Standards must accommodate the needs of everyone, not only one part of the population,” he said.\nHe reminded the audience that the IEC and ISO has formed a joint advisory strategic group (JSAG) on GRS which produced a guidance document and an assessment form, which had recently been simplified, to help experts from TCs on GRS. He also added that the mandate of the JSAG had been extended for the next two years and that the group had been notably tasked to produce a guide for GRS, which as opposed to guidance, could have mandatory aspects for the writing of standards.\nHe mentioned that an administrative circular will be sent to all TC experts inviting them to attend an IEC Academy training webinar on the guidance document and GRS, which has been available online since 2023.\nMichelle Parkouda, Manager of Research for the Standards Council of Canada and a co-convenor for the JSAG on GRS, explained that while technology is considered neutral, its impact is not. “We should start with the assumption that there are gender differences. This is very different from saying prove to me that there are gender differences. What we are saying is prove to me that there are no gender differences,” she said.\nConcrete examples speak better: household and commercial appliances\nRandi Myers, the Director of Standards Programs at UL Standards and Engagement and Secretary of IEC TC 61, which prepare safety standards for household and commercial appliances, gave several concrete examples of how her TC was evaluating the impact of gender and including gender differences in standards. “We have a number of use case where gender differences are being assessed and this includes physical strength, physical anatomy and voice recognition for the remote control of appliances,” she explained. She cited the example of IEC 60035-1, which establishes a base set of requirements for the safety of household and commercial appliances and where gender aspects can be set as default requirements that can be applied to all TC 61 standards. She gave the example of test probes in IEC 60035-1 which are routinely used to test electronic parts of household equipment. “Test probe requirements never considered the anatomical differences between men and women and we now are trying to ensure they do,” she said.\nAnother example was applying the concept of minimum strength to IEC 60035-2-14 for kitchen appliances. “We looked at the minimum strength needed for opening pressure cookers,” she added. She explained that research was required to change the requirements, using tests carried on ten women and ten men. “These tests spoke volumes about the differences between genders and they were crucial. Without the data they provided we would not be changing the standard,” she insisted.\nConcrete examples speak better: testing the absorption of electromagnetic (EM) waves by the human body\nMike Wood, TC 106 expert (and previous Chair!) as well as responsible for Telstra’s Electromagnetic Energy (EME) Strategy, Governance and Risk Management program, highlighted how the testing was conducted in TC 106. “We use computational models for testing and these take into account all the different shapes and sizes of diverse human groups, including women and pregnant women, as well older and younger people,” he explained. Limits for the exposure to EM waves are set by international and national health bodies and TC 106 tests the devices to see if they comply with these limits. The committee looks at the specific absorption rate (SAR) of EM waves by different groups of people, i.e. how much energy is absorbed by their body. “The requirements have grown in recent years with the advent of electric vehicles and wireless charging,” he added. To build the computational models, they took MRIs and tissue types of 300 healthy volunteers of different populations both male and female. The TC 106 standard specifying SAR on a global level is IEC /IEEE 62704-1, but other important standards where gender will play a role are IEC /IEEE 62704-2 which measures SAR from vehicle mounted antennas and the IEC publicly available specification 63184-1 which tests electric and magnetic fields for wireless power transfer.\nIn conclusion, all participants agreed that including more women in technical committees, which was being actively encouraged by IEC management, was a key factor in advancing the issue of GRS."

        "content": "He was almost called Lord Cable, having been instrumental in the first transatlantic telegraph cable which paved the way for international telecommunications.\nInstead, he was named Lord Kelvin, a name that now lives on as the Kelvin scale for absolute temperature, an international system that he invented. Which was very apt given Sir William Thomson’s obsession with measurement, according to historian Bruce J Hunt at a recent IEC webinar to celebrate 200 years since Kelvin was born.\n“In the 1850s, when the telegraph industry was just getting going, Lord Kelvin was very frustrated by the fact that they had no units to measure things, the methods they used were based on comparing,” he said.\n“So when the first attempt to lay a transatlantic cable failed, he pointed out that standard ways of measuring and undertaking quality control were needed. He later founded what became the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards that laid the foundation for the whole system of ohms, amps and volts we use today.”\nLord Kelvin’s contributions to science and engineering are far reaching, being a pioneer of concepts such as thermodynamics and magnetism and his work was fundamental in the development of today's electrical units and standards. You could say he was the one who turned on the lights. He was also a pioneer of international standardization and it was for this and many other reasons that he was elected the first IEC President in 1906.\nAs one of the earliest champions of renewable energy, particularly wind power, Kelvin’s early ideas planted the seeds for what is now one of the most important sources of electricity today. The wind industry has evolved dramatically, as explained by Alistair Mackinnon, Chair of the IEC Systems for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for use in Renewable Energy Applications (IECRE).\n“In the ‘80s wind turbines were just for the ‘beards and sandals’ type of people, they were only found onshore and the biggest ones measuring just 30m high and blades 20m long,” he said.\n“These days it is a multi-billion dollar industry, with the biggest reaching 160m high and with blades up to 120m long, and work is underway to place them far out at sea, in very deep water.”\nThese and many other facts were discussed and shared at the IEC Academy public webinar to celebrate 200 years since Kelvin was born.\nWatch the replay here."

        "published_day": "2024-06-26",
        "abstract": "Brain implant technology is making great strides - especially when it comes to the medical field. IEC Standards are paving the way.",
        "content": "According to the Guardian, a UK teenager with severe epilepsy has become the first person in the world to be fitted with a brain implant aimed at bringing epileptic seizures under control. The boy’s neurostimulator sits under the skull and sends electrical signals deep into the brain, reducing his daytime seizures by 80%.\nThe science of brain implants has progressed in leaps and bounds over the last decade. Although it was known as early as the nineteenth century that living brains have electrical activity, an Austrian psychiatrist named Hans Berger was the first to record this activity in humans, in the late 1920's. We have since discovered that the brain contains about 100 billion microscopic cells called neurons which together can generate enough electricity to power a low-wattage bulb. \nWearable brain computer interfaces \nBrain-computer interfaces have become all the rage and at CES a few years ago, a French startup founded by neuroscientists, launched a wearable device, which enabled people to switch on the television using the power of their brain. The device was designed to fit around the skull very much like a headlamp. The technology used was based on the same principle as electroencephalograms. The brain emits electrical signals and these can be read and then transformed into digital commands for compatible appliances.\nThe brain-computer interface could enable gamers, for instance, to trigger commands such as play and stop simply with their brain. One of the keys to being able to control gaming from the brain is the production of more powerful sensors that can capture electric signals better. Another facilitator is technology enabling to interpret brain data in real time. Algorithms are now sufficiently sophisticated to perform such tasks.\nThe drawback of mind-reading wearables is that the signals emitted by the brain are hindered by people’s skulls and hair which get in the way of the electric waves, stopping sensors from being as efficient as required, even if they are getting more powerful.\nBrain implants are no longer science fiction\nScientists have also been trialling brain implants. The big drawback, however, is that they are invasive as they imply some form of surgery. The BrainGate programme is a long-running multi institution research effort in the US to develop neurotechnology aimed at restoring communication, mobility and independence to people with neurogenerative diseases, limb loss or paralysis. As part of the programme, devices named Utah Arrays were implanted in the brains of several trial patients who were then able to shop online and send phone messages to friends.\nOther US companies are investing into similar technology, including one of Elon Musk’s enterprises. The focus is on developing the least invasive form of implants, requiring little or no surgery.\nIn Europe, research into brain implants is also moving forward at a rapid pace: in 2019, a young French man suffering from tetraplegia demonstrated how he could power an exoskeleton with his brain and walk. He initially trained with a computer avatar until he was ready to control the exoskeleton. The technology, which works by recording and decoding brain signals, was trialled for two years by scientists at biomedical research centre Clinatec and the University of Grenoble in France. This was also shown at CES this year.\nWhere the IEC can help\nThe IEC has set up a System Committee on Active Assisted Living (SyC AAL), which focuses on the standardization of AAL products, services and systems to enable independent living for elderly or disabled users. It also enables cross-vendor interoperability of AAL systems, services, products and components. AAL systems and products may include alarm systems, wearables and even, if they ever become ubiquitous, brain-computer interfaces.\nThe joint IEC Committee with ISO which prepares standards for information technology, ISO/IEC JTC1, recently set up a subcommittee which was specifically set up to standardize brain-computer interfaces. It cannot standardize brain implants or medical devices but should be able to look at wearable devices.\nIEC TC 47 publishes key standards for the design, use and reuse of sensors, enabling users to measure their performance, for instance. Specifically focusing on wearables, IEC TC 124 publishes standards for technologies which include patchable, ingestible and implantable materials and devices and electronic textile materials and devices. TC 62 prepares standards for medical equipment, software and systems. Its work is focusing more and more on the use of artificial intelligence in medical applications.\nOn the conformity assessment side, IECEE offers testing and certification for the safety, reliability, efficiency and overall performance of electrical equipment for medical use to IEC International Standards. In addition, IECQ enables assessment of sensor manufacturers and associated service providers to see if they comply with the agreed international standards."

        "abstract": "Nuclear power can help societies transition away from fossil fuels but safety issues have to be addressed and IEC Standards ensure they are.",
        "content": "To meet zero-emission targets, the world is expected to find ways of stepping up its clean energy production. While wind and solar energies are leading the push, experts agree that electricity grids also require stable and resilient power sources to ensure a continuous energy flow. Renewable energies generated by solar and wind power are intermittent by nature, meaning that when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow, no power is generated. Other sources of energy can compensate for their variability – and choosing an option which does not emit greenhouse gases is key – if zero emissions targets are to be met.\nOne solution is nuclear energy. Nuclear power is an energy source that does not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases and can balance the grid when solar and wind are insufficient. According to the IEA, “Nuclear energy can help make the energy sector's journey away from unabated fossil fuels faster and more secure.”\nDifferent countries, different views\nFrance, one of the countries that has much invested in nuclear power, has been leading the battle to label the energy clean, by highlighting the benefits of its zero carbon emissions and eluding the issue of nuclear waste. In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, some countries, including Germany, opted to stop investing in nuclear energy altogether. For these countries, the risks of using nuclear power outweighed the benefits.\nNuclear power's role in the energy system, therefore, tends to be country specific. IEA statistics reveal that nuclear power accounts for about 10% of global electricity generation, rising to nearly 20% in advanced economies. According to the World Nuclear Association, the US and UK generate 20% of their electricity from nuclear energy, while France, unsurprisingly, reaches as high as 70%.\nSmall modular reactors are all the rage\nDespite these plans, nuclear power plant projects face challenges such as high upfront costs, long lead times and often poor records of on-time delivery. Both the UK's Hinkley Point power station (now set for completion in 2026) and the Flaman Ville 3 project in Normandy have experienced significant delays and cost overruns.\nSmall modular reactors (SMRs) offer a potential solution, despite generating more radioactive waste than conventional nuclear plants, according to some reports. These advanced reactors have a power capacity of up to 300 million Watts of electric capacity (MWe) per unit, about one-third of traditional reactors. SMRs are more affordable, easier and faster to construct. They can even be factory-built and transported to their final location in a modular fashion.\nSeveral countries are investing heavily in SMR technologies. France is investing EUR 1 billion, and Canada has launched a CAD 30 million new SMR funding programme.\nStandards are key for safety\nSafety has always been a primary concern for nuclear power plants and past accidents like those at Chernobyl and Fukushima have only compounded these concerns. Germany closed its last remaining facility in 2023. Other countries, like Switzerland, have also decided to stop the nuclear effort.\nThat’s where the work of the IEC comes in. It cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which sets global safety standards for nuclear energy. Experts from IEC Technical Committee 45 participate in the IAEA’s technical working group on nuclear power plant instrumentation and control, advising on nuclear plant technology and human-system interfaces.\nOne of its subcommittees, SC 45A, publishes international standards covering the entire lifecycle of electrical and electronic control systems of nuclear power plants, from design to decommissioning. “We define safety as ensuring protection from non-intentional mistakes and security as ensuring protection against intentional attacks,” explains SC 45A expert (and previous Secretary) Jean-Paul Bouard. IEC 61513, for instance, specifies the general requirements for instrumentation and control systems used to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants. The IEC also developed cyber security standard IEC 62645 to minimize the impact of intentional attacks on nuclear plants. This standard covers program-level, architectural-level and system-level requirements.\n Read the full article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "A key new standard is soon to be released targeted at operators who use human machine interfaces (HMIs) to control manufacturing processes.",
        "content": "According to the IEC Electropedia, an HMI is a “display screen, either as part of an intelligent electronic device (IED) or as a stand-alone device, presenting relevant data in a logical format, with which the user interacts. An HMI typically presents windows, icons, menus and pointers, and may also include a keypad to enable user access and interaction.”\nHMIs have become ubiquitous across various industries as automation and digitization takes hold of industrial processes. They typically enable operators to monitor and control plants remotely.\nThe new standard is expected to be published by the end of August 2024. It deals with the complete lifecycle of HMIs, from conception to decommissioning. “The purpose of this document is to address the philosophy, design, implementation, operation and maintenance of HMIs for automation systems, including multiple work processes,” explains Dr Maurice Wilkins who jointly led the standard project, along with Dave Board, inside IEC Technical Committee 65. The TC prepares international standards for systems and elements used for industrial process measurement, control and automation. \nThe standard, IEC 63303, is based on a US document, ANSI/ISA-101.01, HMIs for process automation systems, which was published in 2015. According to Wilkins, “the IEC standard is more normative than the ISA one. We spent a good deal of time stress testing compliance with the normative requirements of the standard.”\nOne of the advantages of the international standard is that it has horizontal applications across many industries. “IEC 63303 is intended to be generic and focuses on the graphical user interface design and performance criteria to ensure operators have the best possible knowledge and situation awareness of the process they are overseeing,” Wilkins says.\nOther TCs inside the IEC can use the document as a basis for their own HMI standardization. ”The standard was submitted as a new project in March 2020 and we worked throughout the COVID pandemic, with several meetings held online. We finally got to a place where we were able to agree some of the final additions to the standard during a face-to-face meeting in London which took place around a year ago,” describes Board, who, along with Wilkins leads the working group which is developing the standard. Experts from many countries around the world have been involved in its development.\nThe standard is expected to be used by companies manufacturing, implementing, designing or using HMIs, across a wide range of manufacturing processes."

        "abstract": "If you read the news these days, you’ll see that AI can save the planet...and destroy it. Reports of the energy cost of AI models make for good headlines, but the reality is far from simple.",
        "content": "When leading AI scientist and climate lead at Hugging Face Dr Sasha Luccioni published a paper about how machine learning can be used to tackle climate change, her focus was on encouraging the use of the technology to solve global challenges .\n“AI can be used, for example, to discover new combinations of molecules for new kinds of batteries that are less mineral intensive than lithium, or track illegal loggers in a forest, or detect methane leaks from factories,” she said, speaking at the latest SC 42 workshop on AI.\nBut when another paper came out claiming that training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes, she decided to investigate. What she found was that not all AI models have the same carbon footprint and it’s complicated.\n“It’s true that certain AI models can use a lot of energy and emit a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. But it’s not binary. It’s not every single AI model. There’s a factor of 30 when it comes to difference in energy consumption between a model that extracts an answer to a question versus a generative model that can do multiple tasks and can generate text, for example.”\nLuccioni and her team are now working on an energy star rating system for AI models, which will enable users and developers of AI models to make more informed choices.\n“Not all AI models have a huge environmental footprint and it’s important to focus on smaller, more efficient models where we can,” she said.\n“Increased transparency will help compare the costs and benefits of AI and help people make more informed decisions.”\nLuccioni was one of a number of speakers at the fifth AI workshop delivered by SC 42, the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI. It featured presentations from international AI luminaries on the latest applications, trends, challenges and opportunities as it evolves. Speakers included leaders in the fields of policy, industry and academia, including representatives from the World Economic Forum (WEF), the European Commission, OECD, Council of Europe, open-source communities and national standards bodies as well as experts driving the standards.\nSustainability of the technology and AI as a tool to address climate change challenges was a key topic discussed. Given the enormous benefits that AI can deliver, the challenge, the experts agreed, was finding the optimal balance, while ensuring its use is safe and responsible.\nGovernments around the world are looking for solutions. The French government is working on initiatives to measure and reduce AI’s environmental impact with a framework and best practices around ‘frugal AI’.\n“We are seeing a huge increase in the use of generative AI, so we made it mandatory to provide a cost benefit analysis in all the funding programmes for AI”, said Juliette Fropier of the French government’s Ecolab.\n“Frugal or sustainable AI could be a differentiating factor for companies seeking funding for projects. But it is hard to compare them as there are different ways of calculating that so there is a need for a framework to measure and communicate on sustainable AI.”\nEveryone on the panel agreed that collaboration, consensus and transparency were key to developing solutions to measure and reduce the impact of AI on the planet, while at the same time enabling it to realize its potential to address environmental and societal challenges effectively.\nInternational standards are powerful tools to achieving that. Already, a number of standards exist, such as the ISO/IEC 30134 series for data centres by the joint IEC and ISO committee for sustainability, IT and data centres, SC 39.\nSpeaking at the workshop, SC 39 expert Phil Isaak outlined current and future standards in this area including the upcoming ISO/IEC 20125 which will provide a methodology, tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce digital services' environmental impacts.\nHarm Ellens, a project editor within SC 42 also described a technical report in development, ISO/IEC TR 20226, which will cover all aspects related to AI and environmental sustainability, including energy and water consumption, waste, carbon footprint, the AI system life cycle and supply chains.\nRecognizing the importance of this work and the synergies between the two committees, SC 39 and SC 42 recently created a joint advisory group (JAG): AI and Sustainability.\nThis is just the beginning. Transparency and a deeper understanding of AI’s impact on every aspect of society is only achieved through international collaboration, which is why the leading international standards organizations in the World Standards Cooperation, IEC, ISO and ITU, were prominent players at the recent AI for Good summit, in Geneva. There, they launched a project to address the challenges of deepfakes and generative AI.\nWatch the replay of the fifth SC 42 workshop on AI.\nLearn more about SC 42 from the Chair in this short video."

        "content": "In a society that is becoming increasingly all-electric, attention to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is growing and so is the need for related test requirements and standards. They ensure that smartphones, solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and all the multiple electronic devices we rely upon every day, which emit electromagnetic waves and which we use more and more, can work together and not interfere with each other. We ask the the Secretary of  IEC TC 77, which prepares standards for EMC,  about the main challenges ahead.\nWhat are the new technologies being addressed by TC 77?\nThey include 5G communication technologies, wireless power transfer (WPT) for electric vehicles (EVs), as well as power line communications and radar systems for autonomous vehicles. Existing test methods and requirements will be extended to take new electromagnetic influences into account.\nWhat are the challenges for standardization?\nOne of them is the voltage fluctuations in public power supply networks. They can be caused by charging stations for EVs, but also other equipment. Publications developed by one of our subcommittees (SC 77A) contribute to the stability of these networks and their power quality. Another challenge is the increasing use of switching power supplies, WPT technologies, radio communication modules in devices and systems – all of which lead to EMI in frequency ranges which were previously of minor interest. These include frequencies between 9 kHz and 150 kHz and frequencies above 6 GHz, which we now must consider. The expected operation of direct current (DC) high voltage networks will also be an issue. Finally, one of our SC’s (SC 77C) future work will address increased portability and the growing strength of geomagnetic storms, which could be due to climate change.\nSome manufacturers see EMC redesigns as an extra cost. How could this perception be changed?\nThe role and importance of EMC should be continuously communicated. It is in the interest of manufacturers to develop and market reliable products. Also, an equipment and system may function well now but that is not certain in the future if changes occur in the electromagnetic environment. ( Read the full article in e-tech)"

        "content": "AI has the potential to transform industries and solve many of the world’s greatest challenges – but at what cost? As concerns mount around the environmental impact of AI, the IEC and ISO’s joint committee for AI, SC 42, launches a new advisory group to develop solutions.\nThe rise and rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lives, revolutionizing whole industries such as healthcare, transport, agriculture and even the environment. A report by PWC showed that the use of AI could reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 4% in 2030, at the same time contributing up to $5.2 trillion USD and create over 38 million new jobs.\nYet at the same time, the amount of energy required to fuel AI applications and its subsequent environmental impact cannot be ignored. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity consumption from AI, data centres and the cryptocurrency sector makes up about 2% of global electricity demand, a rate that could double by 2026. They also predict that ‘by 2026, the AI industry is expected to have grown exponentially to consume at least ten times its demand in 2023’.\nRecognizing the need to address this issue, while at the same time enabling the benefits of AI to be realized, the joint IEC and ISO committees for AI (SC 42) and Sustainability, IT and Data Centres (SC 39), which are subcommittees of ISO/IEC JTC 1 (information technology) have established a joint advisory group (JAG): AI and Sustainability.\nCapitalizing on the expertise of the members in the fields of AI and sustainability, the JAG will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the issues, identify what standards exist that can help and where standardization is needed. From there they will provide a roadmap with recommendations for potential new projects.\nSC 42 Chair Wael William Diab said the committee has a long history of addressing societal concerns around AI, such as ethics and trustworthiness, to support the responsible deployment of applications.\n“AI and sustainability are top of mind for societies globally,” he said.\n“It is of equal importance whether it is the environmental impact of AI or the application of AI to sustainability challenges. International standards are a critical component to solving these challenges.\n“By leveraging our expertise and the power of international standards we aim to develop clear and achievable solutions that can help both users and developers of AI reap the benefits in a sustainable way.”\nSC 39 Chair David Reiner said, \"We are delighted to be working with SC 42, sharing the knowhow we've developed making ICT more sustainable and applying it to standards for AI\".\nJTC 1 Chair Phil Wennblom said: “Sustainability is one of the most pressing issues of our time. JTC 1 has a track record of finding solutions to many of the world’s challenges and we are committed to harnessing ICT technologies to do that.”\nAI and Sustainability was also a key topic at the recent SC 42 AI workshop that featured experts from industry, government and standardization presenting the latest trends and technologies.\nWatch the replay.\nLearn more about SC 42 in this brief video."

        "content": "IECRE is set to validate digital models for wind turbines as from the beginning of next year. This pioneering work could be a blueprint for IEC technical committees and other IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems to follow.\nThe wind industry has long made use of digital models in the testing and certification process of wind turbines and their various parts, such as rotor blades. The sheer size of these devices makes them difficult to test physically in the real world, hence the need to simulate tests, using digital modelling. Wind is not the only industry to do virtual tests. As Frank Ormel, an expert working in IEC TC 88, which prepares standards for wind energy generation systems, explains: “modelling is used everywhere where physical testing is not practical, too expensive and can be dangerous.”\nValidating digital models\nDigital models are widely used, but there are no established requirements for model validation, while these exist for tests performed in the physical world. Wolfram Zeitz, the Executive Secretary for IECRE, is genuinely astonished by the lack of interest for validation in the digital and virtual world. “It’s as if people lose their common sense when it comes to digital technologies and the latest buzzwords like AI or digital twins. How do we know that digital simulations are accurate? At the IEC, we spend quite a lot of time establishing requirements for physical testing, for instance the type of testing equipment used, and we want to ensure the highest accuracy as possible for these tests. And it should be the same with digital modelling: how do we validate the digital model to ensure the results it provides cover the real behaviour of a physical sample? If we don’t do that, wind energy systems will run into trouble sooner or later.”\nThe model validation service will be offered as from January 2025 and the overall model validation process will be carried out both by test labs and certification bodies in IECRE. “The validation of the model itself will be attributed to the test labs, while certification bodies will establish whether the model is accurate enough to be used in conformity assessment,\" Ormel explains.\nA project team inside TC 88, convened by Frank Ormel, is preparing a publicly available specification (PAS) on the validation of computational models, which could potentially lead to an IEC International Standard.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "Tipped as one of the next big trends in tech, quantum computing technology is storming ahead at lightning speed, promising to take computing to a whole new level. So much so that the value of this technology is expected to reach $1.3 trillion USD by 2035.\nIn 2019 Google claimed its quantum computer could solve in just a few minutes a problem that would have taken a traditional computer 10,000 years. While this figure was later put into doubt, what remains certain is the immense power that quantum computing has to analyse highly complex data patterns and simulate molecular formulations. It is for this reason it is a hot topic for investors and is tipped to revolutionize everything from drug development to car manufacturing, transport, finance and more.\nYet the power of quantum computing also raises concerns about security and safety, in particular it’s potential ability to break through data encryption mechanisms. While conventional computers have cryptographic mechanisms to protect against cyber attacks, these protocols are vulnerable to quantum computing based attacks with known algorithms.\nInternational standards present a valuable opportunity to help tackle this problem and enable the benefits of quantum to be realized without the risks. Through global understanding of the concepts involved and effective communication and consensus, solutions can be found to overcome safety issues and best practices agreed upon.\nThe first step in this process is creating a common language around which quantum computing concepts can be communicated. A new international standard has just been published to do just that.\nISO/IEC 4879 defines the terms and vocabulary commonly used in quantum computing, to enable all those involved in the field to be able to exchange information accurately.\nIt provides a solid basis upon which future standards and guidelines can be developed and paves the way for the interoperability of quantum computing elements.\nQuantum computing is just one aspect of quantum technologies for which the newly developed joint IEC and ISO committee for quantum, JTC 3, will develop standards.\nIts scope also includes quantum metrology, quantum sources, quantum detectors, quantum communications and fundamental quantum technologies.\nLearn more about IEC and quantum technology."

        "content": "Born 200 years ago on June 26, William Thomson was the first scientist to be elevated to Britain's House of Lords. Baron Kelvin of Largs, as he became, was also an accomplished engineer. Indeed, his contemporaries held him in such high esteem that when he died, in 1907, they laid him to rest next to Sir Isaac Newton, in Westminster Abbey.  \nKelvin is best known today for inventing the international system of absolute temperature that bears his name. He made important contributions to electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, geophysics and several other fields. \nAs an engineer, he was responsible for laying the first Atlantic telegraph cable, solving many technical problems along the way. He made his fortune designing and manufacturing instruments for the new electrical industries and the Royal Navy. \nKelvin was also a pioneer of international standardization, an interest that stemmed from his deep involvement in the scientific and practical aspects of electrical engineering. His work was fundamental in the development of today's electrical units and standards. In 1906, he became the first President of the IEC. \nGiven Kelvin’s many accomplishments, it is no wonder that his one of his biographers, Alexander Russell, wrote, “His work lives and will continue to live. To him it has been given to make history which will live so long as intelligent man survives on earth. As the years roll on our indebtedness to him increases.”\nWhy then is he largely unheralded today? A few years ago, the recipient of an IEC Thomas Edison Award joked that he was glad not to have won the more prestigious IEC Kelvin Award because all his friends had heard of Edison. \nThis is reflected in popular culture. According to the Movie Database, there are at least 22 films that involve Albert Einstein in some capacity. There are only two films that refer to Kelvin.\nThe first is the 2004 version of Around the World in 80 Days. It portrays Kelvin as a sociopath, who throws his enemies out of upstairs windows, and arch conservative who despises innovation and ambition in equal measure. In the film, Kelvin is determined by hook or by crook to thwart the hero’s quest to circumnavigate the globe in record time. This is somewhat ironic for a man who was “not just a titan of science but also a pioneer of harnessing innovation and applying it successfully in business”.\nWhen Kelvin is remembered, more often than not it is for the apparent hubris he displayed in dismissing some of the scientific discoveries of his time. He really did say, “X-rays are a hoax”. That is only part of the story, however. When Wilhelm Röntgen sent Kelvin a copy of his manuscript and x-ray photographs, Kelvin immediately changed his mind. \"I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted,” he wrote back to Röntgen. “I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made. \nAlongside the half-truths are one or two outright fibs, such as the notorious quote regularly misattributed to Kelvin: “There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement”. There is no record that Kelvin ever said any such thing.\nThis month’s bicentenary celebrations in Glasgow, London and online are an opportunity to shine the spotlight on Kelvin’s significant contributions to industry, science and standardization. In the meantime, for Kelvin fans, there is some consolation to be found in the second film that mentions the great man. The 2009 Star Trek movie reveals that Captain Kirk was born on the Starship Kelvin! In its way, this is a fitting tribute to the great scientist and inventor whose work boldly went where no one had been before. \n \nDisclaimer: views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the IEC."

        "content": "The last week of May saw senior officials, policymakers, industry leaders and academic experts from all over the world come together in Geneva at the WSIS +20 Forum High-Level Event 2024 to take stock of progress made towards building people-centric, inclusive and development-oriented information and knowledge societies through global digital collaboration.\nThe IEC joined the other World Standards Cooperation members, ISO and ITU at the event. The United Nations acknowledges the important role that the three international standards organizations play in providing “a trusted platform for digital cooperation among governments, industry, academia and civil society”.\nThe discussions focussed on harnessing international standards to advance Action Lines. These Action Lines play a vital role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIEC on cooperation between global standardization organizations\nPhilippe Metzger, IEC Secretary-General, Sergio Mujica, ISO Secretary-General and Seizo ONOE, Director of the ITU’s Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) took part in a roundtable discussion about fostering inclusivity.\nThe three WSC members take a global approach to standards development by bringing together a wide range of perspectives and expertise. For example, the IEC has members in around 170 member countries, as well as thirty thousand standardization and conformity assessment experts from a wide range of technical, academic and societal backgrounds.\nBy integrating such a wide array of voices in the standard-setting process, the three international SDOs ensure that the standards they develop are not only technically sound but also socially inclusive and responsive to the needs of a diverse global population. There is designed to be inclusive and helps to create standards that are relevant and accessible to all.\n\"From a practical point of view, standards are always more relevant when they address as many requirements as possible\", said Mr Metzger. \"We encourage the active participation of a broad range of stakeholders from all over the world and our consensus-based approach to standardization ensures that we take all views and needs into account\".\n\n\n(Right to left): Philippe Metzger, IEC Secretary-General, Sergio Mujica, ISO Secretary-General, Charlyne Restivo, moderator on behalf of ITU and Seizo ONOE, Director of the ITU’s Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) at the panel discussion on the opening day.\n\nThe WSC, a long-standing collaboration among IEC, ISO, and ITU, identifies synergies and avoids the duplication of efforts.\nRecent collaborative efforts have focused on areas such as sustainability, climate, artificial intelligence (AI), and smart cities.\nWSC is also working together on the Global Digital Compact, outlining its commitment to comprehensive coverage of digital technologies, bridging digital divides, and ensuring a safe and secure digital future for all. Read the statement issued by WSC in March 2024 here.\nFurthering the energy conversation\nAs part of the “ICT and emerging technologies” track at WSIS Forum, IEC also organized a session on Electricity for ICT in the 21st century. At the interactive session Vimal Mahendru, IEC Vice-President was interviewed by Gabriela Ehrlich, IEC Director of Communications, on making electricity efficient and accessible.\n\n\nVimal Mahendru and Gabriela Ehrlich speaking at the 'Electricity for ICT in the 21st century' session.\n\nThe session focused on the technological and environmental factors driving a shift in the fundamental ways we think of electricity, and how can we leverage these for ICT.\nMr. Mahendru drew attention to direct current (DC) based infrastructure as a solution to reduce energy wastage drastically, and its role in enabling electricity access. The interactive discussion delved into the issue of sustainable electricity.\nMr Mahendru highlighted the benefits of integrating renewable energy sources like solar PV, wind and marine energy, for example, all of which produce DC that can be used directly by batteries, electronics, sensors and electric vehicles without losing power in conversions between direct (DC) and alternating current (AC).\nThis makes DC less wasteful and more cost-effective and allows its integration with off-grid systems in areas that are hard to electrify.\nNaturally, enabling electricity access goes hand in hand with increasing ICT reach, thus facilitating solutions that impact almost all domains of our lives – education, healthcare, finance and more.  \nIEC is driving efforts in making DC and LVDC (low voltage direct current) technologies safe for use everywhere IEC work provides guidance to allow project developers, implementers and installers select the right system for the right place to ensure quality, safety and efficiency.The 2024 WSIS Forum was a time for reflection and refocussing our collective efforts towards advancing our global development goals. Looking ahead international collaboration and a responsive standardization framework will continue to play a key role in harnessing the potential of our ever-changing digital environment for the betterment of society.\nWSIS serves as a platform for multistakeholder discussions, and was co-organized by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP and UNCTAD and co-hosted by ITU and the Swiss Confederation."

        "content": "As I proudly handover to Dr Teruo Onishi from Japan, I have been reflecting on the honour it has been to lead IEC TC 106 over the past 9 years. I am most proud of the collaboration, culture and teamwork that really underpins everything we do. Great teams are motivated to go the extra mile, and I see that in all the IEC groups along with our partners at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\nFive areas of work really stand out for me:\n\n\n5G standards – delivering the EMF assessment standards ahead of time to meet the early deployments for 5G networks and devices. This includes the first Technical Report on 5G mmWave testing that became a reference for regulators globally. And more recently updating the early 5G standards as the technology evolves.\n\n\nWireless Power Transfer (WPT) – new testing methods and standards for this smart tech that is now truly going global. Many new cars now have wireless charging for devices and look how common it is for homes, cafés, universities, and many facilities to have wireless charging facilities. Smart cities and electric transportation of the future will all use WPT in some way.\n\n\nInspiring Young Professionals – TC 106 is a big supporter of the YP programme running dedicated workshops and engagement sessions to inspire the future. This is always rewarding to witness their excitement and provide opportunities for them.\n\n\nNavigating Covid – no one could have prepared us for Covid, but we rallied together, supported each other through the most challenging of times and came out the other side. It really taught me the value of collaboration, teamwork and now how to get the most out of face to face and hybrid working. But let’s hope we never go back to those Covid days!\n\n\nNew structure for the mobile device compliance assessment standards – with the significant advances in mobile phones and wireless devices over the past decade, comes the challenge of how to ensure the IEC test systems keep up! Well, they certainly have, and are adopting the latest and fastest tech available to the point that new assessment methods and validation requirements are needed. In a landmark update since the very first mobile test standards were implemented over 30 years ago, TC 106 has just approved a new restructured SAR testing series to streamline the approach into 4 different standards rather that a supersized jumbo standard that became quite frankly unworkable in 2024.  \n\n\nThank you to the IEC community, all the experts, conveners, officers and our partners at the IEEE and IEC Secretariat for the amazing support. It is the global community that makes it all work. My new journey takes me to the IEC Standardization Management Board, to look at how we adapt to and embrace the future. But look out for me at those YP workshops!"

        "content": "World Environment Day is celebrated every year on June 5 to raise awareness and encourage action to protect the environment. On this day, millions of people take part in registered activities around the world.\nIEC International Standards, especially when combined with conformity assessment help countries and industries to protect the environment. The IEC is active in areas such as renewable energy, LED lighting, smart grids and the circular economy. \nIEC Standards and conformity assessment contribute, both directly and indirectly, to the indicators for all 17 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. What all 17 SDGs have in common is that they depend on energy and especially electricity. \nThe UN recognizes that the world needs access to clean, affordable energy to foster economic development, improve healthcare and boost education. IEC work can facilitate the provision of affordable and reliable energy services, both off-grid and on-grid and can help to upgrade and expand a reliable energy infrastructure. \nIEC work provides the foundation for testing and certification, and for the measurement of energy efficiency. Over 160 IEC TC/SCs and all four conformity assessment systems contribute to SDG 7, for clean and affordable energy. \nThe IEC has developed a ground-breaking international standard for delivering clean energy through DC microgrids. The standard for low voltage direct current, LVDC, has already transformed the lives of rural communities in India and elsewhere in the developing world. \nIEC conformity assessment is delivering unique solutions to the challenges of sustainable development. These greenwashing, where unless there is a uniform, standardized way of measuring carbon emissions, organizations can make misleading claims about the impact of their products and services on the environment. \nThe IEC carbon footprint verification scheme provides independent verification that companies use the correct process, methodology and registers to calculate the carbon footprint of a given product. This service assesses and verifies that the processes for arriving at a carbon footprint claim have been followed properly and in accordance with a well-known ISO standard.\nOther examples are our work related to the circular economy and eco-design. SDG 12 calls for responsible consumption and production. Circular economy practices of reducing and eliminating waste through intelligent design, as well as keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, help to achieve this goal. \nThe IEC provides guidance and advice on issues such as e-waste, product end-of-life and recyclability, the eco-design of products, the dependability of products containing used parts, and ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment. Another standard sets the requirements and provides guidance on implementing environmentally conscious design, both for goods and services.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund provides grants for projects that address specific environmental, social and governance challenges using IEC international standards and conformity assessment. The first project is harnessing IEC expertise to improve the lives of people in rural Kenya by converting e-waste into e-resources.\nFind out more\nClimate action\nHow we contribute"

        "content": "In 2021, a district attorney in Pennsylvania accused the mother of a teenage girl of creating a ‘deepfake’ video to slander local cheerleaders. The accused became a pariah in her local community until the authorities realized they had made a mistake.\nOne way to avoid repeating this kind of scenario in the future and to combat ‘deepfakes’ in general is to provide a framework for establishing trust in media.  The JPEG Group takes this approach with a new ISO/IEC standard expected later this summer. \nThe JPEG group is part of the IEC and ISO joint technical committee, JTC 1. It also reports to the ITU. \nThe new standard, known as ‘JPEG Trust’, will provide a comprehensive and flexible framework for establishing trust in media. The framework can also be applied to video and audio.  \nRather than deciding what is trustworthy, the new standard describes tools and methodologies that individuals and organizations can use to create their own Trust Profiles. \nIt does this by linking images with their metadata and other provenance data to point up any attempt to tamper with them. The presence or absence of this information provides the contextual information for the establishment of trust in the image.\nJPEG Trust also addresses privacy and security concerns. Protecting information about an image may be essential to avoid revealing the identity of a whistleblower or of a photographer capturing an image in a conflict zone. \nIn both these examples, an organization or agency could sign the media asset instead of the photographer. \nJPEG Trust was a focus of the recent AI for Good summit, in Geneva. The discussion led to the announcement of a wider World Standards Cooperation project to address the challenges of deepfakes and generative AI. \nA diverse range of organizations are joining the IEC, ISO and the ITU in the initiative. They include the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). \nThe ITU-led initiative establishes a multistakeholder collaboration on global standards for AI watermarking, multimedia authenticity and deepfake detection technologies. It aims to provide a global forum for dialogue on priority areas, as well as mapping the landscape of relevant technical standards, facilitating the sharing of knowledge and identifying gaps where new standards or conformity assessment are required.\nFind out more\nJPEG\nRelated content\nVerifying fake media content"

        "abstract": "While industry on a global scale is responsible for a very high level of carbon emissions, there are ways for it to reduce its footprint, using IEC Standards and conformity assessment.",
        "content": "Industry on a global scale is trying to move to less carbon intensive practices but the scale and complexity of the challenge is huge. It has accounted for over 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, according to the World Economic Forum. It is the single largest emitting sector when accounting for its electricity use and heat generation. In addition, the WEF says that USD 13,5 trillion of investment is needed to “fast track” decarbonization of key industry sectors. However, research shows that solutions are within reach. In many cases, a transformation is well underway indicating that the pathway to net zero 2050 is not unachievable.\nThe example of the cement industry\nAn example of how industry is trying to clean up its act is the cement and concrete industry. Cement is the second most used substance on earth after water. It is vital for much of our modern infrastructure. It forms concrete when mixed with water and is used in the construction of everything from buildings and bridges to roads and pavements. It has also historically been detrimental to the environment and accountable for 7% of global carbon emissions. Production is forecast by the WEF to grow by 38% by 2050 if no intervention is made to use it more efficiently through design, re-use or recycling.\nPollution predominantly stems from the chemical reaction that turns limestone into cement, but also from the energy used to produce the high temperatures needed to make it. Additional carbon costs come from its transportation.\nEfforts to combat the challenge are being led by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). In 2021, its members signed up to the 2050 Net Zero Roadmap committed to accelerating decarbonization. Members include all the major cement manufacturers around the world as well as associations representing the industry.\nThe approach rests heavily on the development of carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) projects. This is expected to account for 36% of the industry’s global carbon reductions, according to the GCCA Roadmap. CCUS looks at concrete’s entire life cycle including the use of materials; manufacturing, transportation, construction processes; and post-construction maintenance, repair, and disposal or reuse.\nThe use of renewable energies is also part of the equation. Standards and conformity assessment have contributed to the fast growth rate for renewable energy capacity, as recorded by the IEA last year. Several IEC Technical Committees develop international standards for renewable energy systems including IEC TC 117: Solar thermal electric plants and IEC TC 114: Marine energy generation. IEC TC 82 standards are used the world over to produce solar photovoltaic modules or panels and the IEC 61400 standards published by IEC TC 88 are the industry-accepted benchmarks for wind energy generation systems. IECRE (the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) is the internationally accepted conformity assessment system for all power plants producing, storing, or converting energy from renewable sources.\nChecking the carbon footprint\nCarbon footprint claims are perhaps one of the most common indicators that companies use to reflect their efforts towards reducing emissions. However, the methodologies used by different organizations to arrive at the claims might differ and therefore the outcomes may not be comparable. To avoid misrepresentations, a verification of the carbon footprint of various products is essential. It is also a way of avoiding the “greenwashing” label which is applied to companies claiming that they are greener than they actually are.\nThis verification is one of the services offered by IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System, which is one of the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. It is based on ISO 14067, Greenhouse gases – Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "The Chair of IEC Technical Committee 13, which prepares standards for smart meters, is interviewed on the challenges ahead for the electricity grid as we move towards an all-electric society.",
        "content": "Peter Jensen is the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 13, which prepares standards in the field of electrical energy measurement and control, for smart metering equipment and systems forming part of smart grids. \nHe tells us more about the challenges for the electricity grid moving forward and how his TC is planning to help.\nWould you agree with the alarm bell rung by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently, urging countries to modernize their grids? (for more about the various reports read: Are grids ready for the all-electric and connected society?)\nThere is currently a large consensus both at political level and among energy professionals with the views presented by the WEF and the IEA. Accelerating electrification is an absolute necessity for the decarbonization of the energy sector. Electrification is critical to reaching the zero emission targets required to reduce our impact on the climate and thus on human life. Getting there is possible but requires bold decisions from the energy sector. This means building new sources of energy production, including renewable and hydroelectric generation wherever possible, as well as nuclear power in those countries which use it. Secondly, the transmission and distribution networks must be adapted, both to the new energy mix comprised of a large share of intermittent generation from the sun and wind as well as to the variability of electrical uses (such as heat pumps and the charging of electric vehicles). Work must also be done to reduce energy loss and support its better use – in other words, to improve energy efficiency. How this is handled will depend on the state of energy systems in different regions of the world. In emerging countries, the issue is to get electricity to remote and rural areas which are deprived of it, which is just as important. The IEC provides many of the standards to enable electricity access. We have quite a few African experts in TC 13 and some of them have brought major contributions to smart metering standards, notably for prepayment metering.\nWhat would you say are the main challenges for the grid as we move towards the all-electric and connected society?\nIn a modern society, electricity is as important as water. This means that the security and quality of the electricity supply cannot be compromised. We are therefore facing a double challenge as we have to change the energy mix to include a large amount of intermittent renewables, while maintaining a very high level of available electricity for all types of uses. Finding a balance between variable production and consumption, as well as taking into account recent advances in energy storage technology, requires the adaptation of both transmission and distribution grids. Energy storage, which is essential to meet the high electricity demand, can come from stationary batteries but also from electric vehicles (EVs) with vehicle-to-grid capacity, for example. The idea is to get EVs to charge during off-peak hours, for instance at night-time. And then to be able to supply extra stored energy to the grid during peak usage. To avoid massive and costly grid reinforcement, one of the single most important tasks is to develop and adopt new digital technologies to dynamically operate the grid.\nWhat are the key standards for smart meters?\nNotable standards for smart meters cover the metering used for billing, and we continuously update and enrich this set of standards. For example, TC 13 has produced IEC 62053‑41 for direct current (DC) energy metering, an essential standard for EV-charging manufacturers and market players. Fast charging relies on the availability of direct current and the infrastructure for fast charging is growing rapidly. We will probably have to upgrade it when IEC TC 8 publishes a standard for DC grids, which the market is waiting for. The TC has published a technical report on the topic but there is a need for an international standard and the experts are working on it.\nSeveral other standards cover requirements for the design and the testing of smart meters, as well as for prepayment metering. Another important set of publications is our IEC 62056 series, which defines the data-exchange application layer protocol and data model, also known as DLMS/COSEM suite of standards. They are essential to ensure the interoperability of commercial products, and most smart meters deployed around the world are compliant with this framework. The exception is the USA which still mainly uses its own standards, but we are working with ANSI towards a harmonization and co-branding of these standards.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

Being held on 28 May 2024 from 13.00 to 14.15 CEST, the webinar will bring together experts who will elaborate on guidelines and requirements to ensure robust and credible methodologies by giving practical information and real-life case-studies.\nThe issue of exaggerated or misleading environmental claims, resulting from poorly designed tests, will also be taken up during the discussion. The recently published IEC Guide 121, formulated by experts from the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Aspects (ACEA), outlines practical information on how to avoid such scenarios. The guide, which offers horizontal cross- industry solutions, can also help standard writers check and potentially adapt their documents to make them more robust and trustworthy.\n“Test procedures in standards can often be easily circumvented. We want to offer standard writers a framework to help them build credible, efficient and effective methodologies, and elevate the quality of tests across domains.” says Solange Blaszkowski, Chair of the ACEA.\nThe webinar will feature Mrs Solange Blaszkowski and other experts specializing in the field of environmental impact and material efficiency. These experts are involved in various regional, national and international levels of standardization.\nThe impact can be huge. Having dependable test results are key to optimizing solutions. As IEC’s founding president, Lord Kelvin wisely stated, “If you can’t measure things, you can’t improve them.”   And we must ensure that we can measure things well.\nIf you are involved in regulatory bodies, standardization research technical procedures for analysis or just generally interested in knowing more about how testing methodologies can be made more credible and their impact on our lives, this webinar is for you.\n \nFind out more about the webinar and registration information here."

        "content": "Electricity demand around the world is expected to sky-rocket as we switch to electric-powered vehicles, heat pumps for our homes and pursue the vast digital transformation of society. Alarm bells have been rung about the ability of the grid to meet this increasing demand, starting with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Economic Forum (WEF).\nOne of the solutions touted by experts is the use of smart grid technology as a less costly way of ensuring the grid can cope than investing in new or expanded networks. The IEC Electropedia defines the smart grid as an electric power system that utilizes information exchange and control technologies, distributed computing and associated sensors and actuators, for purposes such as the integration of the behaviour and actions of the network users and other stakeholders as well as efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies.\nAccording to the IEA, in a report that tracks the advancement of smart grids around the world, significant levels of investment in smart grid tech have been made in many countries around the world – even if much more needs to be done. Several examples are given, including the EU action plan Digitalisation of the energy system. The European Commission expects about EUR 584 billion (USD 633 billion) of investments in the European electricity grid by 2030, of which EUR 170 billion (USD 184 billion) would be for digitalization which includes smart meters, automated grid management, digital technologies for metering and improvement on the field operations.\nWhere standards can help\nIEC Standards pave the way for smart grid technologies to be used safely and efficiently. IEC TC 120 was set up to publish standards in the field of grid integrated electrical energy storage (EES) systems to support grid requirements. The TC is working on a new standard, IEC 62933‑5‑4, which will specify safety test methods and procedures for lithium-ion battery-based systems for energy storage. IEC TC 57 is the IEC committee which prepares core standards for the smart grid, notably the IEC 61850 series. They deal with substation automation, two-way information exchange, global control functions, renewable energy integration and cyber security, to name but a few. IEC TC 13 prepares key standards in the field of electrical energy measurement and control, for smart metering equipment and systems forming part of smart grids.\nA subcommittee of IEC TC 8 prepares standards dealing with the integration of renewable energy systems in the grid. One of the four IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems, IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications), is the internationally accepted CA system for all power plants producing, storing or converting energy from solar PV, wind and various forms of marine energy.\nThe IEC Systems Committee for Smart Energy (SyC Smart Energy) helps to coordinate and guide the various efforts across these different IEC technical committees. It is for instance working on a document, IEC 63460, that will describe the architecture and use cases for electric vehicles (EVs) to provide grid support functions. Most of this standard will be concerned with identifying realistic EV charging and discharging configurations, and the communication and control between the various actors, grid system operators, aggregators, premises energy management and EV charging systems. The results from this document will hopefully help other IEC technical committees to take the grid-support capabilities of EVs into account as they develop their own standards.\nRead the full article in e-tech, which contains a lot more information, including about vehicle- to-grid distributed energy resources and energy storage."

        "content": "Today, cars and vehicles have sophisticated connected systems, which allow them to see, hear and interact with copious amounts of data enabling enhanced monitoring and better diagnostic reporting.\nIn autonomous or self-driving vehicles, this gathering of information from sensors, processing it efficiently and responding appropriately in time is of the utmost importance. For autonomous vehicles to be safely deployed on roads, they need to do one thing extremely well: object detection. How does it work and how is IEC helping?\nSensors for object detection\nConnected cars (or vehicles) can communicate with systems outside the car. Sensors at various points in the car collect different data like speed or position and communicate it to the telematic control unit, which is responsible for navigation, control of vehicle speed, location tracking and other vehicle diagnostics or maintenance alerts.\nFor object detection, the primary sensors in play are:\n\n\nCamera sensors, capturing images of surroundings and providing visual input.\n\n\nRADAR sensors use radio waves to detect distance of objects and can supplement the camera’s input during poor visibility conditions like rain or fog.\n\n\nLiDAR sensors which use laser pulses to build an accurate map of the surroundings.\n\n\nOften, all these sensors are deployed and information from them works together in fusion.\nAll these combined, can help the autonomous vehicle see – detect distance to an object, or information about speed, estimate the 3D shape of the object, and assist with adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring.\nComputer vision\nIn autonomous vehicles, computer vision is key to object detection on the road and enabling perception of the car’s environment with high levels of accuracy. Computer vision involves analyzing images or visual information with an AI model to automate actions based on that understanding. They can have a substantial impact on telematics with applications ranging from smart parking in general cars to avoiding collisions in autonomous driving.\nHow is IEC helping?\nTechnical committees at the IEC look at crucial elements of connected car systems, developing standards contributing towards a secure connected road infrastructure. \nIEC TC 47 prepares international standards for semiconductor devices. One of its standards, IEC 62969-1 specifies requirements for power interfaces in automotive vehicle sensors, ensuring reliable communication and compatibility. It is also in the process of looking into testing methodologies for the performance of different detection modules in autonomous land vehicles such as the ultrasonic and visual imaging modules.\nThe information from the sensors then needs to be relayed to and fro across various connected internal and external systems. By creating a This is how a car service provider can keep track of the car’s route and performance or alerts can be sent out during an emergency.\nThe joint IEC and ISO committee on IoT, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41, sets standards for the Internet of Things, ensuring safety, reliability and compatibility of connected devices across various applications.\nTo ensure safety of these channels of information exchange, the IECEE cyber security certification programme allows manufacturers and parties involved in developing consumer IoT to reduce cyber risks to their devices by certifying to a widely used cyber security standard in the field (ETSI EN 303 645).\nThe IEC Quality Assessment System, IECQ, further enables the assessment of sensor manufacturers and associated service providers to see if they comply with the agreed international standards required for sensors. Sensors are just a small part of the broad scope for IECQ certificates.\n \nWhile research from all over the world on more efficient sensor modules and in technologies for mining data is pushing innovation, autonomous or connected vehicles are still a long way from making a commercial splash in most countries. Although challenges related to establishing a secure infrastructure persist, progress is steadily underway.\n \n\n\nDiscover more about sensors and connected cars in the e-tech article, ‘smart sensors for safer roads’."

        "content": "Extended versions of IEC International Standards, or EXVs, are part of a growing portfolio of value-added products the IEC is offering to standards users. With extended versions, users are able to seamlessly and efficiently consult IEC publications from a single document.\nRecognizing that it may be difficult and time consuming to consult IEC Standards and their references simultaneously, the extended version compiles the key information and content into a single, easy to use document. The extended version includes the relevant clauses from one publication inserted directly into the second publication and highlighted for easy reference.\n“We are very excited to offer IEC publications as extended versions. This will allow users to have an enhanced experience with our standards while also saving precious time,” notes Guilaine Fournet, Head of Sales & Business Development.\nOver 40 IEC Standards have been published as extended versions to date. Several manufacturers, interviewed as part of the market research to better understand user needs, expressed their enthusiasm. Market interest is high.\nAccording to a representative from a leading manufacturer in Germany, “EXVs help a lot and provide huge benefit. They are easier to read and will be very beneficial for those who are relatively new to standards as it reduces the number of documents to be read simultaneously.” Another manufacturer from Japan agreed. “It is easy to understand the relationships between documents with the EXV. It will help to save time in reading and understanding publications.”\nEXVs are also beneficial to those who are new to standards. New standard users can save time by accessing all of the necessary information from a single document. As notes another manufacturer from Germany, “EXVs can target people that are not yet into standardization. The next generation of users would like quick and easy access to information and EXVs could provide the answer.”\nBy the end of 2024, an extra 56 standards are expected to be published as EXVs.The following TCs and SCs have published extended versions of their standards:\n\nIEC SC 17A Switching devices\nIEC SC 17C Assemblies\nIEC SC 22E Stabilized power supplies\nIEC SC 22H Uninterruptible power systems (UPS)\nIEC SC 23B Plugs, socket-outlets and switches\nIEC SC 59C Electrical heating appliances for household and similar purposes\nIEC TC 61 Safety of household and similar electrical appliances\nIEC SC 61D Appliances for air-conditioning for household and similar purposes\nIEC SC 61J Electrical motor-operated cleaning appliances for commercial use\nIEC TC 66 Safety of measuring, control and laboratory equipment\nIEC TC 96 Transformers, reactors, power supply units, and combinations thereof\nIEC TC 116 Safety of motor-operated electric tools\nIEC SC 121B Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear assemblies\n\nWatch the video to find out more about the benefits of EXVs for standards users."

        "content": "International funders have committed to electrifying 150,000 healthcare facilities in rural Africa and India over the next three years, yet these solar power plants risk becoming obsolete and creating solar graveyards, according to industry expert Ray Gorman at the recent IEC Academy webinar on IEC and the Global Impact Fund.\nGorman, of IEC Global Impact Fund (IEC GIF) implementing partner Differ Community Power (DCP), said budget cycles typically incentivize CapEx over OpEx investments, meaning that most solar PV systems installed don’t receive end-of-life management or repair, with brand new systems often installed next to them instead.\n“For most of these systems, the batteries are the only irrecoverable component, while most of the other key components have an expected lifetime of more than ten years. The installation of second-life batteries could be a highly cost-effective way to rehabilitate them. This is why the IEC Global Impact Fund is so important, as its first project, which is about turning battery e-waste into e-resources in Africa aims to test ways to rehabilitate these dead systems and bring them back to life.” International standards and conformance are central to this.\nGorman was one of a number of panelists in the webinar, discussing how the IEC GIF demonstrates, as well as informs way to increase the significant impact of international standards and conformity assessment in addressing sustainable development as enshrined in the UN SDGs.\nDCP, was selected to determine the feasibility of using second life lithium batteries to rehabilitate solar PV installations at critical locations such as schools, health centres and hospitals in Kenya and is working closely with the IEC National Committee (NC) in Kenya to ensure it maintains local relevance while being institutionally engaged at the national level.\nSecretary of the IEC Kenyan NC Zacheus Ireri Mwatha said affordable electricity is essential to the economic development of any country, but it needs to be reliable.\n“75% of households in Kenya have access to electricity, but there are still outages, affecting essential services such as hospitals and schools. What’s more, 87% of electricity in Kenya comes from renewable sources and some systems are coming to the end of their first life. So we hope that the knowledge gained from this project can be used to rehabilitate other plants in areas that the pilot won’t reach.”\nThe IEC GIF also helps to address climate issues through decarbonization. Panelist Elena Crete, Head of the Climate & Energy Programme at the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) highlighted this as she detailed the Deep Decarbonization Pathway Project involving 16 of the biggest emitting countries.\n“What we found was that electrification is the cheapest and fastest option to decarbonize the most carbon emitting energy systems within those countries. So this question of expanding electricity and using electro technological solutions is incredibly important, specifically in the face of climate change and in our pursuit of the Paris Agreement goals.”\nModerating the session, IEC GIF Senior Advisor and Officer Matthew Doherty emphasized the importance of partnerships to ensure the success of the initiative, in the first project as well as future ones.\nFinancing partners are a key part of this, he said, and the Fund signed its first funding agreement with the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS), earlier this year.\nKATS liaison officer to the IEC GIF, Dr Jinseok Bae, was also on the panel, along with Kory Eguino, Executive Secretary of the Pan American Standards Commission (COPANT) and Dr Hao Hu, Deputy Director General of the International Standards Department at the Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.\nDr Hu gave an update on the upcoming IEC Global Impact Fund Forum to be held in Nanjing, China on 24 June 2024.\nLearn more about the IEC Global Impact Fund.\nWatch the replay of the webinar.\nLearn more about IEC Academy webinars and the IEC and the SDGs series."

The project is about digitalizing processes and workflows, rather than focusing only on digital tools. \nIn this context, training is crucial. The OSD product owners, Alisdair Menzies and Sei-Yun Park-El-Darwish, have been meeting IEC Technical Committee (TC) and National Committee (NC) experts online and in-person to communicate the benefits and rationale of the new workflow management techniques.\nThe OSD team is organizing monthly feedback sessions for NC users to have a more dynamic exchange about potential improvements and evolutions, as well as monthly onboarding sessions for TCs and SCs (subcommittees) for project leaders and convenors to start their projects in OSD.\n“Training is crucial,” says Mr Menzies. “It’s not only about explaining how the platform works but also listening and learning from our users.”\n“It is really important for us in the project group to have the user perspective,” adds Ms Park-El-Darwish. “They often have good ideas that we can use and above all, we can identify possible barriers to adoption.”\n\n\n\nLeft to right: Alisdair menzies, Sophie Clivio and Sei-Yun Park-El-Darwish\n\n\nThey recently travelled to Paris to bring the IEC’s French NC up to speed with the latest update and new features. It was also an opportunity to run hands-on practice sessions on both authoring and member commenting.\n\nIn their opening remarks, the IEC Director of Standardization, Sophies Clivio, and the Secretary of the French NC, Eric Laurençon, highlighted the importance of leveraging the considerable collective expertise of the IEC community:\n“You, the experts, are at the heart of standardization,” said Mr Laurençon. \"Your expertise is indispensable to the development of standards and your time is precious.\n“A tool like OSD makes the process of standardization so much more efficient, placing the expert’s technical know-how front and centre.”.\nMs Clivio added, “Transparency and consensus building are part of our DNA as an organization. OSD makes it so much easier for all of the gathered experts to contribute in a meaningful way and to collectively tackle issues as a group of active participants.”\nSandrine Vogt of the French NC believes the session in Paris was a valuable experience. \"I am delighted that Alisdair and Sei-Yun could come to our offices\", she said.\nSeveral other members have organized training sessions on OSD for their experts. Recently, for example, Ms Park El Darwish and Mr Menzies have provided training to US and Japanese NC experts. \nIn all these sessions, the combination of presentations and practical exercises has elicited an enthusiastic response, as well as some very constructive feedback which will be integrated into future iterations of the tool.\nThe OSD platform is a joint IEC and ISO project that provides standards developers with new digital tools to streamline the process of drafting and editing international standards. The platform enhances efficiency and collaboration throughout the process, from the preparation of a standard to its final publication.\nIt gives TC experts access to web-based tools for drafting and editing international standards. These digital tools help to streamline the standards development process as well as facilitate collaborative work by allowing standards developers to work simultaneously on the same document.\nThe platform makes it easier for NCs to participate in the process by offering a single online tool that encompasses the full standards development workflow. It also facilitates commenting and comment resolution by eliminating the need to manage multiple documents or complete separate forms.\nThese features help to ensure that the development of international standards is a smooth and inclusive process for all involved parties.\nAll IEC TCs and subcommittees will have at least one project on the OSD platform by the end of 2024."

        "content": "Smart manufacturing is no longer new, and those businesses powering ahead are those that are embracing digital transformation and ‘Industry 4.0’. New and not so new technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things are driving automation, predictive maintenance and robotics, resulting in greater innovation and efficiencies.\nIntelligent manufacturing is also improving the safety of employees by replacing many tasks that were dangerous or repetitive. But they come with their own risks, such as poor programming and malfunctioning, not to mention concerns around privacy, trustworthiness and data integrity.\nAs we move into ‘Industry 5.0’, where there is more focus on humans and their interaction with machines, the question is: as machines become more intelligent, how can we keep humans safe?\nIEC has several technical committees dedicated to developing standards for machine safety, such as TC 44 and SC 65A (functional safety). But safety management requires a holistic approach, covering not just the machines but the management, processes and competencies of the personnel involved.\nIt is for this reason that or this reason IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment  has recently launched its Certification of Personnel Competence (CoPC) scheme with its first competence area aimed at supporting safety in the manufacturing industry.\nBased on ISO/IEC 17024, the scheme will offer national certifying bodies (NCBs) the ability to assess the competency of those working in various industry sectors, to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to use, manage, repair, maintain or interact with machinery in a safe way.\nIt also provides the industry with a reliable benchmark of what is considered ‘competent’ across the world. For manufacturing this will include aspects such as management, design of installations, equipment selection, inspection, maintenance and repair.\nWhile the scheme will start with certification related to machinery safety, it is intended that other competence areas will be added according to market needs, with functional safety and cyber security already identified.  \nAs with all conformity assessment schemes within IECEE, it will involve a framework for evaluation, with a bank of test questions added and refined by the certification bodies themselves. This ensures that the exams taken are relevant to the industry and reflect international best practices. It also creates an equal playing field for all participating NCBs.\nExecutive Secretary of IECEE, Wolfram Zeitz said the scheme will be modelled on the well-established IECEx Scheme for Certification of Personnel Competence adjusted to the IECEE environment, and will further evolve as more certification bodies get involved.\n“The best way to ensure such schemes are truly effective and relevant is to get the input of those in the industry who are using them,” he said.\n“For this reason, we welcome active contributions from certification bodies wanting to offer IECEE certification of personnel competence. What’s more, it offers them an opportunity to have their say on what they believe is best for the scheme and help shape it for the benefit of all.”\nLearn more about IECEE."

What are the main changes that have affected TC 10 Standards in recent years?\nThe engagement in environmental issues has definitely become a high priority. For example, unused mineral oils are now classified based on their performance rather than origin, and hazardous chemicals are being substituted by non-hazardous alternatives. Additionally, standards describing the use of alternatives to sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) have been created. Overall, the requirements for insulating fluids in service have become more stringent. One notable example is how IEC 60296, which specifies mineral insulating oils for electrical equipment, has evolved over the years. We published the latest edition of the standard in 2020 and it now deals also with recycled mineral oils, which was not the case in our earlier editions. The first edition of this standard, as a full publication, was issued in 1969 and things have changed a lot since then!\nWhat would you say are the main challenges for your TC in coming years?\nThe main challenges for our TC in the years ahead include the introduction of more environmentally friendly insulating liquids and the development of new test methods that require fewer hazardous chemicals. Additionally, we anticipate that digitalization will play a more significant role in the creation of standards.\nWhat are the important standards you are working on which will published in 2024?\nI am pleased to announce that we have several standards currently in the final draft stage, which will soon be published. One of them is a first edition, and deals with alternative gases to sulphur hexafluoride, which is a pollutant greenhouse gas and is also dangerous to manipulate.

        "published_day": "2024-05-02",
        "abstract": "Hydrogen technologies present a promising strategy towards decarbonization. Learn how the aviation industry is planning on leveraging hydrogen to reduce its carbon footprint.",
        "content": "Multiple countries are finding hydrogen an achievable option in their decarbonization strategy. The aviation industry is largely resolving to move towards a low carbon economy by 2050.\nA sizeable portion of the plans involve investing in innovative technologies and investigate possibilities with electric and hydrogen.\nAs hydrogen continues to become a more feasible fuel alternative, IECEx will have an important role to play in ensuring safe infrastructure around hydrogen technologies.\nWhy is hydrogen a good option?\nHydrogen has a much higher energy per unit mass ratio than traditional jet fuel. Potentially clean hydrogen generated with renewable energy sources would be an ideal alternative as it would not involve any carbon emissions. Even hydrogen that involves carbon emissions in production and storage would still cut down the emissions during its combustion to produce energy.\nHow can hydrogen help decarbonize aviation?\nIn the aviation sector, hydrogen can play a role on two fronts:\n\n\nIt can be used to reduce emissions in the air.\n\n\nIt can be incorporated as an alternative to decarbonize airside ground activities.\n\n\nAirbus, an industry giant, considers hydrogen to be an important technology pathway leading to their plans of introducing a low-carbon commercial aircraft to market by 2035.\nBy Airbus’s estimates, hydrogen can potentially reduce aviation’s carbon emissions by up to 50%. Sabine Klauke, Chief Technology Officer of Airbus, shared, “Together with our partners, we recognise the potential of hydrogen becoming a longer-term decarbonisation pathway for aircraft operations, complementing sustainable aviation fuel, in support of our transition towards net zero by 2050”.\nMany more are racing towards getting ‘hydrogen-ready’ flights that use hydrogen to power a flight, either partially or fully.\nAre we cleared for take-off yet?\nBesides getting the technology market-ready, there are infrastructural challenges with switching to hydrogen as a fuel. Although its energy per unit mass is high, it occupies a large volume. The practical implication is that it requires more storage space. In a commercial flight, provisions will have to be made to have fuel tanks suitable to contain hydrogen, and space to accommodate sufficient gas to fuel short flight distances.\nAdditional supply, operations and safety infrastructure will have to be built in the different airports that would cater to a hydrogen-powered flight. Furthermore, getting the whole setup ready and the relative price of hydrogen as a fuel in comparison to traditional fuels can be quite cost-intensive.\nIECEx for a safe market\nDespite its challenges, hydrogen remains a promising strategy to progress upon the road towards decarbonization. As research and technological innovation progresses, standards and testing and certification to comply with government policies will be needed to pave the way for effective commercialization.\nIECEx has been helping facilitate quality infrastructure for hydrogen for decades.

        "content": "As part of its unwavering commitment to supporting efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the IEC Academy kicked off its new webinar series last week, IEC and the SDGs: partnering for a safe, efficient and inclusive future.\nThe first in the series, SDGs and electrotechnology: driving sustainable development focused on two specific SDGs: SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). It was moderated by Sonya Bird, Vice President of International Standards at UL Standards & Engagement.\nIn opening the webinar, IEC President Jo Cops said IEC international standards and conformity assessment systems play a critical role in ensuring the smooth interoperability, safety and reliability of technologies central to renewable energy efficiency, energy storage and smart grids.\n“We've pioneered a groundbreaking standard for rural electrification through direct current microgrids. Through these efforts we directly contribute to SDGs 7, 9 and 11, focusing on energy access, resilient infrastructure, and sustainable cities. Through international cooperation we can forge comprehensive solutions for sustainability, security and resilience.\nIEC Vice President and Chair of the IEC Standardization Management Board Vimal Mahendru gave an overview of how electrotechnology is relevant to the SDGs.\n“If we take electricity. Can you think of any way that a country can address poverty without using it? Or electrotechnology, that is, electricity, electronics or software. Any meaningful job or creation of value in society requires technology.”\nHe also highlighted the example of a recently published standard for low voltage direct current, IEC 63318.\n“This standard is pivotal to bringing electricity to those who have never had it before,” he said.\nEnergy engineer and a member of the IEC TC 82 for solar PV, Tanoh Frack-William Gnangny gave a tangible example of where IEC standards contribute directly to SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.\nThe Ecler Ivoire project in the Ivory Coast involved the construction of 16 mini solar PV power plants to improve access to electricity for 10,000 inhabitants in a rural area, with the help of IEC standards.\n“But more needs to be done, and the ongoing development of standards will make it possible to give light and affordable energy to more people in the world.”\nPascal Terrien, Chair of the IEC Smart Energy Systems Committee and Chief Standardization Officer at EDF said low carbon electricity is now seen by the International Energy Agency as the solution for decarbonization and climate change mitigation.\n“We are now faced with a more complex energy system and we need to take into account this new complexity. In the IEC Smart Energy Systems Committee we try to understand the needs of our stakeholders and look at innovations in technologies, the market and of course different policies and regulations. We then map existing standards and try to fill the gaps of what else needs to be done.”\nDr Ian Opperman is an international thought leader on the digital economy, helping governments accelerate digital service delivery, and is Industry Professor at the University of Sydney. He talked about the importance of understanding data to address the SDGs.\n“We can use data and ways of understanding data, to better understand the world around us, and to understand root causes of significant problems, and then to start to explore. Well, what if we did this, what if we did that?\n“If we bring more ways of seeing and understanding the complex pathways between what we do and the real-world outcomes those pathways of impact, we stand a much better chance of understanding than if we do these things at a system at a component level. Data is a great way of understanding those impact pathways, and AI is a really important way of dealing with the complexity of those real-world outcomes.”\nHe also highlighted the relevance of the work being done in the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42.\n“The ISO/IEC 42001 standard released recently talks about the management of AI systems and is underpinned by some other great standards around data usage,” he said.\nAbderrahim Taibi, General Director of the Moroccan Standardization Institute (IMANOR) and the Secretary of the IEC National Electrotechnical Committee (COMELEC) talked about the challenges for developing countries and how it was necessary to not only have access to new technologies but also the methods and skills.\n“Our companies need to understand the requirements of the markets now and the future and the technical requirements as well. Standards are the bridge for our companies to access international markets and be able to benefit from new technologies.”\nThe webinar concluded with some powerful reminders of where the world is at with regards to the SDGs and what needs to be done.\n“Sustainability is not a spectator sport,” said Mahendru. “We cannot sit on the side and say, hey, the government is addressing it, or IEC is addressing, or somebody else is doing it. If we want to create a better world, we need to feel uncomfortable with our current situation, and we need to get involved.\nOpperman echoed his thoughts.\n“It's wonderful that we're getting passionate about this, but it’s not enough. We will reach a point very soon where there are really important decisions we need to make, which can only be made if we can make data driven evidence-based decisions around what we need to do.\nWatch the replay here.\nLearn more about the panelists.\nThe IEC Academy IEC and the SDGs webinar series aims to explore the role IEC can play in helping countries with the effective implementation of SDGs. By highlighting the practical applications of standards in addressing priority SDGs, the series contributes to informed decision-making and policy development. It is hoped that this series will inform the IEC community about the various processes in relation to the SDGs and actively contribute to the UN Summit for the Future.\nLearn more about IEC Academy webinars."

        "content": "Hydrogen is making headway as a promising alternative to fossil fuels and is tipped to play a significant role in achieving decarbonization goals. It is also transforming the transport sector, including rail.\nWhile electric-powered trains are nothing new, most of those in existence require significant infrastructure such as electric wires and substations. Trains that run on hydrogen fuel cells, however, offer the advantage of requiring less infrastructure and able to travel much further on a single charge, making them practical solutions for long distance lines and in regions where the geography is more challenging.\nAs a result, there is a growing number of projects to build hydrogen-powered trains around the world, mainly in developed countries.\nIn 2018, the world’s first commercial hydrogen-powered trains began operations in the Lower Saxony region of Germany. After several years of testing, 14 hydrogen-powered trains were officially commissioned in 2022, at a cost to the German government of EUR 85 million. Now there are 41 other hydrogen-powered trains currently in service in the Frankfurt region.\nHigh-speed hydrogen trains are also in the pipeline. A consortium of 10 Spanish companies are in the process of developing a high-speed train system fueled by hydrogen fuel cells and batteries.\nAll of this is good news for the planet and for the people, but we’re not there yet. New technologies such as this require significant investment.\nInternational standards will be instrumental to the expansion of the market for hydrogen trains as they bring together international best practice to ensure reliability, performance, safety and provide a platform on which innovation can happen. By enabling interoperability, they can be powerful tools to accelerate the industry’s growth.\nWhile there are international harmonized requirements for electric and diesel-powered trains to demonstrate, for instance, safety and performance, none exist for hydrogen. This means much time and energy is spent in undergoing testing and evaluating to different criteria to ensure components and systems are fit for purpose and safe.\nIEC TC 9 is working on a series of standards to fill this gap. IEC 63341‑1 will define the requirements for the design of fuel cell power systems, while IEC 63341‑2 will cover hydrogen fuel systems, including the storage and distribution of hydrogen on a train. The third in the series, IEC 63341‑3, will detail performance requirements and test methods.\nRead more in the latest issue of e-tech."

        "content": "Alejandro B. Martínez Muelas is the Vice Chairman of Measnet (International Network of Wind Energy Measurement Institutes), a non-profit organization comprising the most experienced wind energy institutes from around the world, which aims to work out rules and requirements which will guarantee that high quality comparable measurements are made by its members. The non-profit is also actively participating in IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, and, with its support, has decided to publish proficiency test reports which are and will be available for free to the whole wind energy industry. The first report is on the power performance of wind turbines and can be obtained from Measnet.\nWe ask him why proficiency tests are essential to ensure trust in IECRE testing and certification. (Read the full interview in e-tech.)\nWhat are proficiency tests?\nThe aim of proficiency tests – assuming that we all are measuring the same wind turbine and the same wind – is to ensure that we have comparable results. What we are saying with the proficiency test report is that no matter the test lab you use, no matter who is doing the job, the results will be the same. A lab in China will give the same results as a lab in Germany or in Spain, which is in the IECRE system. Any manufacturer in the world can trust that labs in the IECRE system will provide the same results.\nWhat does a proficiency test measure?\nTo be part of the IECRE system, the technical laboratories have to prove that they themselves can perform correctly and test wind turbines correctly. Proficiency tests are exercises in which the laboratories show their competency. The first report we issued is about how the laboratories can measure the power performance of the turbine (how much energy the wind turbine is generating compared to the energy already provided by the wind). But there are other tests, for instance about vibrations: will the wind turbine be capable of withstanding vibrations? There are also tests which deal with wind blades: are the wind blades strong enough to withstand the wind? These tests and many more are all part of the certification process of the wind turbine.\nWhy did you decide to publish this first report and why is it so important?\nMeasnet was criticized a few years ago because we were said to not be transparent enough with our way of working. Now we are part of IECRE which is a system comprising not only testing laboratories but also certification bodies, manufacturers and users, which are often utilities. All these stakeholders need to trust in the tests we are providing. In order to ensure trust, we decided at the beginning that some results would be made public. Everybody in the IECRE system would have to see who participated in the proficiency testing, who passed the tests and what was checked. And once that decision was taken, we wanted to go as public as possible. The document we published is especially long and complex and that degree of transparency was never reached before."

        "content": "Powered by the light of the sun, solar cars offer the potential to significantly reduce pollution and carbon emissions from our roads and provide a clean and sustainable way to get around. Solar powered cars have been in existence for solar car racing for decades but making them a commercially viable option to serve as the family car has proven more challenging.\nWhile a number of companies have tried and failed to get solar cars commercialized, more recent attempts are showing more promise. US company Aptera recently announced it had raised over USD 33 million to fund the initial stages of production for its solar electric vehicle, equipped with 700 watts of solar cells and able to drive over 600 kms on a single charge. Already, more than 46 000 reservations have been made, though it is not clear when it will be available.\nMeanwhile, in Japan, the Puzzle van, a tiny electric van using solar panels to charge its battery, was unveiled late last year, and is due to be available for purchase from 2025.\nIn order for the market for solar cars to truly take off, the quality, performance and durability of the solar panels used needs to be assured.\nIEC International Standards provide internationally agreed specifications and guidelines to ensure the quality, safety and efficiency of products, services and systems. Conformity assessment determines whether a product, service or process complies with specified standards. Standardization also provides a common language and framework fostering interoperability, efficiency, safety and overall reliability.\nIEC TC 82: Solar photovoltaic energy systems, produces international standards enabling systems to convert solar power into electrical energy. These include the 14-part IEC 60904 series of standards, which covers all the requirements and measurements of photovoltaic (PV) devices and their components.\nRecognizing the need for specific guidance documents in this area, the committee has formed a project team, IEC TC 82 PT 600, for vehicle integrated photovoltaic systems (VIPV) to develop two new technical reports in this area.\nWe spoke to the Convenor of the project team in the latest issue of e-tech.

Such an approach is vital in today’s world where innovations hinge on several emerging technologies working in synergy.” says Professor Coallier.\nThe committee aims to identify and assess potential new forthcoming bio-digital convergence topics and anticipate challenges that may become relevant to IEC activities.\nOne of the key outcomes of this committee would be to provide standards developers a clarity about how their work interlinks to a wider array of standards, identify new opportunities and, in doing so, contribute to an efficient and productive development process.\nAccording to Coallier, the Systems Committee should serve as a means for National Committees to identify and internally organize or monitor their standardization activities. It can be a tool to let them identify and offer relevant standards to industry to boost innovation or growth in a particular domain.\nTo address modern innovation challenges, a holistic approach is essential. François Coallier has enthusiastically embraced the role and expressed his excitement to drive this transformation.\nLearn more:\n\nA standard journey for bio-digital convergence\nUnderstanding bio-digital-convergence"

        "abstract": "Electricity is a clean way of propelling ships and it is becoming the option for ferries and pleasure boats. IEC Standards and conformity assessment ensure it is used safely.",
        "content": "According to estimates published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by international shipping have accounted for 2,2% of carbon dioxide emissions in recent years. In 2023, IMO announced its ambition to reach net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by or around 2050. Several advances in the field of electrical and electronic devices and systems are making this target achievable. The increased use of electricity on board and when in port is helping the industry to clean up its act.  ( Read the full article in e-tech ).\nElectric batteries for ferries\nNorway is leading the way when it comes to electric battery powered vessels: today the country has approximately 70 electric ferries in operation. Ferries are perceived to be ideal candidates for battery power as they generally travel short distances and are not as big as huge cargo ships. Electric batteries are heavy, take up a lot of room and cannot really be used on ships which already carry heavy loads. Advances in battery tech – mostly coming from the automotive industry – are expected to have implications for electric-propelled ships, starting with pleasure boats and yachts. According to Christian Hallberg, Commercial Director of a company which makes electric motors for sailboats and ferries, “The main technical issues remain weight and voltage limitation. In the automotive industry, things are evolving faster than analysts predict. Within five years, I think we should have gained 50% on both the price and the weight of batteries. Hybrid and all-electric will become the basic proposition for the majority of sailboats by that time.”\nHydrogen powered ships on the horizon\nHydrogen can be produced from a range of resources, including fossil fuels, nuclear energy, biomass and renewable energies. The only carbon neutral hydrogen is hydrogen generated from solar or wind energy sources. Currently, it only makes up about 0,1% of the overall hydrogen production but this could change if and when the cost of renewable energy decreases. The hydrogen could then be used to produce electricity through fuel cell technology.\nThe MF Hydra, owned by one of Norway’s leading ferry and express boat operators, claims to be one of the first commercial passenger and car ferries fuelled by liquid hydrogen and powered by 200 KW fuel cell modules.\nIEC Standards and conformity assessment for the maritime industry\nTwo IEC technical committees are dedicated to preparing international standards for the maritime industry. In cooperation with IMO, IEC TC 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems, has taken on the role of developing international standards for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), an internationally agreed set of safety procedures and communication protocols used to increase safety and make it easier to rescue ships in distress. IEC TC 18: Electrical installations of ships and of mobile and fixed offshore units, also cooperates with IMO where electrical systems on board ships are concerned. It publishes international standards in line with the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), an international maritime treaty which sets minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. The IEC 60092 series, applicable to all electrical installations on board ships, are employed worldwide by naval architects, marine engineering design and consulting companies, ship and offshore unit builders, cable and electrical equipment manufacturers, installers, classification bodies, test houses, ship owners, operators and national and international authorities.\n TC 105 prepares standards for fuel cell technology. It has for instance published IEC 62282‑8‑102, which deals with single cells and stacks with proton exchange membrane. IEC TC 21 prepares standards for batteries and cells, including for the safety of lithium-ion cells used for the propulsion of electric vehicles.\nOne of the four IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems, IECEE (IEC System of CA Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components), has a programme which applies to batteries, chargers and charging stations. They can be tested for safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances and chemicals.\nIECEx (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres) is another IEC CA System. During 2022 and 2023, IECEx ramped up its activities, which have long been dealing with hydrogen safety, with the establishment of a formal cooperation with ISO/TC 197 and the publishing of a standard operating procedure for international IECEx Certification of gaseous hydrogen dispensing equipment and assemblies (IECEx OD 290)."

        "content": "One of the things that makes Artificial intelligence (AI) so powerful is its capacity to solve complex problems. But AI applications are only as good as the data that fuel them.\nKnowledge engineering (KE) involves acquiring knowledge from a range of sources and putting it into a knowledge base. The rapid development of big data, cloud computing and natural language processing has dramatically improved data collection and processing, which has in turn encouraged many organizations to invest more in knowledge-intensive applications, which require KE.\nIn AI systems, effective KE is what enables applications to perform such tasks as diagnosing diseases, evaluating market data to provide financial advice or even power chatbots to offer customer support.\nRecognizing the complexity yet importance of effective knowledge engineering, the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, has just published a standard to help.\nISO/IEC 5392 defines a reference architecture of knowledge engineering that describes roles, activities, constructional layers, components and their relationships amongst themselves and other systems from systemic user and functional views.\nProject editor of ISO/IEC 5392, Ruiqi Li said: “With the growing popularity of knowledge-based systems in finance, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation and other domains, there is a need for a systematic approach for building them, similar to methodologies used in software engineering. This standard provides a common KE vocabulary and defines components, technologies and characteristics of KE to enable effective interoperability and communication between developers, integrators, users and other stakeholders around the world. In this way it creates a solid foundation for its integration into other AI technologies.”\nChair of SC 42 Wael William Diab said: “This standard is one of a portfolio of horizontal standards that can then be used across applications and uses cases. It takes into consideration ethical and societal concern such as safety, security, privacy, transparency and integrity, to ensure and enable broad, responsible adoption of AI.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem. It looks at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight.\nHear more from Wael William Diab about SC 42 in this video.\nThe next workshop will be held on 3 and 4 June. Details coming soon."

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) takes up increasing amounts of space in our lives, yet experts agree that we have only begun to scratch the surface of its innovative power. Healthcare, agriculture and retail are just some of the industries benefiting from AI, and its uses and capabilities are growing exponentially.\nIt is no wonder, then, that governments around the world are debating and introducing rules and regulations in a bid to keep it safe. Responsible development and deployment of AI will enable us to reap the benefits while minimizing the risks.\nThe recently published ISO/IEC 42001 is intended to help an organization develop, provide or use AI systems responsibly through providing guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system. Being a management system standard, it can be certified to, thus providing reassurance to governments and stakeholders that the requirements have been implemented correctly.\nThe new standard is one of a portfolio of standards developed by SC 42 to enable certification and thus quality control in AI.\nThe standard was developed by global experts from industry, government, academia and standardization and already its impact is being felt in many different countries.\nIn Australia, SC 42 work on AI is highly valued, said Aurelie Jacquet, SC42 representative for the country.\n“With SC42 we are developing over 40 standards on AI that cover the data, the models and also organizational governance so it's very exciting work. And in Australia, we are already using this work. The Federal government, in the interim guidance on the use of generative AI it published in July 2023, is already referring to our ISO/IEC standards.”\nAustralia’s National AI Centre has created a Responsible AI Network that is based on 6 pillars and one of this pillars is standards, she added, of which Standards Australia is a member.\nJapanese organizations can also greatly benefit from SC 42 standards on AI because it will offer them a common understanding that will facilitate progress, said Dr Ryoichi Sugimura, head of the SC 42 mirror committee for Japan.\n“Having these foundational standards will enable the Japanese AI industry to go forward more rapidly and effectively,” he said.\nIEC spoke to SC 42 members at a recent plenary meeting in a number of countries to hear how SC 42 standards on AI can help.\nThis includes Australia, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Turkey, UK and USA.\nLearn more about SC 42 from the Chair, Wael William Diab."

        "content": "Consumer choice can drive positive change in industries by demanding social responsibility from their producers. Conscious consumerism can invoke practices like ethical sourcing and sustainable design.\nAccording to a 2022 study, 66% of global consumers rank sustainability in their top five considerations when making a purchase decision. There is plenty of data making it clear that consumers are increasingly favouring sustainable goods. This has driven some companies to be more conscious of their environmental footprint and work on sustainable approaches in response to consumer demand.\nIt is a clear show of the power of consumer choice. But is that enough to push companies to drastically lower their polluting emissions and produce less e-waste?\nBottlenecks to making a sustainable choice\nConsumer demand can influence market trends only to a certain extent. There are several larger issues ranging from the need for government incentives and regulations to international cooperation in policy making. The high price of some sustainable goods might be a factor impacting their choice or the lack of availability of sustainable goods might be another.\nYet another factor is the deleterious effect of exaggerated environmental claims or greenwashing. If the green claims of a brand seem insincere, it is easy for the consumer to lose trust in its products. Consequently, there is a need for more information and clarity on the sustainable practices of a product or a company advertising them.\nInfluence via digital media\nThere are other ways to foster sustainability in the market.  When it comes to creating access and awareness, digital technology can be a huge driver.  \nIn today’s information driven, socially connected world, another key factor is digital influence. Advertising via social media platforms or gaining an edge on recommendations via apps and websites are effective ways of gaining customers. An ethically responsible application could provide environmentally conscious recommendations.\nSome online shopping websites have started suggesting second-hand alternatives for the products the customer is searching for.  Some rate the products on their platform by their degree of sustainability; others rely on verified customer reviews in highlighting different social or environmental impacts of the products.\nBut having access to information isn’t enough, it needs to be trustable. While individual customer reviews can be illuminating, they still are not always a reliable assessment of a product’s quality or other aspects such as sustainable design. How can a market achieve that?\nBuilding trust\nOnce it’s established that a sizeable segment of the market demands sustainable products, often producers compete for attention by highlighting their sustainable practices. However sometimes advertising wars can give way to exaggerated claims. To dispel doubts about sustainability claims from a manufacturer, obtaining certifications from a reliable, independent body proves to be an effective solution. IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System, offers ecodesign certification for products.\nCompanies can use this certification as proof of the veracity of their environmental claims, thus building credibility with customers. Ecodesign focuses on the environmental impacts of a product over its entire life cycle. Introducing environmental considerations into the scope of the design and development process of that product aims to reduce environmental impacts and supports a circular economy.\nGetting this certification enables not only manufacturers, but also consumers, to make a well-informed choice. Simultaneously, they foster competition reliant on best practices for eco-friendly approaches, encouraging other companies to follow suit.\nNeed for more regulations\nProviding verifiable information to help make better choices is not just ethically responsible, it also provides a competitive edge to companies in a market where people prioritize sustainability.\nTo truly facilitate the shift to a global circular economy, there is a need for international cooperation. More should be done in regulations to incentivize manufacturers to embrace sustainable practices and to make more sustainable choices accessible. Such regulations, coupled with consumers choosing sustainable options, can be formidable drivers for a more environmentally conscious market.\n \nYou can explore more about the power of consumer choice in this e-tech article."

A further 40 standards will be published by the end of this year. \nKnown as Commented Versions (CMVs), these publications provide commentary from technical experts on the major changes between the new edition of the standard and the previous one. \nBenefits to users\nCMVs are an enhanced version of the traditional IEC Redline Version (RLV) which highlights the changes between the previous edition and the new edition. With the Commented Versions, users can better understand the rationale for changes made to the newest edition of the standard. Comments may include an explanation for the changes as well as information on the impact of these changes on the application and usability of the standard. \nFeedback from users has been positive. In a survey conducted in 2022, 84% were highly satisfied by the comments of the CMVs and 97% would buy CMVs again in the future.\nAccording to Michelle Andersen, the Convener of the editing committee for IEC Technical Committee 61 responsible for providing the comments, “Users of the standard, such as appliance manufacturers and certification bodies, often have questions about why new requirements or revisions were made to the standards. The greatest benefit of the CMV is that it offers this background information in a concise, easy to access format.”\nShe also notes the ease with which the comments can be accessed. “In the CMV, the comments are linked. This means that the comment appears when hovering over the comment number in the body of the document, making it very easy and intuitive for the user\".\nBenefits to standards developers\nStandards developers have also expressed their satisfaction with the publication of CMVs as it provides a method for capturing the reasons behind the changes to a standard. According to Neil Dennis, Chair of IEC SC 31J, “Sometimes we have to go back many years to understand the reasons for a clause in a standard. By providing additional information and recording historical changes, the CMV provides a mechanism to track changes for future reference.” \nIn a survey of experts having developed CMVs, the feedback has been very positive. All indicated that they would develop CMVs again in the future. They value CMVs for enabling a better understanding and implementation of their standards as well as to giving greater visibility to the Technical Committee work. \nAs Neil Dennis highlights, “Understanding what a standard requires or allows is one thing but understanding WHY is an equally important dimension. If you understand why as well as the background, then following a standard becomes more intuitive and supports users with seeing the intent which can be a huge help in designing installations and equipment.” By helping users, standards developers ensure that standards are implemented correctly.\nStandards available as CMV\nCMVs consist of a package, which includes both the new edition of the publication and the Commented Version. Several of the most widely sold IEC Standards are available as CMVs. They can be purchased from IEC Members, local resellers or from the IEC Webstore."

        "abstract": "A new standard is being developed by a subcommittee of IEC Technical Committee 62, which prepares standards for medical equipment. It ensures the security of radiation sources in hospitals.",
        "content": "When most people think of radioactive materials, nuclear plants and weapons come to mind and we are all aware of the risks relating to both areas. We forget that hospitals around the world use  potentially dangerous radioactive materials to treat illnesses like cancer as well as for disinfection and that these materials need to be stored securely on the hospital premises. Ensuring the security of these sealed radiation sources in a medical environment is the focus of a new standard which is currently being developed by SC 62C, which prepares the benchmarks for equipment used in radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and radiation dosimetry.\nThe standard provides measures for manufacturers regarding physical security but also involves hospitals, asking them to implement the proposed measures and to complement them. It references existing standards dealing with the safety of safes and vaults.\n  “One of the challenges is that hospitals must remain open to the public, they have to stay welcoming and friendly spaces, for both patients and visitors. This means that screening people entering the hospital is not really desirable. More extreme measures, like using armed police to guard the materials, even less so,” explains the Secretary of IEC TC 62 Regina Geierhofer.\nBest to establish proper safety specifications for the locations where these sealed radiation sources will be stored in an international standard. The genesis of IEC 63322 is also prompted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which indicates that “activities such as the medical uses of radiation, the operation of nuclear installations, the production, transport and use of radioactive material, and the management of radioactive waste must be subject to standards of safety.”\nThe intent of the proposed standard is to complement or augment the different specific regulations that cover the security arrangements to safeguard high-activity sealed radiation sources in clinical use.\n“This is a new area of standardization for our TC. Ensuring the security of buildings and rooms has always been more of an ISO prerogative. In this particular case, however, we have decided to use our specific knowledge of radiation protection and combine it with the experience gained with cyber security standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 81001 series).We needed to fill a specific security gap for an area, which lately gets less publicity than cyber security, the physical security of radioactive materials. Experts coming from a wide variety of countries, stretching from the US and several European countries to India, Japan, China and Russia, have collaborated to produce the document,” Regina Geierhofer adds.\nThe standard is now in CDV stage – meaning this is the last stage at which technical comments can be taken into consideration. The committee draft for vote (CDV) is submitted to all IEC National Committees for a 12-week voting period. It is expected that the standard will be published in around a year and half from now.\n."

        "content": "The Smart Grid Forums team decided to organize one big event, which takes place next week, instead of three separate ones during the year. We asked Mandana White, CEO of Smart Grid Forums, to explain why this event is an absolute must for all the smart grid experts out there, from utility managers and standards developers to supplier and vendors.\nWhy decide to regroup all Smart Grid Forums events in one big catch all event, including cyber security?\nWe first co-located three of our events back in 2015, when it became apparent that smart grid technical teams wanted to break out of their silos and gain a working knowledge about related grid domains, to improve their internal collaborations and speed up the pace of grid transformation. At first we co-located our Substation, SCADA Systems, and Utility Telecom events, and this gave utility smart grid technical teams a boost in understanding about related domains and the supplier community more efficient access to the wider utility teams at once. Since then we have added three more tracks on Smart Metering, Big Data and Cyber Security. Next year we will add a further four tracks on Asset Management, IEC 61850, IEC 62443, and IEC Common Information Model (CIM). A total of 10 tracks, giving 10 utility technical teams the opportunity to come together under one roof at one time each year, to support greater collaboration in the industry, and drive faster grid transformation for society\n What would be the main theme of the event if any?\nUniting the power grid ecosystem to speed up the pace of renewables integration under increased regulatory pressure and more intense cybersecurity threat to ensure future energy security for Europe and help support climate goals.\nWhat key topics are likely to be of interest?\nThe plenary sessions address the urgency for more regional cooperation to ensure grid resilience and energy security for Europe. These sessions address the regulatory, workforce, technological and cybersecurity opportunities and challenges that must be navigated effectively. The technical tracks showcase the most innovative grid transformation projects taking place across Europe in the most investment intensive domains: substations, SCADA systems, utility telecom, smart metering, big data, and cyber security. The focus is very much on supporting power grid operators make the best technology choices and drive much faster implementation action to deliver the grid of the future."

        "content": "When women are not present, we need to ask: why not? This was a key theme running through the recent IEC Academy webinar on the vital role that women play in cultivating innovation and progress in the electrotechnical sector.\nHeld on the eve of International Women’s Day (IWD) on 8 March 2024, the webinar featured views, debates and discussions with successful women experts in the industry, focusing on this year’s IWD theme “Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress.”\nModerator Veronica Lancaster, the Vice President of Standards Programs at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) and member of the IEC Board said: “The more we participate in standardization, the more our voices are heard. In 2024 we are still seeing standards that are based on male anatomy and we can only change this by making sure all of our voices are heard.”\nThe need for gender responsive standards was illustrated with the example of the crash test dummy in vehicles. As they are typically designed using male dummies, women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured or die from a car accident than men, and two to three times more likely to have whiplash. Historically, most standards of any kind have also been developed based on a Caucasian man aged 25-30 years old and weighing 70kgs.\nTo address issues like this, IEC together with ISO, published a guidance document providing standards developers and all technical committee and working group participants with important considerations and questions to aid them ensure the standards they develop are gender responsive.\nProfessor Sofia Scataglini is a biomedical engineer and renowned expert in human digital modelling and simulation. An expert in IEC TC 124 (Wearable electronic devices and technologies) she outlined efforts the committee is making to ensure standards help users design products for the end users, including men and women.\n“It is very important we design products for the entire population, whether they are male, female or have a disability, for example. This is what we are trying to do in our standardization, to reduce risks and make them safer for everyone.”\nGiven that women generally make the vast majority of consumer purchasing decisions, gender responsive standards are also highly important when it comes to everyday items such as household appliances.\nIrma Rustemi, Chair of TC 61, the IEC technical committee for household appliances outlined the vast breadth of standards in their portfolio for the safety and performance of 126 products, and the efforts being made to consider women’s physiologies and needs when developing them.\nTest probes, for example, are being expanded to include anatomic specifications based on women as well as men, such as hand size and force when using steam pressure cookers.\n“Our standards work is still largely male-dominated, with a lot of engineers coming from manufacturing, laboratories and regulatory bodies, but we are seeing an increasing number of women participating in the work. And this is important, especially as more and more we are considering gender responsiveness in the standards we develop.”\nThe challenges of women in this male dominated industry were illustrated by Principal Engineer at Panasonic Corporation, Takako Aramaki, such as a scarcity of women in leadership positions, a negative perception of women in the workplace and workplace conditions that are incompatible with parenting that affect women directly.\n“It is crucial to actively promote women and set numerical targets for their appointment, and recognize and celebrate their achievements to change the culture. By promoting women’s rights, leadership can be achieved by changing mindsets and working environments to remove barriers.\n“By increasing opportunities for women to excel and providing the right support, we can accelerate innovation in the field of electrical engineering,” she said.\nBiomedical engineer and Mexico's representative for the IEC Young Professionals Programme in 2022, Diana Rojas pointed out that everything should start with a why.\n“In standardization, we all have a goal in mind, which is safety and efficiency. And we should always start with a why: why are we doing this? But if we have the same people in the room, the response will always be the same. So let’s go and encourage participation from women in every geographical region.”\nProgress is being made – but more needs to be done\nThe webinar also highlighted where progress was being made.\nHead of the Engineering Industries Division/Standardization Department at the Jordanian Standards and Metrology Organization (JSMO) and Secretary of the IEC Jordanian National Committee Fadia Abdel Ghani said gender equity is crucial for the electrotechnical industry in Jordan.\n“In Jordan, and the region in general, women involvement in the electrotechnical sector was uncommon 20 years ago but lately they are becoming known as competent and skilled in both presence and leadership. The industry has adapted to global best practices in response to the increasing emphasis on diversity and inclusion by international organizations. This has improved its standing, drawing in new foreign investments and partnerships, as well as driving innovation, enhancing productivity and ensuring long-term competitiveness in the global marketplace.”\nBut more needs to be done, which is why the value of mentoring was also discussed as an effective and powerful way of increasing women’s participation in the industry.\nClaudia Sirch, Chief Engineer, Global Engineering at the leading Total Quality Assurance provider Intertek and a member of the IECEE Peer Assessment Committee said a lot of effort has been made to encourage women to enter into the electro engineering sphere but many leave early on. Effective mentoring can help to give women confidence to overcome the challenges and progress.\n“I think the key to success in mentoring is to be available and share experiences, and that includes mistakes. You need to get to know them, understand their strengths and weaknesses and then an effective strategy can be developed.”\nThe IEC is committed to improving gender equity in standardization\nIEC Secretary General and CEO Philippe Metzger said trust, inclusion and collaboration are key themes of the IEC global strategy, and are increasingly important to meet the huge challenges ahead of us.\n“Whether it is helping to mitigate climate change or adapting to the digital transformation of our world into all-electric and connected societies, we need the best talent, coming from a variety of perspectives, to prepare our future. We are dedicated to encouraging diversity and favouring more inclusion, moving forward.”\nTo this end, in 2019 IEC signed the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Declaration for Gender Responsive Standards and in 2021 published its own diversity statement, committing to formally recognize diversity at all levels of the IEC.\nThe IEC is committed to help raise awareness of the value of gender diversity with its NCs and stakeholders.

        "content": "Irma Rustemi is the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 61, which prepares standards for the safety of household and simiIar appliances. How does she and her group of experts keep up with tech innovations, as appliances get smarter?\nWhat are the key challenges for TC 61, in coming years?\nKeeping up with the speed of innovation in smart tech. Each year, at each new CES, we see new gadgets we know we will have to standardize at some point in the future! More and more electric appliances are falling under our scope. Our mission is to produce and maintain international standards relating to the safety of household and similar appliances in a manner that is timely, efficient and which keeps pace with modern technology. The standards produced need to respond to the needs of certification bodies, users, manufacturers and national authorities responsible for safety. The requirements aim to facilitate international trade in electrical appliances and to minimize the need for national differences. We are also constantly on the look-out for young experts coming from the AI world as AI is becoming more and more important in our field.\nSince you became Chair in 2022, what are your main priorities for the TC?\nOne of my priorities is for TC 61 to support and advance concepts aligning with gender responsiveness. This includes addressing gender needs in standards proposals and I have established it as a priority consideration for the various groups which are part of TC 61. We responded to the IEC survey on gender responsive standards (GRS), completed the checklist and are using the guidelines from the ISO/IEC joint strategic advisory group on GRS.\nI also want to improve the way we work and make it more efficient. We have a huge portfolio of standards, and our work has to be surgical as we deal with appliances that are used by billions of people around the world. There is no room for errors. IEC TC 61 was founded in 1967 and at the time had a much smaller portfolio of appliances. Things have changed so much and we need to restructure to be able to meet these new challenges.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "abstract": "Interconnectors can help balance the grid supply to counter the intermittency of renewable energies. Learn which other technologies help enable constant electricity supply and how IEC helps.",
        "content": "There are over 400 interconnectors in Europe alone, and several other international and intra-national interconnectors facilitate trading of electricity between regions.\nWhy are they important?\nInterconnectors can prove especially useful when countries are looking to increase their reliance on renewable energy.  Prominent renewable sources like wind and solar energy are intermittent and cannot be relied upon to constantly meet the grid's electricity requirements.  Periods of under-supply can cause fluctuations in the grid, which may result in disruptions and power outages. So, there is a need to balance the grid.\nOne can use industrial-scale battery sites and other storage technologies to support the grid’s electricity supply.\nBut interconnectors can be a cost-effective solution.\nHow do interconnectors work?\nInterconnectors are structures that enable flow of electricity between grids. Besides being used in local areas, they can be scaled up to share energy supplies between countries.\nThe idea revolves around balancing energy supply and demand. When one country faces reduced energy supply, perhaps due to minimal wind activity, it can rely on a shared supply pool, tapping into excess energy from neighbouring countries. Already, countries such as Denmark, Germany and the UK have setup interconnectors to share the supply load from renewable energies with nearby countries.\nBut that’s not the only way to ensure constant supply. Smarter and more flexible grids using advanced energy storage systems and communication technologies are needed to balance supply and demand in real time.\nResearchers have been working on innovative technologies and storage alternatives for grid management and balancing, and there is a growing interest hydrogen storage.\nUsing hydrogen to balance the grid\nBecause hydrogen can be stored, it presents a feasible option to balance grid fluctuations expected from renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. Thanks to reversible fuel cell technology, water can be split through electrolysis to produce hydrogen, as well as convert hydrogen back to electricity. That translates in using the electricity in times of high supply to generate hydrogen gas. The gas can then be stored in containers for long-term usage and used in times of low supply.\nStandards to help\nIEC International Standards together with conformity assessment underpin the entire energy chain, from electricity generation to its use by billions of devices.  They contribute to key standards for smart grid technologies, the communication technologies involved and their integration with existing power grids. IEC also publishes standards relating to batteries for on-grid and off-grid energy storage.\nSpecific committees are also dedicated to preparing standards that contribute to energy storage systems like dealing with standards for fuel-cell technologies for hydrogen. IEC also provides standards for the design, testing and operation of hydraulic machines like turbines, storage pumps and pump turbines which are relevant to another flexible storage solution known as pumped-storage hydropower.  \nMoreover IECEx (the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres) covers the certification for equipment, services and competence of people in areas associated with hydrogen. \n \nExplore the in depth e-tech article to know more about the different technologies that help balance the grid, and how IEC helps."

        "abstract": "While wearables date back to the 16th century, the first computer wearable  was made in the 1950s to cheat the roulette wheel. Wearables have come a long way since. How do they impact our lives now?",
        "content": "Even if ‘smartwatches’ and ‘VR headsets’ have become common terms in the last few decades, wearable technology has been around for much longer. If we consider a broader definition, eyewear with lens correction was already available in the 13th century. In fact, watches and abacus rings can be dated back to as early as the 16th century.\nBetting on a computer wearable\nThings started getting more interesting in the 1950s when the first ‘computer’ wearable was born. Here we shift our focus to devices capable of storing or processing data that could be worn on a person.\nEdward Thorp and Claude Shannon tested out the first wearable, no bigger than a pack of cigarettes out of Shannon’s basement. And what was their project? A betting device to beat the roulette wheel. The wearable version of the computer could be hidden in a shoe and was ready by 1961. By measuring the speed of the roulette wheel’s rotation, its rate of decay and the speed of the ball, they figured out a system to predict where the ball would land. The wearer could use toe-switches to start the device and cleverly, once the device had timed the ball, it transmitted a small sound signal through a speaker in the wearer’s ear.\nThey kept the method and existence of the computer secret until 1966. Although Thorp later published a paper revealing their methodologies and is now credited with having invented the first computer wearable.\nA new discipline\nAround 1977, there was another pioneer devising wearables that were a significant leap from previous devices. Steve Mann, often referred to as the father of wearable computing, focussed on general purpose computer wearables.\nHis work towards several inventions ranging from smartwatch videophones, digital eyeglasses and more, laid the groundwork for modern wearables. While he wasn’t the only one working on wearables, he did help accelerate developments in the domain when he formalized the discipline by founding the MIT Media Lab’s Wearable Computing Project along with Alex Pentland in the 1990s.\nTransforming healthcare\nToday we’ve come a long way from the bulky, albeit trailblazing wearable devices. Nifty, sometimes button-sized, devices have generated a booming industry for portable monitoring and analyses systems.\nHealthcare is one area, where the impact has been significant. Wearables are transforming healthcare because they are easy to use and enable people to monitor their health continuously and on the go. Thanks to smart wearable devices, health monitoring can become part of our daily routine, rather than waiting for that one visit to the doctor or hospital.\nStandards for a safer future\nWith constant technological development, new possibilities with artificial intelligence and the parallel ethical and cybersecurity issues that emerge, international standards can help set safety and performance benchmarks for the devices.\nIEC TC 124 prepares standards for wearable electronic devices and technologies. The latest standards under development precisely focus on heart rate measurements for wearables and measuring step counts.\nOn the issue of cyber security, IEC TR 60601-4-5:2021 provides detailed guidance on adapting a standard primarily centred on industrial communication networks to suit the specific needs of the healthcare sector. Cloud computing is standardized by the joint subcommittee between IEC and ISO, ISO/IEC SC 38 and standards for sensors are produced by IEC TC 47.\nAnother key series of standards is IEC 80001, which helps identify and mitigate potential risks associated with medical devices in a networked environment. \nAs the integration of smart wearable technology in healthcare becomes increasingly prevalent, it is important to take a critical look at the current limitations standing in the way and potential breakthroughs that could take wearables for healthcare to the next level. You can explore this in depth in the e-tech article here.\nLatest advances in the field depends on the integration of devices with various emerging technologies like flexible electronics, big data and cloud computing.\nWith standards helping provide the assurance for a safe and reliable framework, the path ahead lies rife with opportunities for wearables in healthcare."

        "content": "Cyber attacks are not going away any day soon and it is predicted that the cost to the global economy will reach nearly  USD10 trillion this year.\nAdd to that the ongoing shortage of cyber security professionals, and it is more and more important to have measures in place to protect systems and devices from cyber attacks, including mobile devices.\nBiometrics technologies are increasingly being used to identify and authenticate individuals accurately as it uses markers that are unique to the person, such as fingerprints and irises. Yet these, too, can be subject to cyber attacks if sufficient mechanisms and systems are not in place.\nOne of the risks is a presentation attack, where an impersonation of the human characteristic is presented to a biometric capture subsystem, in order to gain access to the system. Presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms are designed to automatically detect presentation attacks so they can be acted on.\nISO/IEC 30107-3 is the widely recognized international standard that establishes principles and methods for performance assessment of PAD mechanisms and for reporting the results.\nRecognizing that PAD mechanisms are commonly integrated into mobile devices that use biometrics, and that they have their own specific requirements, ISO/IEC 30107-4 was developed. The international standard has just been updated to reflect the latest technologies and practices.\nISO/IEC 30107-4 provides requirements for assessing the performance of PAD mechanisms on mobile devices with local biometric recognition.  It lists the requirements from ISO/IEC 30107-3 that are specific to mobile devices.\nA key update is the addition of Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) biometrics and requirements. FIDO is a set of security specifications for strong authentication developed by the FIDO Alliance whose mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. The FIDO Alliance promotes the development and use of standards for authentication and device attestation.\nISO/IEC 30107-4 is one of a series of standards for PAD developed by the joint ISO and IEC committee for biometrics standards, SC 37.\nOthers in the series include ISO/IEC 30107-1, which provides a framework through which presentation attack events can be documented and analyzed to enhance decision making; ISO/IEC 30107-2 which defines data formats for conveying the mechanism used as well as results of biometric PAD and ISO/IEC 30107-3 for testing and reporting.\nSC 37 has developed over 130 international standards, with many more in development, to support interoperability and data interchange among applications and systems.\nThe committee also monitors factors that influence biometric technologies such as cyber security and ethical or cross jurisdictional and societal aspects."

        "content": "Thanks to the Internet of Things, smart homes are on the rise, with the global market size projected to grow to over USD$330 billion by 2030. This is promising news for the environment, because a smart home – one where appliances and devices can be automatically controlled remotely - can also help to reduce carbon emissions through greater efficiencies and creating wiser energy consumption habits.\nSmart homes also produce large amounts of data, which, if used wisely, can contribute to the development of further solutions that reduce emissions even more.\nIt is this kind of data that has enabled city leaders to see that some services are better managed at the region or neighbourhood level, rather than centralising everything which has often been the case. Shorter distances and services better tailored to the neighbourhood’s needs can result in increased efficiencies and reduced energy consumption.\nThe 15-minute city is one example of how focusing on local neighbourhoods and districts is important for managing cities and making them more liveable. The idea is that city services are accessible to citizens within a 15-minute walk or cycle, thus reducing emissions from transport.  \nThe concept of Positive Energy Districts (PED) is another approach to city management that follows this idea. The aim is to take a whole-system approach to moving to net zero within a city district, with the ultimate goal of producing more energy than is consumed, largely from renewable sources. The objective is to accelerate the decarbonization of urban areas and foster the scalability potential across cities.\nTo develop a Positive Energy District, many issues need to be considered, including increasing the use of locally sourced renewable energy, moving to more sustainable local transport and supporting residents to reduce unnecessary use of energy. The smart home is a key contributor to this, if it uses renewable energies such as biomass and solar power for heating, energy efficient appliances and smart technology to help with better energy management.\nFor this to work, however, the interoperability of smart home technologies is necessary so that data can be shared between them in a well-managed way to provide a clear overall picture of how energy is being generated and used throughout the district.\nIEC Systems Committee (SyC) for smart cities is currently exploring the concept to help determine what standards are needed to help the development of Positive Energy Districts.\nLearn more in the latest edition of e-tech."

        "abstract": "OLED, QLED or Mini-LED…What technology will prevail for the screens we are so addicted to?",
        "content": "Different technologies are competing to replace liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, which are on the decline.  In this article, we offer a guide to the main ones.\nThe key difference between LCD and organic LED technology is that OLEDs do not use a backlight layer to illuminate the screen pixels. Instead, OLED pixels emit light when power is applied to them. This means that OLED screens can be made about 30% thinner and lighter than LCD screens.\nOLEDs are however more expensive to produce and have typically struggled to offer ultimate brightness while burn-in (a ghostly afterimage left on the screen following heavy use) remains an issue on older models. \nOne response to these challenges is phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) blue. Phosphorescent materials are far more efficient at converting light and are currently used for the red and green colour emitters in OLED displays while fluorescent is the standard for blue emitters. The display industry has been waiting for more efficient blue phosphorescent materials and at least one company claims to have made a breakthrough in this regard with new red, green and blue PHOLED products on sale later this year.\nMini LED is a more affordable rival technology to OLED which is applied to LCD screens. It uses tiny LEDs to create smaller, more flexible dimming zones. This technology is also less susceptible to burn-in. For context, a giant mini LED TV screen with 10 000 nits of brightness has just been unveiled. A nit is a unit of measurement that relates to the brightness level of visible light (luminance) within a specific area and is typically used to measure screen brightness.\nOLED faces most competition from QLED technology. The Q stands for quantum dot, a technology pioneered by one vendor but now used in several brands. The quantum dots, also known as nanocrystals, are the tiny semiconductor particles that boost colour vibrancy and image control. The problem is that the quantum dots used in current QLED screens rely on light from a backlight, in just the same way that an LCD layer does on standard LCD screens. This limits the effectiveness of the semiconductor particles.\nSelf-emissive QLEDs could be the answer. These uses photoluminescent quantum dots with the ability to light up and turn off individual pixels rather than using a backlight. In theory, this would give screens using self-emissive QDs all the advantages of OLED but with greater vibrancy and in a form that can be manufactured at lower cost.\nThe IEC publishes most of the important standards relating to display screens. IEC Technical Committee 110 prepares standards for electronic displays, whether LED, OLED, holographic and more. The IEC 61747 series specifies the requirements for LCDs , while the IEC 62341 series does the same for OLED screens.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "Earlier this month, I was honoured to take part in a conference on artificial intelligence (AI) hosted by the European standards development organization, ETSI. It was an important opportunity to present the work of SC 42 and to discuss not only how our work aligns with Europe’s keenly anticipated AI Act, but also with governance frameworks being developed in other parts of the world.\nWhile regulations are mandatory, the standards we produce in the joint IEC and ISO committee on AI are voluntary. They foster collaboration and cooperation among a broad range of stakeholders because they are reached by consensus. There was a question from the audience about how closely our standards are aligned with the needs of Europe. In reality, the diversity and inclusivity of the ISO/IEC process means that we are aligned with the needs of stakeholders all over the world — Africa, Asia, the Americas and Oceania too, not just Europe. \nSC 42 is playing a crucial role in developing international standards to facilitate the responsible adoption of AI technologies across various sectors. We have adopted an ecosystem approach that considers regulatory, industry, developer, user, deployer, societal and ethical perspectives in order to develop comprehensive standards that can be applied universally. \nIt is an approach that has its roots in what the father of standardization, Charles Le Maistre, called \"the community of interest of producer and consumer\". Le Maistre, a founder of the IEC who also played an important role in creating ISO, believed that the collaborative development of mutually agreed-upon technical solutions ensured that standards were both technically robust and socially acceptable.\nA key focus of our work is on creating international standards that enable trustworthy digital transformation. Because SC 42 standards are developed with an ecosystem and platform approach they support and facilitate application domain standards. We have published foundational standards on concepts, terminology, governance and frameworks for AI using machine learning, for example. We have also developed a series of foundational standards for big data.\nWe have also developed a suite of standards that address emerging issues, including explainability, controllability, transparency, robustness, bias, oversight of AI systems, application of risk management frameworks and functional safety in AI systems. There is plenty more in the pipeline.\nPlacing societal needs such as sustainability, transparency, trustworthiness and ethical considerations at the heart of our work can help unlock AI's full potential. It ensures responsible adoption while simultaneously unlocking the societal benefits that AI technology and innovation can bring globally. \nA good example is the recently published standard known as ISO/IEC 42001. It helps organizations of all types and sizes to develop and use AI systems responsibly by giving guidance on establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system. The fact that it is a management system standard means that it is designed to facilitate certification. This gives additional reassurance to stakeholders that the requirements have been implemented correctly.\nWe strive to integrate ethical and societal considerations into all deliverables, in addition to a standalone publication on AI ethics. We are currently working on a new technical specification offering guidance on addressing societal concerns and ethical considerations. We also recognize the fundamental importance of collaboration and have built an extensive network of over 50 partnerships with organizations like UNESCO, OECD and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as the European Commission.\nI told the ETSI conference that ISO/IEC international standards are essential for overcoming barriers to AI adoption while addressing ethical, societal and technical concerns. And I invited the participants to join our next AI workshop. Our bi-annual online workshops provide a platform for dialogue and information exchange on emerging trends, technology and international standards in the AI ecosystem. You are invited too."

        "content": "The market for household appliances continues to grow, and the internet of things is fuelling its growth. It is also giving rise to products and systems more complex. Which is all the more reason why safety needs to come first.\nSafety first\nConnected appliances provide lots of advantages. There are ovens and robots that can be programmed to have dinner ready when you get home or put the washing on or clean the floor. But being connected is no guarantee that something won’t go wrong. Appliances still need built-in safety features such as anti-jam functions on toasters or auto-shutoff mechanisms if the product gets too hot or malfunctions.\nInternational standards play a significant role in appliance safety as they provide globally agreed technical specifications and requirements designed to ensure a minimum level of performance and safety.\nThe IEC 60335 series of standards is the international reference for ensuring safety in household appliances.\nThe series covers a long list of household appliances including refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, hairdryers, microwave ovens and the humble toaster. Yet the principle behind the standards remains the same: that the product functions as it should, and safely.\nCyber security a key priority\nIncreased connectivity means increased risks of cyber attacks which can manipulate functions such as temperature limits that are designed to keep you safe.\nWhich is why IEC 60335 was also updated to include new cyber security requirements. The intention is to safeguard against unauthorized access and its potential consequences on user safety.\nBut standards are only one part of the equation. As technology and thus safety requirements become more complex, so too does the demand for evidence of safety rise.\nThe importance of conformity assessment\nIECEE is the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment. It offers the IECEE HOUS Certification Body Test Certificate (CBTC) Scheme for household appliances to provide such evidence. The scheme works whereby the IECEE national certification body (NCB) arranges that a registered and qualified CB testing laboratory (CBTL) carries out the relevant tests based on the applicable IEC Standards and issues a test report. This is then reviewed and validated by the NCB who then issues a CBTC.\nThe adoption of the IEC 60335 series and the recognition and implementation of the IECEE HOUS CBTC provides a high degree of assurance to national authorities that these appliances are safe. It also helps to prevent counterfeit or low-quality products being imported and/or coming on the market.\nLearn more in the latest issue of e-tech."

        "content": "The war in Ukraine has made countries conscious of the need to secure their energy supply. Renewed fears of cyber attacks on critical assets, such as energy supply systems, is high on the agenda of European facilities, especially. According to an article in Politico, thousands of cyber attacks have affected Europe's energy grid since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A recent report from the International Energy Agency found the average number of cyber attacks against utilities each week more than doubled between 2020 and 2022 worldwide.\nThe IEC is looking at creating a conformity assessment (CA) scheme to certify renewable energy systems connected to the transmission and distribution power systems for their cyber security.\n“Renewable energy providers are acutely aware of the risks of cyber attacks. In the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems, we are looking at how best to implement a cyber security scheme for renewable energy systems,” IECRE Chief Alistair Mackinnon confirms. IECRE is the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\nCyber security standards for the smart grid\nAccording to Frances Cleveland, who leads efforts on cyber security for the grid inside IEC Technical Committee 57, which publishes core standards for the smart grid: “Cyber security is needed everywhere in the electricity grid, including distribution systems, transmission systems, and the renewable energy resources connected to them. We need to convince all the different stakeholders involved and there are many of them, from the manufacturers, the vendors, the installers, right down to the aggregators and the utility regulators, of that necessity,” Cleveland says.\nThe group she leads in TC 57 has developed the IEC 62351 series of standards which provides cyber security requirements as well as guidance on designing security into systems and operations before building them, rather than applying security measures after the systems have been implemented. Some of the different security objectives of these cyber security requirements include authentication of data transfer through digital signatures, ensuring only authenticated access, prevention of eavesdropping, prevention of playback and spoofing, and intrusion detection.\n“The idea is to get distributed energy resources (DER) stakeholders, which include renewable energy companies, to manufacture and interconnect these DER systems with integrated cyber security policies and technologies built-in right from the start, in other words DER systems that are secure-by-design. If they think about cyber security once the system is already out there, it will be a bit like applying a band aid to a life-threatening injury,” Cleveland says.\nRenewable energy systems, the weak link?\nThe connection of renewable energy operators to the power grid makes it likely that they will become cyber targets, especially because they involve many different stakeholders with limited cyber security expertise and because the DER systems usually utilize the public Internet for communications. Threat actors using sophisticated technology increasingly are looking for vulnerabilities in the operational technology (OT) of organizations that may not be part of the electric power system but connect to it. Attackers focus on “weak links in the chain” that may not have invested adequately in the security of their OT environment and renewable energy systems are sometimes perceived to be those weak links.\nAccording to CohnReznick, a tax and assurance consultancy firm, new companies in the renewables sector may not have a chief information security officer, or that role may report to another company officer. However, the cyber security risk is so pervasive that they strongly advise renewable energy companies to have a competent security officer with enough autonomy to implement policies, practices, and controls necessary to protecting not only the IT and OT environments, but also the operational continuity, financial stability, and reputation of the company. This is just one of the recommendations that could be part of a new IEC Conformity Assessment cyber security service for renewable energy systems.\n \"The key to a comprehensive and successful cyber security service for renewable energy systems will be to leverage the experience from the IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme and the in-depth knowledge of IECRE experts related to Renewable Energy Systems. With the cooperation of both groups, we can develop a service of high market relevance which brings true added value for all stakeholders,” says the Executive Secretary of IECRE and IECEE Wolfram Zeitz. IECEE is the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components.\n Read the full article in e-tech."

It also featured discussions and presentations around how AI can help address many of the world’s challenges, as well as concerns around ethics, privacy, trust and risk.\nGiven how widespread AI is and the rate at which it is evolving, global harmonization of terminologies, best practice and understanding is important to enable the technology to be deployed safely and responsibly. IEC and ISO International Standards fulfil that role and are thus important tools to enable AI technologies to truly benefit society. They can not only provide a common language for the industry, they also enable interoperability and provide international best practice, while addressing any risks and societal issues.\nAmid all the high-tech hype, AI regulation was also a key topic, recognizing that governments around the world are looking at implementing legislation to keep its citizens safe.\nInternational standards are key tools to enabling widespread adoption of AI technologies, in a safe and responsible way. The recently published ISO/IEC 42001 is the first international management system standard for AI that can be certified to. It is intended to help organizations develop, provide or use AI systems responsibly. It is also expected to help demonstrate compliance with current and future legislation around AI, such as the EU AI Act.\nDeveloped by the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, the standard is part of a portfolio that cover the who, what, where, when and how of AI, with new areas and issues constantly being explored.\nLearn more in the latest issue of e-tech."

        "abstract": "IEC and ISO Standards are paving the way for the latest technology advances in speech recognition.",
        "content": "Alexa and Siri are words we use daily and have become nearly as familiar as the names of people in our entourage. While we were all initially wowed by these artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools, when they first launched, frustration was also part of our day-to-day experience, as these voice-activated assistants struggled to understand basic commands and either asked us to repeat our sentence or simply admitted they did not understand what we were asking.\nFast progress thanks to AI\nFast forward a few years and the picture could not be more different. Machine learning algorithms based on huge streams of data from everywhere in the world have perfected these tools. They now recognize different accents and can be trained to recognize the voice of the person using them. Natural language processing has become a well-recognized branch of AI, focusing on the understanding of human speech.\nSpeech recognition software has been integrated into multiple consumer electronics devices used in the home, from smart lights to dishwashers or fridges. Screens, from television to game consoles, equipped with these tools, are a hugely growing market.\nOne of the much-used applications for speech recognition is to help people who are visually impaired to write using their voice. AI tools enable their voice to dictate a letter without using the keyboard. Using a speech-to-text software system, users talk to the computer and their input is interpreted and converted to electronic text. This is a growing application in our ageing societies, as an increasing number of elderly people have difficulties to write or use a keyboard. \nIn-car speech recognition is another application for the software. As we prepare to use self-driving automobiles, voice issued commands are becoming ubiquitous inside the car and enable us to control vehicles without using our hands. In the future, other means of transportation, from trains to aircraft, are expected to use speech recognition.\nRecognizing emotions\nAnother path, moving forward, is speech emotion recognition (SER). An article published in Science direct, which examines SER and proposes a way of detecting these emotions, explains that “universally, emotions can be often categorized and grouped into mere types like anger, happiness or sadness. One can then use these as a criterion to develop a system. Then through proper training and procedure, the system can be made to recognize the speaker’s emotional state.”\nThe IEC has been paving the way for these AI tools to be used safely and efficiently. The joint committee formed between the IEC and ISO to address IT related issues, ISO/IEC JTC 1, includes several subcommittees (SCs) which publish standards that are relevant. The ISO/IEC 30122 series of standards published by ISO/IEC SC 35 standardizes the criteria required for speech recognition. ISO/IEC 30122‑3, for instance, defines the principal standardized voice commands that will be commonly used in various IT devices and deals with the issues concerning multilingualism of voice commands, as well as speech impairment. ISO/IEC SC 35 has also set up a working group on affective computing. The technology allows for the use of chatbots and virtual assistants that have the ability to transform emotions into data. Published by ISO/IEC SC 42, which prepares standards in relation to AI, ISO/IEC TS 4213 specifies methodologies for measuring classification performance of machine learning models, systems and algorithms.\nThe IEC Systems Committee for active assisted living (AAL), the IEC SyC AAL, prepares standard for devices that enable usability and accessibility of AAL systems and services, including alarms, robots, wearables and speech recognition.\n Read the full article in e-tech."

Ensuring they perform as expected in a safe way is crucial, particularly when they are used in safety-critical functions. A new international standard to help developers evaluate the quality of AI systems has just been published.\nISO/IEC TS 25058 provides guidance for the evaluation of AI systems using an AI system quality model, including specific measures and metrics.\nIt is based on the methodologies outlined in a number of well-adopted ISO/IEC standards for software quality, known as SQuaRE (Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation) standards. They cover various aspects such as requirements, design, testing, maintenance, and evaluation.\nWael William Diab, who chairs SC 42, the IEC and ISO committee on AI said: “Ensuring a minimum level of quality and performance will help to not only improve AI technologies but foster trust and responsible adoption.”\nOlivier Blais, Project Editor of ISO/IEC TS 25058 said the standard is a very concrete guide that empowers AI developers and users to effectively evaluate the quality of their AI systems.\n“It is an essential tool in the AI industry, ensuring that AI systems meet the highest standards of quality and reliability,” he said.\nThe new technical specification covers more than 18 characteristics required to evaluate AI systems. This includes functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, portability, effectiveness and risk mitigation.\nIt is intended to complement the SQuaRE quality evaluation process described in ISO/IEC 25040 for AI systems.\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem. It looks at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards.

        "content": "IEC’s vision to create a safer, more efficient world gained further momentum recently with the launch of a new project supported by the IEC Global Impact Fund (GIF).\nDiffer Community Power (DCP), an international provider of solar energy services to communities, has been selected to determine the feasibility of using second life lithium batteries to rehabilitate solar PV installations at critical locations such as schools, health centres and hospitals in Kenya. The project is estimated to improve the lives of up to 160 000 rural Kenyans through enabling reliable, clean sources of electricity.\nAccess to electricity is a significant problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has an overall electrification rate of under 50%. Batteries are seen as a key solution to this problem, yet they are expensive and complicated to maintain, resulting in significant amounts of waste.\nExisting and previous public and private funding for electrification of critical social infrastructure has focused more on capital than operational expenditure. This has meant that most solar PV systems installed become inoperable within a few years and do not receive end-of-life management or repair.\nFor most of these systems, the batteries are the component that needs replacing, as most of the other components have a lifespan of more than ten years. Enabling the reuse of the batteries, therefore, enables the reuse of the entire solar PV plant.\nWith support from the IEC-GIF, DCP will produce second-life batteries that can be used to rehabilitate five solar PV installations, with three other facilities rehabilitated using new batteries to act as a control study. The batteries will undergo safety and performance testing in line with state-of-the art international standards.\nThe project will also be used as an opportunity to train local subcontractors on wiring regulations and commissioning procedures aligned to international standards. Real time remote monitoring of performance and environmental factors will inform the technical and economic feasibility analyses.\nPhilippe Metzger, Secretary-General and CEO of the IEC, said: “Signing of this project with DCP is an exciting step for the IEC Global Impact Fund. It will allow developing countries to directly benefit from global best practices contained in IEC standards and conformity assessment. This facilitates the interconnection, integration and interoperability of technologies as well as ensuring their safety and efficiency.”\nKjetil Roine, CEO of DCP said: “Off-grid solar (OGS) technologies provide life-changing access to modern energy services for communities that don’t have electricity, but the batteries that run them are most likely to fail first. The support from the IEC Global Impact Fund is a valuable opportunity to develop a sustainable way to re-use the natural resources in batteries without a negative impact on the environment.”\n“What’s more, the data created from the project can help further improve relevant standards, which in turn will allow this technology to grow. The result is that more communities can reap the many benefits from electrification while at the same time contributing to climate change mitigation.”\nThe project will run as a two-year pilot, with support from IEC national contacts, and will be actively seeking scalability and additional partners.\nAbout IEC\nThe IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that brings together 174 countries and coordinates the work of 30 000 experts globally. IEC International Standards and conformity assessment work underpins international trade in electrical and electronic goods. It facilitates electricity access and verifies the safety, performance and interoperability of electric and electronic devices and systems, including for example, consumer devices such as mobile phones or refrigerators, office and medical equipment, information technology, electricity generation, and much more.\nConformity assessment refers to any activity that determines whether a product, system, service and sometimes people fulfil the requirements and characteristics described in a standard or specification. Such requirements can include performance, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, durability, or environmental impacts such as pollution or noise. Verification is generally done through testing and/or inspection.\nAbout the IEC Global Impact Fund\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund advances the IEC vision for a safer and more efficient world by supporting projects that address many of today’s social, economic and environmental challenges, including through the use of IEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nThrough its partnership model, the Fund will help drive the need for a coordinated, consensus-driven approach to electrification while avoiding the fragmentation that perpetuates barriers to the green energy transition.\nIt is initially supported through a three-year annual contribution of 1% of the IEC Capital & Reserves over the 2023-2025 pilot phase. This seed funding will build a global partnership aligned with the IEC values and mission.\nFor questions and further information please contact:\nMatthew Doherty\nSenior Advisor and Officer\nEmail: globalimpactfund@iec.ch"

Conformity assessment systems determine whether a product, service, or process complies with specified standards. Standardization, as a broader concept, provides a common language and framework for all sectors, fostering interoperability, efficiency, safety, and overall quality.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment systems form the foundational basis for the policies and regulations that unpin the SDGs. Aspirations to achieve a just energy transition, quality health and education for all, efforts to achieve net zero and addressing the complex, interconnected challenges embedded in the SDGs, cannot be realized without a structured and cohesive international standards framework. \nInternational standards, representing a global consensus of state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise, play a crucial role in guiding policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring the coordination and effectiveness of global efforts. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), alongside partner institutions like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), are the custodians of this system.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund is a proactive initiative advancing the vision of a safer and more efficient world, showcasing the impact of standardization in addressing contemporary social, economic, and environmental challenges. This initiative underscores the importance of technology and quality infrastructure in positively impacting society.\nThrough a diverse portfolio of projects and collaborative partnerships, the IEC Global Impact Fund actively links and integrates the global standardization framework with the SDGs and the development finance architecture. A call to action is extended to UN Member States, Observers, representatives of UN entities, civil society, and other non-state actors to engage and partner with the international standards system through the Global Impact Fund.

A smart city uses technology to improve services, sustainability, resilience and the quality of life of its citizens. Smart urban planning plays a crucial role.\nYet cities are complex systems of systems and no one size fits all. For this reason, the IEC Systems Committee (SyC) for smart cities is developing a collection of use cases with analysis on smart urban planning. Part one of this standard, recently published, provides a high-level analysis for smart city planners and stakeholders seeking a better understanding of the requirements for smart urban planning.\nIEC SRD 63320-1 explains the definition, development goals, and theoretical models of use case collection and analyses for smart urban planning. It identifies the key application areas and stakeholders involved, outlining the relationships among them through the guidance of a use case template.\nThis document encompasses various aspects of urban planning, including the steps, models, characteristics and technologies used. It also presents an approach for the collection and analysis of use cases. Key benefits of the standard include:\n\nFacilitating stakeholders in fostering a consensus on the notion of astute urban planning.\nExtracting the usefulness and effectiveness of innovative technologies from a multitude of globally integrated cases.\nExploring interactive relationships among governments, businesses, the public, and planning technology groups in different cases.\nA practical reference framework for smart city planning worldwide.\n\nIt is the first in the series of documents that will establish the foundation for collecting and analyzing use cases. These will then help to identify any gaps in standards for smart urban planning, paving the way for them to then be developed.\nThe IEC SRT 63320 series is one of many collections of use cases for various applications related to smart cities developed by SyC Smart Cities. The SyC collaborates with IEC technical committees and other standards development organizations to understand the needs of cities and how standards can help. \nVice chair of SyC Smart Cities Nand Kishor Narang said use cases provide valuable insights into cities that can be used to plan and improve other cities in a wide range of application areas.\n “Understanding the needs of cities and discerning what works and what doesn’t is an important step in empowering them to progress, evolve, and better meet their needs in a sustainable way,” he said.\nWang Feifei, project leader of IEC SRT 63320 said: “In today's rapidly developing cities, traditional urban planning tools face challenges in promptly meeting urban needs. The emergence of smart cities brings new perspectives and tools to urban planning. Through this work we are trying to establish which new tools to use, as well as when and how to use them in the most effective way.\"\nIEC SRD 63320-1 is one of many guidance documents on use cases related to smart cities developed by SyC Smart Cities. Other examples include IEC SRD 63273 (city information modeling), with many more currently under development, encompassing areas such as the management of public health emergencies, water systems, and intelligent operations centers."

It brought together leaders from key international organizations as well as standardization, conformity assessment (CA) and industry experts to share insights on global initiatives that contribute. It was moderated by Gabriela Ehrlich, IEC Director of Communications.\nJaidev Dhavle, Associate Programme Officer at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said there was increasing recognition worldwide that renewable energy is imperative to reducing carbon emissions.\n“A key focus of our work is engaging with stakeholders to understand the barriers to adopting clean energy and identify solutions. To do this we work a lot with international organizations such as the IEC.”\nMarco Matteini, from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), outlined how a key element of their mission was to promote and support the shift from fossil fuels to low carbon energy sources. This includes supporting low carbon supply chains and infrastructures such as green ports, and initiatives to help startups and SMEs bring innovative ideas in energy efficiency to life.\n“In all our programmes, international standards play a critical role. We also undertake activities to support conformity assessment activities which are also very important. For example, we have a programme to build the capacity of laboratories in Africa to test and verify energy efficiency and performance of household appliances,” he said.\nEsther Ngari, Managing Director of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) shared how KEBS is using IEC International Standards and IEC CA Systems to increase cost-effectiveness, reduce barriers to trade, improve market quality, increase knowledge sharing through active participation and get access to global knowledge transfer.\nIncreased access to clean energy is one of the many ways Kenya benefits, she said.\n“The partnership with KEBS and IEC CA Systems is about building a brighter future for Kenya through embracing standardization and conformity assessment.’\nThe Executive Secretaries of the four IEC CA Systems, Wolfram Zeitz and Chris Agius gave overviews of how CA contributes to the safe and efficient development and running of clean energy infrastructures, and support new technologies to emerge.\n“International standards set the requirements for how certain technologies can be operated safely and efficiently in multiple markets,” said Zeitz.\n“The IEC CA Systems are the only example where the same set of requirements are applicable all across the world. Emerging economies can benefit greatly as they can adopt already-designed concepts that are accepted worldwide.”\nGreen hydrogen currently represents just a tiny percentage of overall hydrogen production but with international collaboration the offering can be significantly developed and contribute to the clean energy transition, said Agius.\n“Not only do we have a huge suite of standards to help develop the green hydrogen industry, but we also work closely with other international partners to ensure that testing and certification of materials, services, infrastructures and personnel meet agreed standards for safety and performance,” he said.\nMarine energy expert Johnathan Colby highlighted the opportunity that standardization and CA in this nascent field can offer.\n“Marine energy is seen as a largely untapped resource and its potential is far from realized. Standards and CA will enable the industry to grow and develop safely and efficiently, and also provide opportunities for experts in this field to help shape its future.”\nStandardization is also playing an important role in ensuring the stability of national electricity grids as fossil fuels reduce and renewable energies increase, he added.\n“A dedicated IEC committee for grid integration of renewable energy generation  develops standards to make grids more resilient as more and more renewable energy technologies come online.”\nThe webinar was the first in a new series by IEC Academy that take a deep dive into the IEC CA Systems.\nWatch the replay.\nLearn more about IEC Academy free public webinars."

Over 160 IEC technical committees develop standards that contribute to clean energy systems including for hydropower, marine-, solar-, and wind power, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and nuclear energy.\nFor example, the IEC develops around 200 standards for photovoltaic (PV) components such as modules, inverters, trackers, connectors and DC cables. It also produces standards for PV systems design including quality management systems for the construction of PV power plants and their inspection and testing.\nThe IEC 62257 series for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification has been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). In 2013, together with the IEC, they announced a new cooperative agreement offering a discounted price for qualified stakeholders, thus enabling developing countries greater access to these important technical documents.\nCertification is key\nIECRE (the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) is the internationally accepted CA system for the renewable energy industry.\nThe system aims to facilitate the international trade of equipment and services in the marine (ME), solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy sectors, while maintaining the required level of safety. Each of these sectors will be able to operate IECRE schemes that cover products, services and personnel, to provide testing, inspection and certification.\nIECEE (the IEC System of CA Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) runs a programme that offers access to qualified testing laboratories for the certification of PV components and modules in accordance with the relevant IEC Standards.\nThese certificates demonstrate that all the elements and components are designed, manufactured and tested according to IEC International Standards, meaning they comply with quality and safety requirements worldwide. In this way, they help to support governmental initiatives and incentives, which are crucial to meeting climate targets.\nToday also marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The IEC is a knowledge and ecosystem partner of IRENA’s global Alliance for Industry Decarbonization (AFID) and the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance (UNEZA).\nWhat’s more, in an ongoing close collaboration with IRENA, IECEx (the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmosphere) is contributing to developing a future roadmap for quality infrastructure for clean hydrogen production.\nIECEx oversees the compliance with international standards that address hydrogen safety, and its certification continues to be a valuable tool for facilitating trade at national levels and across international markets.\nThe need for collaboration\nAs the IEC President Jo Cops states in his International Day of Clean Energy message, we cannot do this alone. “The challenges we face are too significant and too complex for any one organization to solve on its own. We need collaboration and partnerships across society and industries. We need to work together to develop a comprehensive approach to decarbonization, sustainability, security and resilience.”\nWebinar to mark the day\nTo celebrate the first International Day of Clean Energy, the IEC Academy held an informative public webinar that looked at current and future solutions to achieving a just and inclusive transition to clean energy and the role of international collaboration, standards and CA.\nWatch the replay\nHear from IEC Vice President, Vimal Mahendru, about how IEC standards contribute to the goals of the International Day of Clean Energy."

Hassle-free but not intrinsically safe, as in most cases, no driving license is required for the user.\nWhile safe driving is an issue, another is the safety of the electronics used to power the device. IEC TC 125 was recently established to develop standards for electrically powered transport devices with one or more wheels, where the speed or steering is controlled electronically. In IEC terminology, these are called e-Transporters. They include electric scooters and monocycles, but exclude electric bicycles, motor bikes or cars since they are already addressed by other technical committees both in the IEC and ISO.\nThe committee is about to publish one of its very first standards, IEC 63281-2-1, which establishes safety requirements and test methods for personal e-Transporters. It follows in the footsteps of its first publication dedicated to terminology.\nIEC TC 125 Standards will include but are not limited to:\n• electrical and mechanical safety;\n• performance and durability;\n• functional safety;\n• EMC;\n• maintenance, repair and recycling;\n• power exchange infrastructure including docking stations and storage systems."

        "content": "Artificial intelligence is perhaps the most revolutionary technology of our time, transforming industries including healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, finance and much more.  The global market for AI is expected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030, with tools that can improve everything from medical diagnoses to productivity, customer service, disaster management and the weather forecast.\nBut concerns such as trust, ethics and transparency of AI systems remain. It is important then that developers and other stakeholders have a common understanding about what the applications really are, where roles and responsibilities lie and the impact that they have.  A new international standard to guide the industry has just been published to help.\nISO/IEC 5339 is the first standard that AI application developers should look at when developing AI applications. It provides guidance on identifying the context, opportunities and processes for developing and applying AI applications, including identifying stakeholders and their roles, responsibilities and expectations, their relationship to the life cycle of the system and common AI application characteristics. The standard will enhance understanding of AI applications, allowing for improved communication and a better outcome for AI users.\nDeveloped by the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, ISO/IEC 5339 is part of a portfolio of standards that cover the who, what, where, when and how of AI, including AI systems life cycle, their use and their impact. It is a strong starting point on which other standards by the committee can then be used, such as ISO/IEC 5338 (life cycle processes), ISO/IEC TR 24028 (trustworthiness), ISO/IEC 23894 (risk management), ISO/IEC 38507 (governance) and the ISO/IEC 5259 series on data quality.\nProject editor for ISO/IEC 5339 Shrikant Bhat said the standard can help to build trust in AI applications by having everyone on the same page.\n“AI applications are new and constantly evolving, so it is important to have a clear understanding of the context, the opportunities, the processes and the impact they have in order to develop effectively and responsibly.”\nConvenor of the working group that developed the standard, Dr Fumihiro Maruyama said: “This standard will provide all stakeholders with a macro level view of the application to promote communication, engagement and acceptance for everyone, including the end user.”\nChair of the SC 42, Wael William Diab said by looking at the AI ecosystem from the point of view of AI application developers, this standard enables broad responsible adoption across application domains.\n “This novel approach ties in the portfolio of standards SC 42 and is an essential go-to standard to assist AI application developers.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem. It looks at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight."

        "content": "The benefits of AI are growing across a large number of areas such as healthcare, transport and manufacturing and more. But issues of trust arise when they are used in safety-critical domains such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles, aviation and industrial control systems.\nEnsuring the safety of AI technologies for these markets, therefore, is essential.\nFunctional safety is a discipline that aims to ensure systems, equipment and devices operate as intended. Functional safety standards are important for any industry where systems could potentially cause harm to people, property or the environment if they fail.\nIEC produces standards aimed at functional safety such as the widely used  IEC 61508 series of standards which cover the design and implementation of safeguards to prevent accidents and minimize risks across various industries.\nHowever, these do not take into account specific domains where AI plays a role.\nUp until now, there has been little guidance regarding the specification, design, and verification of functionally safe AI systems, or how to apply AI technology for functions that have safety-related effects.\nISO/IEC TR 5469 is a new technical report that is designed to fill that vital gap. Its use will help enable the development of safety-related systems using AI technologies by fostering awareness of the properties, functional safety risk factors, available functional safety methods and potential constraints of AI technologies.\nIt will serve as the foundation for a technical specification currently in development, ISO/IEC TS 22440, which will provide more detailed guidance and requirements.\nISO/IEC TR 5469 was developed by the IEC and ISO joint committee for AI, SC 42, in a joint working group that combines their AI expertise with that of IEC TC 65/SC 65A, the committee behind the IEC 61508 functional safety series.\nProject editor Riccardo Mariani said the report will help to ensure functional safety of AI technologies, thus engendering trust.\n“This report will help developers to understand the challenges and the existing solutions to create AI applications that are safe, including a strong focus on continuous verification and improvement.”, noted Mariani.\nChair of the SC 42, Wael William Diab added: “Looking at how AI systems can be deployed in functional safety environments helps to ensure responsible adoption across a broader number of application domains, further unlocking the benefits of AI.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem.

        "content": "Global annual renewable capacity additions increased by almost 50% to nearly 510 gigawatts (GW) in 2023, the fastest growth rate in the past two decades, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile increases happened all over the world, China’s growth was the by far the most important. The IEA emphasized that “In 2023, China commissioned as much solar photovoltaic (PV) energy as the entire world did in 2022, while its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Globally, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide.”\nWhile encouraging, the growth is still not enough to meet the COP 28 climate targets. According to the IEA, under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7 300 GW by 2028. This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2,5 times its current level by 2030, falling short of the tripling goal.\nThe good news is that the target is achievable if all governments around the world play their part, including emerging countries which are not in the G20 group of nations.\nThe IEA  executive report also notes that in 2023, an estimated 96% of newly installed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind capacity had lower generation costs than new coal and natural gas plants. In addition, three-quarters of new wind and solar PV plants offered cheaper power than existing fossil fuel facilities. \nStandards and Conformity Assessment can help\nSeveral IEC Technical Committees develop international standards for renewable energy systems.

        "content": "The power of artificial intelligence, and computer modelling and simulation has greatly enhanced testing “what-if” scenarios within product development stages in different fields. Key to this is Digital Human Modelling (DHM), which offers computerized design and virtual simulations of humans with their physical properties and varying characteristics.\nDigital human models can enhance research and design in several areas such as automotive, space, fashion and medicine.\nWhile the technology has been around for several decades, its applications continue to evolve. See the full e-tech article which takes a deeper look into various other aspects of the technology.\nWhy is DHM so exciting?\n“Essentially, DHM uses computational tools to model and simulate the human body from inside out,” says Professor Sofia Scataglini, a biomedical engineer and renowned expert in human digital modelling and simulation.\nThese models can be integrated with other computerized systems, to design or study designs, workplaces or products in their relationship with humans, explains Scataglini.\nThe potential for digital human models is vast. “We’re looking at using them in health science and in medicine. We use a 4D scanning device, which allows us to scan the body shape but also the dynamics of the full body and study its variation over time (4D anthropometry). This enables us to measure a motor task such as a person’s gait or dynamic posture in a non-invasive way.”\n“It can be used in virtual scenarios for inclusive and personalized gamification. Or additionally, we use them for modelling musculoskeletal characteristics for digital simulations used in research. Along with this, artificial intelligence (AI) integration could also help with predictive modelling, which in turn can support applications like clinical decision making.\"\nThere are several other applications spanning use in chatbots, medical devices and more.\nImportance of human-centred design\nDigital human models can have several applications in gaming or healthcare, which means they will be used in products or services that would in some way be consumed or operated by humans.\nIn such applications, human-centred design goes almost hand-in-hand with DHM. Accurate modelling serves to provide better insights on the challenges faced by a person in using a product, by simulating the relevant body morphologies and traits.\nThat is why many experts, including Scataglini draw focus on human-centred design – where the focus is on people or the intended user. It is what allows for really taking into consideration the needs, requirements and accessibility of different users.\nFor instance, elderly users may struggle to understand or interact with technologies, and using DHM may provide better insights to developing solutions catering to their specific needs. It also opens up other possibilities – for instance, interfaces that use a digital human model as an assistant, could be synchronized with a friendly voice, perhaps a digital replica of a relative or a doctor, which could help elderly users feel less alone and more comfortable interacting with technologies at home.\nWhy is standardization needed?\nAs scientists explore the possibilities with human-centred design and DHM, standardization is crucial to facilitate the seamless integration of the technologies into different fields such as healthcare and more.\nThe IEC can play a pivotal role in paving the way for standardization in the area. The joint IEC and ISO technical committee on IoT, SC 41, sets standards for the Internet of Things, ensuring safety, reliability and compatibility across various applications.\nScataglini herself is heavily involved in standardization efforts through her work at national (NBN), European (CENELEC) and international levels (ISO and IEC).. In an attempt to promote awareness and foster scientific collaboration, she organizes an annual International Congress on Digital Human Modeling and has authored several seminal publications on the topic, including her latest book on human centred design towards enhanced healthcare.\nHer significant contributions and enthusiastic efforts in the field recently earned her an award for excellence in scientific and technological research."

        "content": "This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Le Maistre, a British engineer who played a pioneering role in international standardization. The Jersey-born Le Maistre was instrumental in setting up both the IEC and ISO and for this reason is often referred to as \"the father of international standardization.\"\nCharles Delacour Le Maistre was born in 1874, the seventh child of a humble country parson on the picturesque island of Jersey, in the English Channel. He studied electrical engineering at the Central Technical College in South Kensington and worked for a shipbuilding company.\nIn 1901, he joined the world’s first national standardization organization, the Engineering Standards Committee, which later became the British Standards Institution (BSI). In 1906, Le Maistre became the first General Secretary of the IEC, a position he held for nearly 50 years until 1953.\nLe Maistre spent much of his time travelling the world to proselytize for international standardization. In 1926, he initiated a series of meetings that led to the founding of the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations, a precursor to ISO, founded in 1946.\nLe Maistre’s work unfolded in an era marked by scientific progress. He understood the importance of the Giorgi system and worked to reconcile the disparities between international electrical and mechanical units.  \nOne of Le Maistre's most important achievements was the adoption of the Giorgi system by the IEC in 1935. The Giorgi system was the precursor of the International System of Units (SI).  \nLe Maistre greatest achievement was arguably the creation of a multi-stakeholder approach to standardization. Under his leadership, the IEC engaged top experts from manufacturers, retailers, academia and government bodies to work together in a consensus-based standardization process. \nHe called this approach \"the community of interest of producer and consumer\". He believed that the collaborative development of mutually agreed-upon technical solutions would ensure that standards were not only technically robust but also socially acceptable.\nLe Maistre’s legacy extends beyond the technical realm. According to his biographers, he was driven by the idea that bringing together engineers from around the globe to work together could make a significant contribution to world peace.\n\"Standardization, after all, is no more and no less than proper coordination\", he wrote. \"To effect it may necessitate the sinking of much personal opinion, but if its goal, through wideness of outlook and unity of thought and action, is the benefit of the community as a whole, standardization as a coordinated endeavour is bound increasingly to benefit humanity at large\".\nHis commitment to equal representation and democratic consensus in standardization processes remains a cornerstone of the institutional framework of the IEC to this day. \nLe Maistre died in Surrey, in 1953, shortly after receiving news that France had awarded him the country’s highest honour, the Legion of Honour. He already held the titles of Commander of the British Empire (CBE) and Knight Commander of the Order of Vasa.\n \nRead more\nCharles Le Maistre\nEngineering rules: global standard setting since 1880"

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have many processes that are specific to them, which is why a new international standard has just been published.\nAI systems such as machine learning, natural language processing, speech recognition and information retrieval use a combination of traditional software elements such as code and databases as well as those specific to AI. In machine learning, for example, part of the system is defined by training it on data as opposed to directly inputting code. The data also changes over time so retraining of the system may be needed.\nInternational standards for these processes can provide a strong platform on which developers and users can communicate, thus improving understanding and performance and reducing costs.\nISO/IEC 5338 is an internationally agreed way of describing an AI system life cycle that takes specific AI characteristics into account. It will help to improve understanding of the functions and performance of AI systems during development and promote mutual understanding between developers and users of AI systems.\nThe standard defines a set of processes and associated terminology for describing the life cycle of AI systems. ISO/IEC 5388 covers everything from key concepts to risk management, stakeholder needs, verification, maintenance and disposal.\nIt includes observations of processes based on use cases found in ISO/IEC TR 24030 to help identify AI-specific aspects.\nYuchang Cheng, project editor of ISO/IEC 5338 said: “The standard expands on current established and widely used life cycle processes for traditional software so that AI systems can benefit too. It enables developers to continually improve, resulting in more effective and efficient AI products and instill greater trust in users.”\nWael William Diab, Chair of the joint ISO and IEC committee for AI that developed the standard, SC 42, said: “This standard establishes AI system lifecycle processes. Having a common language and framework is key to ensuring responsible design, development and adoption of AI.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI, taking a holistic approach to consider the entire AI ecosystem. It looks at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight."

        "content": "Carbon footprint claims are perhaps one of the most common indicators that companies use to reflect their efforts towards more environmentally friendly practices. Advertising such sustainable approaches helps the company build trust and stand out favourably to their customers. But, in many cases, there is a need to check the claims of “green practices”. The methodologies used by different organizations to arrive at the claims might differ and therefore the outcomes may not be comparable. \nIn order to avoid misrepresentations, a verification of environmental claims is essential.\nIn such scenarios, tools that can analyze the veracity of these claims are needed to help establish trust and ensure that the companies advertising their products as eco-friendly meet the proper international standards. Read the full e-tech article here.\nBenefits of verifying carbon footprint claims\nA carbon footprint is a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, organization, event or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent. Measuring and reducing their carbon footprint is one method organizations adopt to act on climate change.\nIndependent verification can benefit an organization in increasing credibility and transparency, by proving its claims to regulators, public interest groups and organizational peers,\nIt can help enhance their reputation as responsible environmental stewards, while providing assurance that the carbon footprint calculation and reduction efforts are accurate, reliable, trustworthy and in keeping with international standards.\nIn many cases, it can also lead to improved efficiency and cost savings by identifying areas for improvement in a company’s carbon management.\nIt further ensures accountability of the companies to live up to their environmental promises.\nHow does IECQ’s carbon footprint claim verification service help?\nTo counter the problem of misrepresentation, the IEC through its IECQ system provides services that allows companies and manufacturers to verify that their carbon footprint claims are calculated using the correct process, methodology, and registers in accordance with the international standard ISO 14067.\nThis helps companies build confidence in the claims made by organizations regarding their environmental performance.\nThe standard ISO 14067, Greenhouse gases – Carbon footprint of products – Requirements and guidelines for quantification factors in the calculation of the carbon footprint of a product or service at various stages of the product’s life cycle, categorized mainly into three stages:\n\n\nDirect emissions from the manufacturing process.\n\n\nIndirect emissions from the energy used during the product's use, such as electricity consumption during operation.\n\n\nEmissions associated with the end-of-life stage, including transportation, disposal and recycling.\n\n\nIECQ’s service allows verification by seeing if the calculation of the carbon footprint is in compliance with the methodologies outlined in this international standard. IECQ also offers a suite of other certification and verification services which support circular approaches, promote implementation of environmentally conscious design and help manage and reduce the use of hazardous substances. These services contribute to responsible consumption and production of electronics, ensuring better energy access while helping to reduce the amounts of waste generated.\nRead more\nVerifying \"green\" claims\nReseources\nIECQ website"

        "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) evolves in leaps and bounds, governments and organizations are looking at ways to ensure it is developed in a trustworthy way. A new international standard for AI that organizations can certify to has just been published, increasing confidence in AI systems.\nA key driver of innovation in many areas such as healthcare, agriculture and travel, AI is increasingly prevalent and tipped to dramatically boost the global economy. Its market size market size was valued at USD136, 55 billion in 2022 and is expected to contribute USD15, 7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\nAs with most new technologies, there are hopes and fears with AI, and there are also risks if it is not used or developed wisely. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), left unguided, AI “has the capability to accelerate the environment’s degradation”. Ethical aspects, bias, transparency, privacy and misinformation are just some of the concerns around AI that need to be addressed in order for it to deliver its benefits in a safe and responsible way.\nGovernments around the world are racing to do that through the development of policies and regulations to govern AI, such as the EU AI Act and Canada’s AI and Data Act (AIDA).\nInternational standards can provide a strong foundation on which any technology or industry can be responsibly built. Combined with conformity assessment such as certification and testing, they are valuable tools for both complying with regulations and ensuring that global best practices are employed.\nJust published, ISO/IEC 42001 is intended to help an organization develop, provide or use AI systems responsibly through providing guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system. Being a management system standard, it can be certified to, thus providing reassurance to governments and stakeholders that the requirements have been implemented correctly.\nThe new standard is one of a portfolio of standards developed by SC 42 to enable certification and thus quality control in AI.\nChair of the joint IEC and ISO committee that developed the standard, SC 42, Wael William Diab said ISO/IEC 42001 provides a valuable opportunity to enable the benefits of AI to be truly felt.\n“By placing societal needs such as sustainability, transparency, trustworthiness and ethical considerations at the heart of our international standards development, our portfolio of standards can help unlock AI's full potential by ensuring responsible adoption. ISO/IEC 42001 is a first of its kind standard that is an essential part of an organization's toolset to support that.”\nOthers in the portfolio will include ISO/IEC 42005 that will provide guidance on performing AI system impact assessments and ISO/IEC 42006 which will provide requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of AI management systems.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business, regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight.\nThe fourth bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop was held in December 2023 and featured experts in the fields of AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.\nHear more about ISO/IEC 42001 from the experts who developed it:"

        "content": "Standards are key to meeting the requirements of the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, and the work of the joint ISO and IEC committee for AI, SC 42, is highly valued, said the European Commission’s Dr Tatjana Evas.\nDr Evas was speaking recently at the fourth ISO/IEC AI workshop held in December 2023.\n“We very much value SC 42 standardization activities. AI technologies are global, and international standards enable global interoperability and help reduce costs for companies.”\nHer comments came on the eve of the provisional agreement by the European Council and Parliament on the proposal of harmonized rules on AI known as the EU AI Act. It is the world’s first horizontal and legally binding AI product safety legislation and aims to ensure that AI systems in the EU market are safe and respect fundamental rights and values. The Act also aims to create a single market for trustworthy AI in the EU. It follows a risk-based approach, meaning the higher the risk, the stricter the rules.\nDr Evas has been involved in the discussions and negotiations around the Act and is responsible for all the ongoing work on the development of AI standards and conformity assessment, market surveillance, cyber security and liability as well as relationship of the AI Act proposal with the sectoral legislation.\nDuring her presentation at the event she said the Act details a number of requirements that AI systems need to fulfil to be used in the EU market, including a risk management system, governance and quality of datasets, transparency and information to AI users, human oversight and cyber security of AI systems and conformity assessment. The Commission has entrusted the European Committee for Standardization CEN/CENELAC to develop standards to support the requirements, she said, but international standards also play a significant role because international companies operating in the European market will need to comply.\n“If a standard is recognized as harmonized and published in the EU official journal, companies can rely on it for presumption of conformity, and this presumption of conformity is very important. Which is why the European Commission is increasingly engaged in SC 42 work because the closer international standards are to the requirements, the more beneficial it is for companies.”\nSC 42 has recently published an international management system standard, ISO/IEC 42001, that is expected to help organizations comply with the EU AI Act and any future national, regional or international legislation related to responsible and trustworthy AI.\nISO/IEC 42001 helps organizations to develop, provide or use AI systems responsibly by providing guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system. Being a management system standard, it can be certified to, thus providing reassurance to governments and stakeholders that the requirements have been implemented correctly.\nChair of SC 42, Wael William Diab said that the international standards being developed by SC 42 are a kay part of the solution to enable broad responsible adoption of AI systems.\n“Through its workshops, member participation and liaison partners, SC 42 has been fortunate to have a diverse set of stakeholders that include regulatory experts from across the world helping ensure that the international standards developed meet emerging global requirements,” he said.\n“Our ever-growing portfolio of standards will help to ensure we can reap the benefits of AI while simultaneously addressing ethical and trustworthiness issues.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence.

        "abstract": "The commented versions of around ten household appliance standards will be published by the end of 2023.",
        "content": "IEC Technical Committee 61, which prepares standards for the safety of household appliances, has always been at the forefront when it comes to publishing commented versions (CMVs) of standards. Commented versions clearly identify the differences between the previous version of the standard and the new version and also provide comments on each of the main technical changes. \nThe committee is currently publishing a huge raft of CMV standards. These include the ninth edition of IEC 60335-2-11, which specifies the safety requirements for tumble dryers, and stretch to the fourth edition of IEC 60335-2-97, which specifies the safety requirements for drives for shutters, awnings, blinds and similar equipment. \nAs the number of household appliances multiplies and their complexity increases, the IEC has regularly updated the general safety requirements for these appliances, which can be found in IEC 60335-1. A sixth edition of the standard was published in 2020 as a CMV and was the first TC 61 Standard to experiment with the new publication format.\nIEC 60335-1 protects against many types of hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation when appliances are used under normal and expected abnormal conditions. It also considers how electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances. \n“We are currently updating all of our IEC 60335-2 Standards to the 2020 edition of the IEC 60335-1 Standard, which was our first CMV. This alignment work started in 2021 and we hope to complete it next year. This means we publish on average 20+ new editions each year,” says TC 61 expert Michelle Andersen.\nTo be able to publish such a large number of CMVs, steps were taken to streamline the work required. “Many of the changes are common with the updates to IEC 60335-1. Some additional changes are being made across all Part 2 Standards, such as updating the use of the child test probes for accessibility, adding surface temperature limits based on IEC Guide 117 and clarifying remote operation requirements. This allows us to utilize common comments for many of the changes being made in the new editions and has drastically improved our efficiency in completing the CMV drafts,” Michelle Andersen explains.\nTo find out more about the full list of these standards, contact Angela Colonna, Product Marketing Specialist at the IEC at: aco@iec.ch"

        "abstract": "We need a standardized and unified approach to understanding and discussing the concepts of AI to deal with the many ethical and technical challenges while harnessing the benefits of AI.",
        "content": "As the technologies of artificial intelligence continue to permeate our daily lives, the need for a standardized and unified approach to understanding and discussing AI concepts becomes increasingly crucial. This is where ISO/IEC 22989, the IEC and ISO standard on AI terminology, can play a fundamental role.\nISO/IEC 22989 underlines the critical importance of using the same technical terms to achieve clarity, consistency and accuracy in communication. Using the same technical terms can also facilitate effective regulation, international research and trade, as well as reducing costs and increasing the confidence of citizens in products and services.\nThe AI landscape has been characterized by a diverse and often inconsistent use of terminology. This has hindered effective communication and collaboration among various stakeholders. \nISO/IEC 22989 addresses this challenge by establishing a comprehensive and standardized vocabulary for AI concepts and descriptions. This standardized framework serves as a common language, enabling clear and unambiguous discussions about AI systems, their applications and the ethical considerations surrounding their development and deployment.\nThe international standard, which is available for free, can therefore play a crucial role in developing regulations and governance frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical development and deployment of beneficial AI. It does this by providing a common understanding and vocabulary for discussing AI concepts.\nFostering informed policymaking\nIn other words, ISO/IEC 22989 enables policymakers to have clear and consistent discussions about AI issues by establishing a standardized terminology. This shared understanding is crucial for developing informed and well-considered regulations that address the potential challenges and opportunities presented by AI. \nWithout a common language, policymakers will face difficulties in understanding the complexities of AI and formulating regulations that effectively address these challenges.\nPromoting transparency and explainability\nFor example, transparency and explainability (explicability) are essential aspects of responsible AI development and deployment. ISO/IEC 22989 promotes these principles by defining these and other related terms.\nThis can help policymakers to establish clear requirements for AI systems to be transparent and explainable, ensuring that AI decisions can be understood and justified.\nAs AI regulations evolve across different jurisdictions, it becomes increasingly important to ensure consistency and harmonization. ISO/IEC 22989 serves as a valuable tool for developing consistent and harmonized AI regulations. \nHaving a standardized framework for terminology also facilitates the development of regulations that are aligned across different regions and industries.\n\"There is global concern about the need for a governance framework to ensure the safe and responsible development of beneficial AI systems. It will be impossible to develop without standardized terminology based on the consensus of a broad range of stakeholders,\" said Wael William Diab, who chairs the IEC and ISO joint technical committee that develops standards for AI.\nGuiding ethical discourse\nOf course, the far-reaching implications of AI extend beyond advancements in technology. AI raises concerns about potential biases, fairness and societal impact. \nISO/IEC 22989 provides a common framework for discussing and assessing ethical issues in AI development by defining relevant terms such as \"bias\", \"fairness\" and \"social impact\". This can help policymakers to establish clear ethical principles and guidelines for AI systems.\nAgain, the international standard encourages ethical discussions that are grounded in shared understanding by establishing common terminology agreed through a global, consensus-driven process.\nEnhancing clarity and reliability\nFurthermore, the consistent use of AI terminology promotes interoperability between different AI systems and applications. This is particularly critical in the context of integrating AI-powered components into broader systems or platforms. \nInteroperability facilitates seamless integration and the creation of more robust and adaptable solutions by ensuring that AI systems speak the same language.\nISO/IEC 22989 also contributes to the development of reliable and responsible AI systems by promoting transparency in AI development and decision-making processes. The standard emphasizes the importance of explainability, ensuring that AI systems can provide clear justifications for their actions, as well as fostering trust and accountability.\nSC 42 considers the entire AI ecosystem by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, as well as ethical and societal concerns."

His address highlighted the pivotal role of international standards and conformity assessment in addressing climate challenges and fostering sustainable innovation.\nGreen Digital Action is a partnership of governments, businesses, civil society and UN agencies, spearheaded by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). While Information and communication technologies (ICTs) and AI offer promising approaches to tackling the climate crisis, the increasing amount and processing of data and devices means the sector’s own energy consumption, emissions, material use and e-waste is soaring. Green Digital Action aims to “put digital solutions at the forefront of climate action”.\nJoining ISO’s Sergio Mujica and ITU’s Seizo Onoe on stage, Mr Metzger emphasized the collaborative effort of the World Standards Cooperation and underscored the critical role of standards in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in areas such as clean energy access, industry innovation, and infrastructure development. He noted that the World Bank, in its tenders, leverages international standards, a further demonstration of the essential role they play in infrastructure.\nThe Secretary-General highlighted two fundamental pillars of standards' contributions: leveraging and enabling new low-carbon technologies and managing environmental challenges. He emphasized the importance of standards in the development and roll out of new technologies, including smart grids, renewable energy sources, and low-voltage direct current. Meanwhile, management standards published by the three organizations, offer solutions to escalating environmental challenges.\nMr Metzger drew attention to the significance and necessity of conformity assessment in providing a benchmark for standards, citing examples from IECEx for the safety of hydrogen.\nHe stressed how international standards can harmonize environmental requirements and performance indicators, providing a collaborative platform for diverse stakeholders. He concluded by asserting that standards foster competition, driving innovation and offering a vital solution to combat climate change."

What’s more, sunshine is a clean and renewable energy source, thus has the potential to reduce carbon emissions and solve climate change issues.\nSolar photovoltaics (PV) are the solution to capturing the sun’s energy and are one of the cheapest ways of producing new electricity in most countries. In 2022 solar PV generation showed an annual increase of 26%, the largest growth of all renewable energies, and it is expected to grow further to exceed that of coal by 2027.\nSolar PV therefore offers the potential to help countries meet climate targets, reduce carbon emissions and achieve electricity access for all.\nBut PV solar power plants are highly complex systems, made up of thousands of components combined and connected in various ways. They are also often viewed as costly, despite the fact that the return on investment over the long term can be significant.\nRoger Taylor is an expert in the PV industry and a convenor to taskforces as well as lead assessor for IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications. The big plus of a PV plant, he pointed out, is its low operating costs.\n“Sunlight is free,” he said, “so once it is set up it costs little to run. In fact, around 80% of total lifetime costs of a plant are in the year of build. Yet a well-built plant produces electricity for 30 or 40 years. Which is why it’s important to invest wisely in quality products and design and construction processes from the start.”\nIECEE, the IEC Conformity Assessment System for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components runs a programme which offers access to qualified testing laboratories for the certification of PV components and modules in accordance with the relevant IEC Standards.\nIECEE PV certificates demonstrate that all the elements and components are designed, manufactured and tested according to IEC International Standards, which means they will comply with quality and safety requirements worldwide. They provide manufacturers of PV installations with a simple and reliable way of identifying the components that will allow them to build high quality PV products and systems.\nThey also offer clear benefits to industry and end users, but also to governments, supporting policy initiatives and incentives, which are crucial to meeting climate targets.\nRead the full story in the latest issue of e-tech."

        "content": "Lithium-ion batteries are one of the favoured options for renewable energy storage. They are widely seen as one of the main solutions to compensate for the intermittency of wind and sun energy. \nUtilities around the world have ramped up their storage capabilities using li-ion supersized batteries, huge packs which can store anywhere between 100 to 800 megawatts (MW) of energy. California based Moss Landing's energy storage facility is reportedly the world’s largest, with a total capacity of 750 MW/3 000 MWh.\nThe price of li-ion batteries has tremendously fallen over the last few years and they have been able to store ever-larger amounts of energy. However, the disadvantages of using li-ion batteries for energy storage are multiple and quite well documented. The performance of li-ion cells degrades over time, limiting their storage capability. Issues and concerns have also been raised over the recycling of the batteries, once they no longer can fulfil their storage capability, as well as over the sourcing of lithium and cobalt required. Cobalt, especially, is often mined informally, including by children. One of the most important producers of cobalt is the Democratic Republic of Congo. The challenge of energy storage is also taken up through projects in the IEC Global Impact Fund. Recycling li‑ion is one of the aspects that is being considered.\nLastly, li-ion is flammable and a sizeable number of plants storing energy with li‑ion batteries in South Korea went up in flames from 2017 to 2019. While causes have been identified, notably poor installation practices, there was a lack of awareness of the risks associated with li-ion, including thermal runaway.\nIEC Standards and Conformity Assessment \nLi-ion cells are standardized by IEC TC 21, which publishes the IEC 62660 series on secondary li-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs. TC 21 also publishes standards for renewable energy storage systems. The first one, IEC 61427‑1, specifies general requirements and methods of test for off-grid applications and electricity generated by PV modules. The second, IEC 61427-2, does the same but for on-grid applications, with energy input from large wind and solar energy parks. “The standards focus on the proper characterization of the battery performance, whether it is used to power a vaccine storage fridge in the tropics or prevent blackouts in power grids nationwide. These standards are largely chemistry agnostic. They enable utility planners or end-customers to compare apples with apples, even when different battery chemistries are involved,” TC 21 expert Herbert Giess describes.\nIEC TC 120 was set up specifically to publish standards in the field of grid integrated electrical energy storage (EES) systems in order to support grid requirements. An EES system is an integrated system with components, which can be batteries that are already standardized. The TC is working on a new standard, IEC 62933‑5‑4, which will specify safety test methods and procedures for li-ion battery-based systems for energy storage.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four conformity assessment systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and hazardous substance of batteries.\n\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "AI has the potential to help reduce carbon emissions and contribute to climate goals, but it can also consumer a lot of energy . A new standard for sustainable AI is in development.",
        "content": "Knowledge is power, so the old adage goes, and greater knowledge is at the heart of AI’s potential to combat climate change. Because the capacity for AI to analyse highly complex and multi-faceted databases is giving us a better understanding of our impact on the environment, thus allowing us to make more informed decisions.\nMonitoring and analysis using AI systems can help organizations optimize their use of resources such as energy, water and materials to avoid waste and identify which products and services are the most carbon emitting. AI technologies can help with sustainable building design, precision agriculture, air pollution and even in reducing climate warming vapour trails.\nYet AI systems have the tendency to consume a lot of energy themselves. Some reports say global emissions from cloud computing emit more carbon than commercial airlines and a recent study showed that, by 2027, the AI industry could be using as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands.\nWhile many efforts are underway to reduce these emissions, such as more efficient systems and the use of renewable sources of energy, more can be done.\nThe IEC and ISO joint committee for AI, SC 42, is working on the world’s first international standard for sustainability in AI.\nThe technical report ISO/IEC TR 20226, when published next year, will cover all the aspects where AI and environmental sustainability coincide. This includes everything from energy and water consumption, waste, carbon footprint, the AI system life cycle and supply chains. It will also include ways to measure the environmental sustainability aspects of AI systems, such as energy efficiency, raw materials, transport and water, as well as approaches to reducing AI systems’ environmental sustainability impacts.\nProject editor Harm Ellens said the primary objective of the report is to make these aspects visible to end users in order to enable them to make informed choices.\n“It includes practices from around the world that help organizations actively reduce their impact on the environment.”\nRead more in e-tech.\nLearn about the upcoming technical report on sustainability in AI from project editor Harm Ellens."

        "abstract": "A new international standard, ISO/IEC 27402, sets baseline requirements for IoT security and privacy.",
        "content": "According to estimates, there are around 15 billion connected IoT devices in the world, a number which is expected to almost double by 2030. The need for robust security and privacy controls has never been more critical. \nAs these interconnected devices continue to permeate our daily lives, their susceptibility to cyber threats grows exponentially. Recognizing this imperative, a groundbreaking international standard, ISO/IEC 27402 recommends a baseline set of requirements specifically tailored to enhance the security and privacy of IoT devices.\nCyber-attacks\nSeveral kinds of cyber-attacks target IoT devices, depending on the motives and resources of the attackers. Some of the most common types of cyber-attacks on IoT devices include:\n\n\nDDoS attacks: Distributed denial of service attacks aim to overwhelm the network or server with a large amount of traffic from compromised IoT devices. This can cause the network or server to slow down or crash, affecting the availability and performance of the services or applications that rely on them. In 2016, the Mirai malware infected millions of IoT devices, turning them into bots and using them to launch massive DDoS attacks on several websites.\n\t \n\n\nMITM attacks: Man-in-the-middle attacks involve intercepting or altering the communication between IoT devices and their servers or controllers, such as mobile apps or cloud platforms. This can allow the attackers to steal sensitive data, manipulate the device's behaviour, or inject malicious commands. An example of a MITM attack on IoT devices is the 2017 KRACK attack, which exploited a vulnerability in the Wi-Fi protocol to break the encryption and hijack the traffic between IoT devices and wireless access points.\n\t \n\n\nBrute-force attacks: These attacks involve trying different combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to IoT devices or accounts. This can allow hackers to take control of the devices, change their settings, or install malware. An example of a brute-force attack on IoT devices is the Silex malware, which targeted IoT devices in 2019 with default or weak credentials and wiped their firmware, rendering them unusable.\n\t \n\n\nEavesdropping attacks: These attacks involve listening to the data transmitted by IoT devices, such as audio, video, or sensor readings. This can allow the attackers to spy on the users, collect personal or confidential information, or identify vulnerabilities. An example of an eavesdropping attack on IoT devices is the Verkada hack, which exposed the live feeds of over 150,000 security cameras in various organizations, including hospitals, schools, and prisons, in 2021.\n\n\nUnderstanding the landscape\nThe sheer prevalence of IoT devices across networks and systems makes them attractive targets for cyber-attacks. The interconnected nature of these devices introduces vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could have far-reaching consequences. \nAcknowledging the urgency of addressing these risks, ISO/IEC 27402 offers essential guidance on the essential features and countermeasures necessary for bolstering the security and privacy of IoT devices.\nA holistic approach: risk assessment and treatment\nAt the heart of this new international standard lies a comprehensive risk assessment framework. Understanding the risks associated with IoT devices is paramount to developing an effective risk treatment plan. \nThe idea is that by identifying the required features and countermeasures, users can actively mitigate potential threats, ensuring that IoT devices meet the highest standards of security and privacy.\nThe scope of the standard\nISO/IEC 27402 broadly outlines requirements applicable to IoT devices entering the market. These requirements serve as a baseline on which various vertical markets can build additional specifications tailored to their unique applications and associated risks. \nSectors such as health, financial services, industrial, consumer electronics and transport can leverage this standard as a foundation for developing sector-specific requirements.\nA scalable global approach\nISO/IEC 27402 not only provides a scalable approach to addressing the dynamic nature of IoT devices but also fosters a globally harmonized perspective. It serves as a valuable tool for informing technical policies and regulatory initiatives on a global scale by offering a common baseline for security and privacy requirements.\nISO/IEC 27402 is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, which offers guidance on initiating, implementing, maintaining and improving information security management within an organization. The 27000 family of standards includes ISO/IEC 27001, which provides detailed advice on implementing an information security management system (ISMS).\nISO/IEC 27402 is the work of the joint IEC and ISO technical committee SC 27. The subcommittee is responsible for developing international management and technical standards for information security and privacy protection and related topics. \nThe scope of SC 27 includes developing standards for the security and privacy protection of systems, information technologies, processes and services."

        "content": "What are the main challenges for the hydroelectric industry in the future? EDF expert and IEC TC 4 Chair Pierre Maruzewski shares his insights with us.\nHigher temperatures as a result of climate change have affected water distribution and availability. How is TC 4 addressing the issue?\nYes, water, or its lack of it, is becoming a fundamental issue. I work for EDF in France and the very long, hot and dry summer we endured had a major impact on the availability of water. Despite recent record rainfalls, we have not fully recovered our water capability. The market is adapting to the situation and manufacturers are proposing new types of turbines which work at lower power levels, or if you prefer lower water levels. But this means the machines are more likely to be subject to fatigue. We are about to publish a new standard dealing with the fatigue of turbines, quite an essential document. It will be released during the first quarter of next year and it is greatly awaited. IEC 63230 assembles all the information on different IEC and non-IEC Standards that exist on manufacturing and quality assurance.\nThere is a global effort to keep hydraulic installations running for as long as possible and rehabilitating them when necessary. As we all focus on the circular economy, what standards from TC 4 help with the rehabilitation of hydro power stations?\nWe are revising IEC 62256, which addresses turbine rehabilitation, life assessment and performance improvement. Some hydro installations have been around for more than 50 years, and their turbines need to be completely rehabilitated to continue operating. While it may seem costly, it is obviously less so than building a new installation from scratch.\nLooking ahead, what new technology is likely to have an impact on hydraulic energy?\nAdditive manufacturing and 3D printing. The productivity gains would be huge for the industry. You could reduce the time spent on producing a turbine by around 50%. \nI want to create a new working group on that topic. There is a need for a guide on which metals to use for the printing process, for instance.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "abstract": "A key new standard dealing with LEDs used for horticultural lighting has been published by the IEC.",
        "content": "The IEC has published a new standard which covers LEDs used for horticultural lighting.\nLight emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly used for horticultural lighting and are one of the features of vertical farming. LED lights emit significantly less heat than other forms of lighting, allowing them to be tightly packed in vertical installations without harming crops. Specific LED grow lights have been developed which can produce the exact spectrum of light required for photosynthesis to occur in optimal conditions. These lights can replicate and even improve on the properties of sunlight. LEDs can be finely tuned to match the different development stages of plants, from blooming to fruit development, improving their taste and their levels of vitamins and antioxidants.\nThe new standard, IEC 63403-2, is part of the IEC 63403 series, published under the general title Horticultural lighting– LED packages for horticultural lighting. It specifies the binning method for LED packages for horticultural lighting.\nAccording to the Global Lighting Forum, LED binning is a process of sorting LEDs according to specific criteria such as chromaticity, lumen output and sometimes forward voltage (amount of voltage it takes to turn on an LED). Variability in the manufacturing process from wafer production and crystal growth to component packaging will inevitably lead to slight differences in intensity and colour of LEDs even within a single production batch. Binning keeps variations of the performance characteristics of a particular group of LEDs within defined acceptance criteria. \nFor more information on the work of IEC Technical Committee 34, which publishes standards for lighting, read: Smart lighting."

Developed through international consensus, it helps to promote consistency and harmonization across the many architectures that already exist.\nNand Kishor Narang, vice chair of the SyC and project leader of IEC SRD 63188 said the guidance was developed in response to the lack of an agreed basis for efficient and effective cooperation between different smart cities programmes and projects.\n“What was needed was a common methodology to develop reference architectures of complex systems of systems including, but not limited to, smart cities. IEC SRD 63188 defines the methodology to do this to ensure it will be a firm foundation for a city to use. It explicitly links stakeholders’ needs with the principles of reference architecture to explain how future solutions can address their concerns.”\nThe SyC is also working on an internationally agreed SCRA that will bring methodological and practical guidance on how to achieve the essential characteristics of a smart city.\n“The SCRA we are developing will help facilitate cooperation and coordination amongst the various stakeholders, programmes and projects to develop potential solutions to these challenges and enable cities to thrive,” said Mr Narang.\n \nLearn more about SCRAs with N.

        "abstract": "IEC Vice President, Vimal Mahendru shares insights from the 2023 G20 Standards Dialogue and the path ahead for sustainability standards.",
        "content": "IEC Vice President, Vimal Mahendru spoke at the 2023 G20 Standards Dialogue, held in India over 2-3 November. The IEC participated in the Dialogue alongside the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), organized by the Bureau of Indian Standards.\nThe event focussed on inclusive standardization and good regulatory practices to achieve ‘Zero Defect and Zero Effect’ ensuring high-quality products with zero effect on the environment.\nMr. Mahendru moderated the session ‘Standards for Sustainability’, where he ignited conversations around the urgent need for sustainability and how the issue is perceived by global leaders around the world.\nSpeaking to the IEC Editorial Team, Mr. Mahendru shared insights on the path ahead for sustainability standards.\nWhat is the main challenge in developing global sustainability standards?\nAt IEC, the Standardization Management Board already emphasizes the need to analyze how our standards contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals; and one of the key strategic goals of the IEC is to foster a sustainable future. So, we have agreement on the severity of the issue. Now, the main challenge that we face is to empower technical committees which are usually focused on performance standards to also address sustainability issues. These experts have spent decades perfecting their jobs. However, they do not always have sustainability expertise. And therein lies the gap that we need to bridge.\n\nHow are the different stakeholders at IEC approaching this issue?\nWhen it comes to writing standards, it’s a bottom-up approach, effectively getting the best results from a range of experts in the field. It is consensus driven work by the National Committees (NC) and Technical Committees (TC). Governance on the other hand, is a top-down approach. It is therefore, important to remember that the directives set by an organization have to be accompanied by adequate capacity-building needed to implement the desired vision.\nThe good thing is that everyone across the system, right from TCs, and NCs, to all the governance boards, are aligned in recognizing sustainability as the biggest issue we need to tackle today.\nWhat are the next steps for IEC on the path towards sustainability standards?\nAcknowledging the urgency of the situation, IEC had formed a Sustainability Task Force, which I was previously chairing, to put together an action plan. Implementing the recommendations of the task force, IEC is looking forward to incorporating sustainability officers who would help carve out robust roadmaps to effectively foster standards for sustainability.\nHaving said that, IEC has several existing standards that enable material efficiency and support a circular economy. But we still have a long road ahead of us. In most cases, the electrotechnical industry does not have sustainability experts who can really address issues like circularity, or eco-design.  As a result, committees are now starting to recognize the importance of having people with core sustainability backgrounds.\nAdditionally, we have a lot of standards which have elements of sustainability intrinsically embedded into them. For instance, we have standards focussed on energy efficiency, which done well is perhaps one of the best ways of supporting sustainability.\nGoing forward Conformity Assessment (CA) systems are also looking to better address implementation and verification of sustainability aspects in standards. IECQ’s environment-focussed green services allow certification to eco-design considerations or verification of a product’s carbon footprint claims. IECEx has a vital role to play in ensuring safety in the shifting global focus on ‘green hydrogen’. IECRE continues to support the transition to renewable energy systems. And IECEE, in addressing many different product categories, also includes items like solar PV parts and modules, hence its relevance for an economy looking for renewable alternatives.\nWhat are some of the focus areas for the development of standards for sustainability?\nNaturally, standards that accelerate the transition to renewable energy alternatives and lead to a net-zero emissions world, are important. \nConsequently, we hope for a wider adoption of renewable energy standards, electric vehicle standards, and sustainability elements within existing performance standards for products.\nThe IEC is very cognizant of the emergence of green hydrogen as a frontrunner in the race to find feasible alternatives to conventional polluting fossil fuels. The IECEx, which has been ensuring safety around the flammable gas for a long time, will continue to play a vital role in the expanding green hydrogen economy.\nHow do you foresee collaboration with other standards bodies like ISO and ITU?\nOne thing is clear. All three are on the same page about being in this together. And so, we must look for solutions together. Everyone recognizes the unique value of each of the three entities. But coming together, we can deliver wholesome value to the consumers.\nThe environmental issues we face today, do not know any borders. Therefore, the world has to come together and look for that one solution. I firmly believe that having one set of sustainability standards for everyone, will allow for products to be sustainably developed and maintain interoperability for international trade. In this way, we ensure that the solutions we formulate, can benefit everyone across the globe."

        "content": "The Austrian Electrotechnical Association, OVE, is organizing the OVE Innovation Day 2023 on 16 November 2023, with the focus being on “Green Tech” and the role of standardization as a driver for innovation.\nBusiness representatives and industry insiders are coalescing to discuss innovative tech solutions that have established themselves on the market, new research in promising areas and the ways in which standardization can support the move to a more sustainable economy. \nThe IEC was represented at the event by Jo Cops, IEC President, Philippe Metzger, IEC Secretary-General and CEO and Vimal Mahendru, Chair of the Standardization Management Board (SMB).\nJo Cops opened the event alongside Peter Reichel, OVE Secretary-General. In his speech, the IEC President paid tribute to Christian Gabriel, previous head of standardization at OVE who passed away unexpectedly in August. On the theme of “Green Tech” he emphasized how “standards and conformity assessment systems are paving the way for sustainable technology and solutions”.\nBoth he and Vimal Mahendru, who gave a talk on “Green Tech and the strategic initiatives at the IEC”, underscored how the IEC’s strategic vision aligns with the pursuit of sustainable technology and solutions.\nThe three pillars of the IEC strategy were elucidated, each playing a crucial role in fostering innovation and addressing contemporary challenges.\nThe first strategic goal is about enabling a digital and all-electric society. In an age dominated by digitalization, the IEC stands as a global authority in setting standards and conformity assessment services for all electrical and electronic technologies. By establishing a foundation for a seamless digital and all-electric society, the IEC empowers innovators to concentrate on creating groundbreaking solutions that can redefine industries and improve lives.\nThe second strategic pillar focuses on fostering a sustainable world. As the world grapples with environmental challenges, including the pressing issue of climate change, IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment systems for green technologies and renewable energy sources assume unprecedented importance. They not only address environmental concerns but also act as catalysts for economic growth, encouraging the development of innovative technologies that can shape a more sustainable future.\nThe third strategic goal is to lead on trust, inclusion, and collaboration. The speakers underscored the IEC commitment to creating a global platform for collaboration that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By fostering a culture of trust and inclusion, the IEC ensures that innovators worldwide, irrespective of their background, can contribute to the organization's mission. This commitment to diversity of thought and expertise is integral to driving innovation and progress on a global scale.\nPhilippe Metzger then participated in a panel discussion on the role of standardization in the context of the system change towards a sustainable economy.\nThe event will conclude with the presentation of the OVE Innovation Award.\n\nVimal Mahendru, Chair of the IEC SMB gives a talk on “Green Tech and the strategic initiatives at the IEC”"

        "content": "Digital twins have come a long way since NASA first coined the concept in the 1960s following the explosion of Apollo 13 in space. By creating a living model of the spaceship and feeding it with data, it could test out simulations to ensure things would go smoother the next time around.\nNow with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) shaping our world, digital twins are being used in everything from smart manufacturing to agriculture, health care, smart cities, mining and more.\nDigital twins are used for the analysis, design and testing of designs of products, from sailing boats and buildings to airplanes and spaceships. For example, city planners can recreate their city and test different types of infrastructure or transportation, while surgeons can practice on digital twin patients before inserting the knife into a real person.\nThey are also used in an operational setting for, amongst other things, monitoring and preventive maintenance. What’s more, digital twins can be interconnected and federated to provide even deeper, more complex insights and model complex system-of-systems such as smart cities.\nThis is good news for industries wanting a reliable way of designing and testing things out before they go live. But as the use of digital twins has exploded across a wide range of domains, so too has the number of different definitions and terminologies, making interoperability and communication in the industry a little tricky. A new IEC International Standard has just been published to provide a generic set of terms and definitions that everyone can use.\nISO/IEC 30173 is the first international standard to provide a globally agreed set of sector neutral terms and definitions of digital twin, digital twin concepts, functional view of digital twin and digital twin stakeholders.\nIt provides a common basis for understanding digital twin and related concepts, as well as an overview of the life cycle of a digital twin in relation to the target entity it represents. It can be used as a foundation for developing other standards in the field of digital twin, and to support communications amongst diverse parties and stakeholders.\nIt defines digital twin as “the digital representation of a target entity with data connections that enable convergence between the physical and digital states at an appropriate rate of synchronization”.\nDeveloped by the joint IEC and ISO committee SC 41, the new standard also provides a solid foundation on which other international standards can be developed.\nChair of the committee Dr François Coallier said digital twin is a rapidly evolving technology that is already used in many sectors, so it is important that all stakeholders in the industry have a common reference for concepts and terminology.\n“Digital twins are becoming more and more sophisticated, with an increasing number of applications and uses. This standard will help different parties involved in digital twins to speak the same language, enabling greater interoperability between people and teams working on digital twin, therefore helping to facilitate international and cross-sectors activities in this area.”\nOther standards in development by the committee include one that will describe use cases in a wide variety of contexts, such as smart buildings and smart cities; a generic digital twin reference architecture (RA); and a digital twin maturity model."

        "content": "The IEA has urged countries to invest more into modernizing and upgrading the electricity grid. In what it claims is a first report of its kind, the agency finds that the world must add or replace 80 million km of grids by 2040, equal to all grids globally today, to meet national climate targets and support energy security.\nDemand for electricity is predicted to surge as many consumers switch to low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. Companies in heavily polluting industries, including steelmakers, are also looking to electrification to help them decarbonize.\nThe report identifies a large and growing queue of renewables projects waiting for the green light to be connected to the grid, pinpointing 1 500 gigawatts worth of these projects that are in advanced stages of development. This is five times the amount of solar PV and wind capacity that was added worldwide last year.\n“The recent clean energy progress we have seen in many countries is unprecedented and cause for optimism, but it could be put in jeopardy if governments and businesses do not come together to ensure the world’s electricity grids are ready for the new global energy economy that is rapidly emerging,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “This report shows what’s at stake and needs to be done. We must invest in grids today or face gridlock tomorrow.”\nHow the IEC can help\nThe IEC develops the IEC 61850 Standards which are widely identified as the core standards for the smart grid. They are a foundational series of publications which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They deal with issues such as the integration of renewable energies within the electrical network but also increased automatization and self-healing processes.\nThey are THE publications utilities employ when aiming to upgrade or modernize the electricity network.\nIEC has also set up a systems committee, SyC Smart Energy, to provide systems-level standardization for smart energy and smart grids. The SyC helps identify all  the relevant standards and coordinates the work of the many technical committees involved in smart energy standardization.\nThe IEC has equally published a smart grid standardization roadmap which provides guidelines to select the most appropriate set of standards and specifications."

        "abstract": "Scientists have found new hope for clean fuel in white and gold hydrogen. As research in the area grows, IECEx will have a pivotal role to play.",
        "content": "Up until a year ago, there wasn’t much enthusiasm for potential energy benefits from white and gold hydrogen. However, this could be changing. More and more researchers are seeing possible hope in white and gold hydrogen as feasible alternatives to conventional emission intensive fuels.\nIn a transition to hydrogen as an energy source at a bigger scale would call for expertise in handling the gas in new areas. IECEx, is expected to play an important role in continuing to ensure everyone’s safety in dealing with the flammable gas.\nRead the full story in the e-tech article.\nWhat is white or gold hydrogen?\nHydrogen itself is a flammable gas that scientists knew of as a distinct element as long back as in 1766.\nThe colour label assigned to it relates to how the hydrogen is sourced or created and if the production process itself results in lesser carbon emissions than conventional methods of generating the gas.\nHydrogen presents a promising solution as a fuel for the future. Many experts think it has the potential to be a game changer in achieving decarbonization goals, especially if it is labelled green or even white or gold.\nPotential clean fuels\nThe magic of getting to a clean fuel is in the process: green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis, where the electrical energy required is coming not from coal or fossil fuels but from a renewable energy source like the wind or the sun. By contrast white hydrogen refers to naturally occurring reserves of underground hydrogen. The term gold is given specifically to hydrogen produced by microbial activities in depleted oil wells. White and gold hydrogen could therefore be potentially cleaner than conventional ways of producing hydrogen.\nGreen, white or gold hydrogen could be used as an alternative fuel that can be used in versatile applications such as power generation, transportation, heating or other industrial processes. Since it can be stored, it is also a great option for off-grid power supply setups and enabling rural electrification.\nNew research in the area\nThere has been a recent spike in investments into research and exploration of its feasibility, which is proof of high hopes for the alternative fuel.\nOne of the biggest endorsements has come from the US Department of Energy (DOE) which announced up to $20 million to funding research around the potential of geologic hydrogen.\nThe Research and Development wing of the US DOE, ARPA-E, is optimistic about new methodologies and avenues that may accelerate our understanding of generating and extracting clean hydrogen. “When it comes to geologic hydrogen, we’re asking are there disruptive ways to access this hydrogen source and explore the potential?,\" says ARPA-E Director Evelyn N. Wang in a press release. She explains that there might be opportunities for accelerating the development of hydrogen production. Using stimulated mineralogical processes could yield larger quantities of subsurface hydrogen that could be a substantial source for clean energy.\nIt must be kept in mind, though, that there is a long way to go before understanding if white hydrogen really is a clean source of energy overall. More work needs to be done to evaluate the impact of extracting geologic hydrogen and estimate how energy intensive it is.\nEnsuring safety with IECEx\nIECEx, a conformity assessment system set up to deal with the testing and certification to IEC, ISO/IEC and ISO International Standards relating to equipment for use in explosive atmospheres, has always been relied upon by the hydrogen economy since its inception.\n“As a flammable substance, equipment, services and competence of persons in areas associated with hydrogen have been covered by IECEx certification since IECEx began issuing certificates in 2003 with more than 30 000 certificates issued to date,” says IECEx Executive Secretary, Chris Agius.\nIECEx helping bring emerging technologies to market\nThe increased focus on hydrogen as a future energy source has seen IECEx partnering with other international organizations including ISO, in particular ISO TC 197/SC1, with whom IECEx has established a formal partnership, as well as an on-going close collaboration with IRENA with current work focused on developing position papers which will be considered during the upcoming COP 28 in Dubai.\nIECEx oversees the compliance with international standards that address hydrogen safety, and its certification continues to be a valuable tool for facilitating trade at national levels and across international markets.\nWith expansion of hydrogen in the fuel market, IECEx certification allows manufacturers and consumers to gain confidence in international markets and helps accelerate the establishment of an energy infrastructure with more clean fuels.\nFor more information: www.iecex.com"

        "content": "The IEC international standards development workflow is nearing full functionality in the Online Standards Development (OSD) platform, with feedback from early adopters and national mirror committee members proving it to be a valuable tool for standards makers.\nThe OSD key functionalities for National Committees (NCs) were presented to more than 80 participants from IEC members at the Academy & Capacity Building workshop held virtually during the 87th IEC General Meeting. The tool can now be used for authoring, editing, commenting and voting on a standard in progress.\nThe OSD tool enables the full international standards development process in one online platform (XML). It is a harmonized solution for the IEC and ISO technical community to write, review and comment on technical documents.\nIt facilitates collaborative work in complete transparency, including commenting and comment resolution. It also provides a foundation to support Smart Standards and other digitalization initiatives.\nThe IEC TC 108 (safety of electronic equipment within the field of audio/video, information technology and communication technology) is one of a growing number of early adopters of the OSD platform. Valara M Davis, TC 108 Secretary, said using the platform made standards development much simpler.\n“Some of the things I found helpful is that all of the normative references and bibliography are automated, and there is a quality review option to address anything you may have missed,” she said.\n“Compared to using a word document, things like creating sections and clauses and linking terms and cross references is so much easier. What’s more, having everyone work from one single document is really beneficial.”\nAnother IEC committee that is piloting the OSD tool is TC 114 (marine energy). Administrator of the US Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of TC 114, Arielle Cardinal, agreed that allowing different experts to comment at the same time and discuss those comments was a huge benefit.\n“When we had heard about OSD, we immediately saw the value in it.  Throughout the whole process the IEC team was eager to hear from users and they took great care to understand the nuances of each NC so they could set up the tool to serve all NCs,” she said.\nThe IEC National Committee Secretary for South Africa, Johnson Marema, who is also piloting the tool, said he appreciated the reactivity of the IEC OSD team to address his suggestion regarding notifications for comments.\n“We had a recommendation for improvement which we sent to the IEC which was that whenever a comment was made in a document, I should get a notification,” he said.\n“But when the team reviewed it, they said I could get bombarded with notifications, so they introduced the pause commenting feature. I appreciate that they were very proactive. From the recommendation I made they actioned it with this new functionality.”\nThe OSD team is encouraging all TCs to sign up to be early adopters and experience the tool for themselves. They will soon be offering monthly webinars for those who are interested.\nIn addition, a monthly feedback session for users from the NCs will be organized by the OSD team to have a more dynamic exchange in respect of potential improvements and evolutions. Furthermore, IEC SMB  recently took the decision that all IEC technical committees and subcommittees must have at least one project in the OSD by the end of 2024.\nLearn more about OSD\nSign up for an upcoming information session on how to get started with OSD"

        "abstract": "IEC experts in Australia and the UK have given demonstrations of exciting new 5G and IoT applications and discussed the path ahead to 6G.",
        "content": "It has just been a few years since 5G, the fifth generation of wireless technology, broke ground into the market and is already revolutionizing industries and help overcome limiting factors of mobile capacity as many more devices are connected.\n5G doesn’t just offer increased speed, but also lower latency. A combination of both these factors translate to improved responsiveness and reliability.\nAt a recent webinar by IEC, experts from Telstra Labs and Vodafone gave live demonstrations illustrating the advantages of using 5G in various applications. They also shared what lies ahead for developing 5G and 6G technologies and encouraged young professionals in the field of standardization and conformity assessment to get involved.\n\nMike Wood and team joining live from Telstra Lab, Australia\nHow does it work?\nAs with previous generations, 5G networks are divided into geographic sub-areas called cells. Each cell has antennae that send out a mobile signal, through which devices in that region can connect to the network.\nTypically, with 4G, it sends out a signal in all directions whether there’s 1 or 10 or 100 users. With 5G there’s the possibility to send out smaller narrow beams of the signal to devices, which greatly improves efficiency and performance.\nRadio towers connect all of the users to a core data network that is made up of distributed servers including servers at the edge of the cell where users are located. Using distributed servers also improves efficiency and response times for applications meaning a better experience for customers.\nMike Wood, who chairs IEC Technical Committee 106, explained that the current 5G is actually working in conjunction with 4G, in what’s known as a non-standalone (NSA) network. But as we move forward in the evolution of the networks, 5G will become its own separate standalone (SA) network.\nWith the standalone network “we can actually slice part of the network and give those slices to dedicated services. A classic example of that is emergency and rescue services for police, fire and ambulance”, said Mr Wood.\nWhat applications does it have?\n5G has brought about enhanced mobile broadband, which means fast speeds. The greater capacity of 5G has enabled massive machine to machine communication catering for significantly more devises that smart homes and cities have.\nDemonstrating the speed and capacity of test systems, Mr Wood gave an example of how the capacity of the network was tested inadvertently during the pandemic: “Everyone went home to work. But because we'd launched 5G, the network picked up a lot of the traffic, and people didn't really notice the difference. But what they noticed is that the network still ran, which was fantastic. If we hadn’t deployed 5G, the existing networks would have been very congested.” \nFurthermore, low latency means better response time, which opens doors for enhanced IoT connectivity supporting services based on artificial intelligence and mobile edge computing.\nThe applications are limitless, ranging from smart transport networks and connected vehicles to augmented and virtual reality for mobile gaming.\nWith the capacity and responsiveness of 5G, search and rescue drones can fly higher and cover wider areas as the camera feed has a greater resolution and detection capability compared to 4G drones.\nMr Wood and his team in Australia presented a project that uses 5G to make cycling safer enabling cyclists “to see around corners”. Using the same principle as hooking up smart devices in a house on a connected network, the developers hope to bring this to the road with the 5G bike helmet.\n“With 5G networks, all the road users can be sharing the information in real time with each other. We'll be able to put that into the cloud, make intelligent decisions and then send down alerts as appropriate.”\n\nSami Gabriel, showing around the equipment at the Vodafone lab in UK\nPathway to 6G\n6G can advance the vision for smart and connected cities. It would enable the digital world meeting the physical world, something that is called, “cyber-physical continuum”. \nFor instance, current mapping apps can tell you where the traffic jams are and what the conditions are like, but they don’t feedback into the traffic systems.\nIn a truly connected city, cyber-physical continuum would mean that there is feedback into the physical world.  The apps could use technologies like AI to analyze and predict traffic flow and send feedback to the systems to optimize traffic flow and safety before an issue occurs.\nSami Gabriel, an IEC TC 106 expert joined from a Vodafone lab in the UK added, “The way that we will be looking at 6G is by focusing on the use cases that our current technologies can't quite deliver? Particularly where do we need that next evolution of the technology to deliver them.”\n\n6G would definitely increase speed. “Whatever you think, it will probably be faster,” said Mr Gabriel, adding that the real merit however is not just speed.\nHe said the larger capacity would make the difference. It can enable an even higher number of connected devices, but also enhance technologies like processing and data analysis.\nThere is still a long way ahead for 6G. The present priority is building capacity for realizing the potential of 5G networks.\nStandards will be essential\n“We cannot start rolling out technology without standards being in place”, said Mr Gabriel.\nMultiple areas beyond the essentials like communication protocols, will require standardization.\nIEC TC 106 develops international standards that describe methods and best practices for measuring and calculating the effects of electricity and magnetism on people. They help to make sure that people are safe and healthy when they use devices that have electricity and magnetism, such as phones, computers, radios and wireless chargers. They also help to make sure that these devices can work well with each other and not cause problems.\nMr Wood puts it more succinctly. “IEC TC 106, develops the testing standards for all mobile and wireless networks and devices that people have.  The tests ensure the networks and devices meet the stringent safety standards set by health agencies.\n“Standardization helps ensure safe levels of exposure of radiofrequencies to people, and the environment around us”.\nBoth Mr Wood and Mr Gabriel emphasized that as the technology evolves, so will their work in standardization and testing.\n“All the manufacturers planning to build 6G kits will have standards to guide them on how it needs to be tested, evaluated, and put out to the market. They figure these into their development plans. And we, as consumers, benefit from a wonderful new capability knowing that it will meet the safety standards”, said Mr Wood.\nThis ‘Live from the Lab’ webinar was part of the IEC Young Professionals workshop at the 2023 IEC General Meeting held between 19 October to 2 November. The Young Professionals Programme brings together and aims to inspire the future leaders of international standardization and conformity assessment.\n \n \nYou can follow the complete webinar on the IEC Academy page."

        "content": "The IEC has published a commented version of  IEC 60793-1-44, focusing on optical fibres measurement methods, as well as test procedures for cut-off wavelength. This commented version highlights all the differences between the new version (2023) and the old version (2011) of the standard.\nIEC 60793-1-44:2023 provides guidance on measuring the cut-off wavelength property of single-mode optical fibres. Standardizing this wavelength performance criteria for fibre types helps ensure the quality of single-mode fibre data transmission and the cables they are used in for commercial purposes. These methods work for different types of these fibres (called category B and C fibres). There are three ways to measure this property:\n\n\nMethod A measures the cut-off wavelength using a 22-metre-long piece of fibre that's not in a cable.\n\n\nMethod B does the same thing but with a 22-metre-long piece of fibre that's already in a cable.\n\n\nMethod C measures the cut-off wavelength using a shorter, two-metre-long piece of fibre that's not in a cable.\n\n\nNo matter which method is chosen, a reference measurement is needed to compare against. There are two techniques to do this reference measurement:\n\n\nbend-reference technique involves bending the fibre to measure its cut-off wavelength.\n\n\nmultimode-reference technique uses a specific type of multimode fibre called category A1 (OM1-OM5) to make the reference measurement.\n\n\nIt follows the publication of another fibre optic standard, IEC 60794-1-1:2023, also as a commented version. This standard applies to optical fibre cables for use with communication equipment and devices employing similar techniques and to cables having a combination of both optical fibres and electrical conductors. \nThe updated standard specifies electrical properties for optical ground wire (OPGW) and optical phase conductor (OPPC) cables. IEC 60794-1-1 establishes uniform generic requirements for the geometrical, transmission, material, mechanical, ageing (environmental exposure), climatic and electrical properties of optical fibre cables and cable elements, where appropriate.\nBoth the IEC 60793 and IEC 60794 series of standards are developed by IEC Technical Committee 86, which prepares standards for fibre optic systems, modules, devices, and components primarily intended for use with communications equipment. Commented versions (CMVs) are redline versions in which IEC experts have added significant and extensive comments explaining the changes to the publication.\nThe fibre optics market relies on IEC International Standards to ensure that its systems, devices, and components are compatible and operate safely within agreed-upon parameters."

The IEC can offer Africa a range of benefits including advancing Africa’s economic development and increasing electricity access.”\nEng. Abel Tella, Director General, Association of Power Utilities in Africa (APUA) highlighted there are many conflicting development challenges. For example, before solving the energy access problem, he said, African countries need to engage in the transition to renewable energies.\n“To reach our target of universal access to electricity by 2040, innovative financing, technology solutions and synergy between actors is needed, and urban, suburban, rural development needs to be coordinated.\nAt the same time, Africa’s participation in IEC work not only helps standards respond more effectively to their needs, it also contributes to global climate change mitigation goals.\nFor example, Mr Saer Diop Director General for the Economic Energy Agency (AEME) in Senegal said IEC standards are contributing to the achievement of ambitious targets to reduce annual carbon emissions.\nThey do this through supporting the energy efficiency of buildings, household appliances labelling schemes, public lighting and more.\n“In Senegal we believe it is highly important to increase the use of renewable energies, which is why we have implemented an incentive whereby solar equipment that is certified under the IECEE conformity assessment system is exempt from VAT. This has greatly helped to increase the development of renewable energies.”\nDr Hafez Abdel Aal El-Salmawy, Professor of Engineering at Zagazig University, Egypt said Africa is quickly gaining recognition as a potential global leader in green hydrogen production and IEC Standards are important in enabling its development.\n“Africa has been blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, but the development of the hydrogen market suffers from many uncertainties. It is important to have standards for the hydrogen value chain and the system of certification of green and proof of supply.”\nIEC Conformity Assessment Schemes underpin the value of standards in Africa.\nMr Benson Bundi, Principal Inspection Technician for Quality Inspection, IEC National Committee of Kenya outlined how the use of IECEE certificates in Kenya help to ensure consistent quality of products and services and facilitate access to international markets by aligning African products with global requirements.\n“We want to encourage other African countries to embrace IEC conformity assessment schemes because we have seen the benefits of IEC certification of imported products and we have seen an improvement of quality of electrical products in our market.”\nWatch the IEC in Africa – Africa in IEC Open Session here."

        "published_day": "2023-10-31",
        "abstract": "The IEC and ISO are working to make their standards more gender responsive. Find out how by reading this interview.",
        "content": "Sonya Bird is the Director of International Standards at UL Standards & Engagement in the US and one of the founding members of the joint strategic advisory committee on gender responsive standards. She replies to our questions on the role of gender in standards and some of the challenges experienced in getting the message across to technical experts. (Read the full interview in e-tech.)\nWhy is it important for technical committees to consider gender when they are preparing standards?\nStandards must be applicable across all genders to effectively promote the safety of the user. Gender responsive standards consider how gender impacts the technical requirements and application of standards. These considerations can range from physical and physiological differences like grip strength, physical dimensions, skin thickness and body fat percentage. Gender roles and social and cultural dimensions can also have implications for standards development depending on how these are applied.\nIs meeting SDG 5 a consideration?\nDefinitely! The IEC and ISO are committed to helping achieve the UN SDGs through standards, and considering gender in standards development can contribute to the achievement of SDG 5. By ensuring that standards are gender responsive, ISO and the IEC can promote gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls through standardization. \nCan you give some concrete examples of how standards impact gender differently in electrotechnology?\nAn example is the first edition of IEC 62209-3, which establishes a new measurement procedure for the assessment of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of human exposure to radiofrequency fields from wireless communication devices. It sets specifications for fast SAR measurement systems, using a vector-probe array solution. This system determines the 3D EM field, by using a 3D reconstruction algorithm in a phantom, a sort of mannequin or physical model of the human body. IEC Technical Committee 106, which publishes the standard, uses female and male mannequins for the testing.\nWhat do you say to experts who claim there is no gender-related difference in electrotechnology?\nIt is important to determine potential gender implications in any standard which focuses, whether directly or indirectly, on products or systems used by people. However, gender implications are not always readily apparent in electrotechnical standards.\nAll participants in the standards development process have an important role to play in ensuring that gender responsive standards are developed. To increase awareness on gender-related differences, we’re working to develop case studies as part of a toolkit for technical experts that includes examples of how specific standards are gender responsive."

        "content": "Smart Standards are “the key enabler” through which the digital transformation of industries and society can be realized.  That is the key message from a new report by the IEC Market Strategy Board.\n \nWhy is there a need for Smart Standards?\nThe report emphasizes the need for an evolution in standards to meet market expectations in the near future. It notes that the incessant increase in the complexity of products forces manufacturers to use a greater number of standards, which themselves become increasingly complex.\nBusinesses needing solutions, believe the answer lies in digitalization. Ultimately, therefore, the standards that they wish to integrate in their processes to improve efficiency and render their products safe and reliable, must also evolve digitally.\nThe report urges the IEC and its partners to develop digitally enabled standards that are machine-applicable, readable and transferable (Smart).\nSmart signifies the transformation from document-centric content towards machine-executable data. If standards become machine-readable, they would be able to support digital systems, which could in turn employ artificial intelligence as an accelerator.\nFindings of the report\nThe new report provides an economic analysis of the value of Smart Standards for the IEC and for end users. The assessment is supported by interviews from several key stakeholders to capture a broader business view.\nThree main benefits emerge:\n\n\nBetter performance: faster adaptation of standards and with fewer errors, which means end users can make better products more rapidly.\n\n\nRisk value: better alignment with legislation and industry partners and improved conformity, which diminishes the risk of litigations.\n\n\nFuture value: an assurance of future income by operating better in dynamic markets.\n\n\nThe report presents Smart Standards from a technical, market and economic perspective. Smart Standards would represent a new ISO/IEC product provided in the form of software rather than as documents and would operate at different levels of digitalization.\nAccording to the report, “Smart Standards offer a sensible way forward which stakeholders welcome”. The report says that Smart Standards will introduce new market-driven, innovative services that nudge standardization organizations toward changing into service organizations. It concludes with a set of considerations for the IEC Community.\nBeing fully customizable and adaptable to evolving market needs, smart standards can help in staying ahead of the ever-advancing tech curve.\n\nDownloading the Report\nThe MSB is responsible for identifying and investigating principle technological trends and market needs in the IEC’s fields of activity. This societal and technology trend report complements the activities being conducted within the Standardization Management Board and the Joint IEC/ISO taskforce, and can be downloaded here."

        "content": "Cyber security is one of the highest priorities for most organizations, and not surprisingly when some studies estimate the cost of cyber-crimes will increase by nearly 70% by 2028.\nCyber-attacks can have disastrous consequences on people and places, which is why most organizations have cyber security measures in place.\nBut in our increasingly connected world, protection against cyber-attacks has become more and more complex. Where once upon a time cyber security was only associated with IT, now it also encompasses operational technology (OT) systems such as the automated environment in factories or critical infrastructures.\nInternational standards are key tools in the fight against cybercrime as they contain comprehensive security measures based on best practices from experts around the world. Standards for conformity assessment such as those for testing and certification also help organizations comply with local regulations and demonstrate to their stakeholders that robust security measures are in place.\nBut not one standard fits all, and recognizing the challenges of choosing the right standards for an organization’s needs, IEC has created a standards mapping tool to help.\nDeveloped by IEC’s advisory committee on information security and data privacy, ACSEC, the tool features more than 300 international standards from the key developers of international standards for cyber security, IEC, ISO and IEEE. In this way it enables users to quickly see which standards will address their specific needs.\nIt includes horizontal standards that can be used in any domain such as Information security management systems, security evaluation, testing and specification, risk management, identity management and privacy technologies and many more.\nIt also lists standards that cover multiple domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, as well as specific sectors such as healthcare, finance, maritime, aviation and energy.\nThe mapping tool project leader, Alia Fourati, said: “With the huge number of cyber security standards that exist, this mapping tool will help standards users to quickly identify what documents will cover their specific needs. It is designed in such a way that it provides a neutral and hierarchical presentation of existing standards, based on their application domains according to their scopes and their objectives.”\nThe tool will be updated regularly to ensure it captures all new standards developed in this field.\nDiscover the cyber security standards inventory tool."

        "content": "When it comes to imagining the future of technology even the greatest minds have stumbled. Thomas Edison dismissed alternating current (AC) as a waste of time; Albert Einstein said that nuclear energy was unobtainable; and Bill Gates predicted that no-one would ever make a 32-bit operating system or need more than 637 KB of memory for a personal computer.\nLord Kelvin, who thought X-rays would prove to be a hoax and that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible, was no exception. In common with other scientific geniuses, though, he was right more often than he was wrong.\nKelvin was not only a brilliant physicist and mathematician but also a forward thinker. Beyond his famous contributions to the understanding of thermodynamics and electricity, he was one of the earliest champions of renewable energy, particularly wind power as a means of generating electricity. \nIn an age when coal was king and few if any saw alternatives, Kelvin dared to dream of harnessing the power of wind. In 1881, he delivered a speech about using windmills to charge a new battery created by the French engineer, Camille Alphonse Fauré. \nKelvin’s speech kickstarted the exploration of wind as a source of sustainable electricity. A year later, in 1882, he wrote to the editor of The Times, advocating the use of wind power in generating electricity for lighting and other purposes. \nKelvin divulged, \"I have for a long time been impressed with the idea that the wind should be made to do more work for humanity than merely furnish sailors with motive power for ships.\n“It is a subject which has been much in my mind lately, and I have been led to think that the time has come when windmills should be tried as prime movers for electric lighting. The wind is a natural force which is practically inexhaustible, and which can be utilized without any consumption of fuel or production of smoke.”\nThe burning of coal as the primary source of energy in Victorian Britain caused air pollution, acid rain and environmental damage. Kelvin imagined a sustainable future for humanity, where every building would have its own rooftop windmill to generate electricity for its machinery, elevators, water supply and lighting.\nKelvin would have been delighted that the 2023 recipient of the IEC award that bears his name has dedicated much of his life to writing standards for wind energy generation systems. Robert Sherwin has played an instrumental role in developing standards in the field of wind turbines, as well as in the establishment of the globally respected IEC conformity assessment system, IECRE."

        "content": "With accusations of greenwashing increasing, industry urgently needed independent proof that environmental and sustainability claims have been established based on agreed methodology and best practice. The IEC, through IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System is providing an independent verification service. This service, which covers net zero (based on ISO 14067), circular economy and hazardous substances use, is available to most industry sectors and for many products and devices which cater to homes, offices, manufacturing, communication and more.\n \nGeneva, Switzerland, 24 October 2023 – While pressure for more environmentally friendly products, devices, manufacturing and operational practices has steadily grown over the past years, environmental claims by private organizations are facing increasing scrutiny with accusations of greenwashing on the rise. Often claims by companies are based on proprietary methodology that is not independently verified and can’t be easily compared. This is about to change.\nIEC now offers new environmental services that are delivered by trusted, independent inspection and certification bodies who participate in IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System, which operates across more than 40 countries. The new “green portfolio” verifies environmental claims based on internationally recognized, standardized methodologies and best practice. These IECQ services focus on hazardous substances process management, environmentally conscious design (ecodesign) and carbon footprint declaration verification. They provide industries with independent verification that offers transparency and helps increase trust for environmental claims by regulators, public interest groups and consumers.\nInitially introduced for the electronics industry, IECQ has made these services adaptable and customizable, allowing them to be effectively implemented across diverse electrotechnical or related industries such as energy, communications, healthcare, finance or transport.\n“The decision to deliver these services more broadly, was approved by the IEC Conformity Assessment Board on 22 October in the context of the annual IEC General Meeting. They directly address the need to clearly and transparently demonstrate more sustainable practices across various industries and to instil confidence across international markets that products meet world-class standards for quality and sustainable practices”, says Chris Agius, IECQ Executive Secretary.\nAll IECQ certificates and verification statements are publicly accessible on the IECQ centralized online certificate system. “Having it all in one place enables manufacturers and service providers to easily demonstrate authenticity in real time and is available for instant public checking and confirmation”, added Mr Agius.\n \n \nAbout IECQ\nThe IEC Quality Assessment System, IECQ operates industry-specific global certification schemes for specialized services that support environmental sustainability, supply chain management, and manufacturing of component products, through IECQ approved Certification Bodies (CBs), many of which are well known and operating across more than 40 countries, with international IECQ certificates and verification statements publicly accessible on the IECQ centralized on-line certificate system.\nThe certification and verification services offered by the IECQ provide manufacturers and service providers with independent certification or verification based on International Standards and specifications. \nwww.iecq.org\nFor questions and further information please contact: \nThe IECQ Secretariat Team\ninfo@iecq.org"

        "abstract": "Safe disposal of e-waste poses a huge global challenge. Standards and certification can help alleviate the issue and contribute to sustainability goals.",
        "content": "On top of the growing volumes of e-waste generated by their own populations, several countries are facing an additional problem: illegal e-waste shipped from other countries. \nVarious studies conducted over the years identify China, India, Pakistan, several African countries such as Ghana and East-European countries like Ukraine, as the victims of the dumping of millions of metric tonnes illegal e-waste from developed nations.\nThe final recipients of this e-waste often lack adequate legislation or infrastructure to properly manage the e-waste, resulting in health and environmental hazards. Proper disposal of e-waste everywhere, poses a huge challenge for our society.\nBut there is still hope. Sustainable Development Goal 12 for ensuring responsible consumption and production patterns, set by the UN aims to tackle this very issue. There’s demand for tighter regulation and better infrastructure, which is where standards play a vital role.\nIEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems can contribute to correcting the situation.\nDiscover more about the story and the standards in-depth in the e-tech article.\nChallenges\nThe authors of Africa Clean Energy’s E-Waste Policy Handbook mention that the most common challenges include insufficient data in e-waste stocks and flows, deeply rooted informal sectors, limited capacity and lack of awareness.\nWe spoke to manager at non-profit organization (NPO) CLASP Monica Wambui,  who has worked a great deal with on-the-ground stakeholders in the e-waste industry in Africa, confirmed the same.\nShe explained that high costs are a big issue along with the informal systems.  The disposal of e-waste is largely reliant on such scrap traders, who often work independently or in unregulated systems. But the same challenge is also an opportunity for leveraging solutions:  an effective solution may be found with governments understanding and adapting to these existing niche systems, and working together with the people whose livelihoods depend on it.\nSolutions with a circular approach\nWambui says, “Industry alone cannot solve the issue. Collaboration is key. It is beneficial to both investors and governments if development and implementation of proper e-waste management practices are encouraged and increased support is made available for innovations where possible.”\n\"Different solutions are needed depending on the maturity of a market,\" added Charles Miller, an energy access consultant who has done extensive work in the area.\" He explained that nascent markets would need more incentives and support , whereas more mature markets stronger policy/regulatory frameworks for responsible practices in controlling and managing flow of e-waste are needed.\nCrucial to the success of such policies is also the active engagement of consumers, who, if made aware and supported through financial incentives, are empowered to make more sustainable choices like returning goods to repair shops or disposing of material at designated e-waste recycling centres.\n“To reduce e-waste in Africa and emerging economies, we must have a much better focus on reparability of appliances and equipment,” says Jeremy Tait, another authority in energy efficiency policies in emerging ecosystems, stressing on the importance of circular models that extend product lifespan and reduce volume of e-waste.\nHow standards can help to change the game\nIn the international standardization arena, the IEC has already developed several publications to support material efficiency and the circular economy. Additionally, IEC 62430 sets requirements and provides guidance on implementing environmentally conscious design (ECD). IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, tests and provides certification to IEC 62430, as part of its approved process (AP) scheme.\nAccording to Christian Dworak, Convenor of the IEC working group on e-waste (IEC TC 111 WG 18), “Electronic products are designed for and distributed in a worldwide market. After the products have been used in different regions of the world, the concept of extended producer responsibility has to ensure that those products will be collected and recycled in a sustainable way. As there is not yet any worldwide harmonized/single concept of implementing extended producer responsibility, regional cooperation between authorities, e-waste collectors, recyclers and producers is key to ensure a sustainable management of e-waste in the region.”\nThe IEC is preparing a new standard, IEC 63395, for the systematic, sustainable management of e-waste, with a focus on extended producer responsibilities. This step would also advance work towards SDG 12 and pave the way for more solutions to come.\nBesides TC 111, IEC also has a dedicated advisory committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) which guides IEC's efforts in ensuring its standards are conscious about environmental impact.\nFor more information:\nThe dire need for regulation and standards in global e-waste management"

        "abstract": "The IEC and ISO joint committee on artificial intelligence (AI), SC 42, has started work on a new standard to promote the responsible deployment of AI technologies in safety-critical applications.",
        "content": "In an effort to promote the responsible deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for use in safety-critical applications, the IEC and ISO joint committee on AI, SC 42, have started work on a new standard to advance the functional safety of AI systems.\nThe standard to be developed, ISO/IEC TS 22440, will be instrumental in ensuring reliability across AI applications in a wide number of areas where safety is paramount, such as for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and industrial control systems. It will build upon the technical report ISO/IEC TR 5469, which is currently in its final publication stage.\nFunctional safety is a discipline that aims to ensure systems, equipment and devices operate as intended. Functional safety standards are important for any industry where systems can cause harm to people, property or the environment if they fail.\nISO/IEC TS 22440 will be developed by a newly formed joint working group, JWG 4, involving SC 42 and IEC TC 65/SC 65A, who has been a key player in the domain of functional safety for many years. SC 65A is known for its work on the IEC 61508 series of standards, which cover the design and implementation of safeguards to prevent accidents and minimize safety risks across various industries.\nJWG 4 will include contributions from stakeholders from a wide range of domains to ensure it can address the unique safety challenges presented by different AI applications.\nThe new standard is expected to be a robust framework to handle AI-related hazards effectively. The main areas of its focus will include:\n\n\nRisk assessment and hazard analysis\n\tThe publication will likely emphasize the importance of thorough risk assessments and hazard analyses to identify potential failure modes and assess their probabilities. Understanding these risks is fundamental to developing effective mitigation strategies.\n\n\nTransparency and explainability\n\tAddressing the opacity of AI systems, the publication will likely encourage the use of techniques that improve transparency and explainability. This includes methods to interpret AI decision-making processes, allowing engineers to gain insights into system behaviour and potential failure modes.\n\n\nValidation and verification\n\tThe publication will likely outline validation and verification processes to ensure that AI systems meet safety requirements. This may involve simulating and testing the system’     s response to various fault scenarios, evaluating its robustness, and assessing its compliance with safety specifications.\n\n\nSafety analysis\n\tSafety analysis techniques may play a critical role in estimating the likelihood of failures and assessing system performance under different conditions.\n\n\nRiccardo Mariani, SC 42 convenor of JWG 4 said: “AI brings unprecedented opportunities and benefits to our society. By tapping the expertise of standards bodies like IEC and ISO, we can build a robust foundation for AI safety to support critical sector-specific functional safety initiatives.” \nAudrey Canning, liaison officer from SC 65A to SC 42 said: “For the benefits of AI to be realized in practical safety critical applications, it is important to show how it can satisfy current regulations, standards and good practices. The maintenance committee of IEC 61508 (MT 61508) welcomes this initiative in providing a common understanding of where and how to use AI to optimum benefit.”\nKoji Demachi, chair of SC 65A said: “Functional safety isn't just a precaution. it can be a catalyst for AI innovation, clearing the path for novel technologies, market access and policy alignment. The creation of JWG 4 and the development of this new standard is a positive step forward for the future of AI.\"\nWael William Diab, chair of SC 42 said: “A core tenet for SC 42 is the broad responsible adoption of AI to benefit society while simultaneously addressing technological concerns. The joint work with SC 65A furthers that goal significantly by opening up a vast number of application domains where functional safety is essential.”\nSC 42 organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight.\nThe fourth bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop will be held in December and will cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nLearn more about functional safety."

        "abstract": "The recent plenary meeting of IEC TC 106 was an opportunity to look back as well as ahead to how TC experts will work in 2033.",
        "content": "The recent plenary meeting of IEC Technical Committee 106 (TC 106) was my last as Chair. It was an opportunity to look back at our achievements of the past nine years, which I’ll save for another blog post, as well as to look forward and imagine what the plenary and our work will look like 10 years from now. \nFor readers not familiar with our work, TC 106 prepares international standards on measurement and calculation methods to assess human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. The TC brings together global experts from mobile operators, mobile manufacturers, academia, government regulators and testing laboratories.\nIn terms of looking forward, we are now in an excellent position to fully embrace emerging technologies, such as significant advancements in computer modelling capabilities, the metaverse, and AI. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize how standards are developed in the future.\nBut we need to approach these opportunities with an open mind and a forward-looking vision, embracing the innovative perspectives that young professionals bring, rather than remaining stuck in the past. Here is how I believe the IEC TC 106 Plenary will look in 2033.\nSimplified standards development\nIn the next decade, the days of emailing drafts and working offline will become a distant memory. Online systems, which TC 106 has already been involved with in trials, will become the primary mode of operation. \nThis transition will offer substantial time savings, instantaneous review and real-time commenting. We will soon start wondering why it took us so long to adopt this approach!\nOur IEC Young Professionals (YPs) joining from universities are already amazed by our current hybrid early online approach compared to their university experiences. In the future, national committees and experts will review documents and drafts in real time, leading to smoother processes and expert analysis. \nOnline project management systems will have advanced significantly, providing timely progress updates, feedback, and scheduling. As a result, development time will be optimized in this new digital era.\nTechnical writing\nImproving the readability and comprehensibility of our technical documents while maintaining technical accuracy will be a significant advantage in the digital and AI era. Our experts typically have a strong background in technology and science but may not be writing specialists. \nAI advancements have the potential to transform our technical documents into standards that are much easier to read and follow. While technical accuracy checks remain fundamental, AI can greatly enhance readability and usability. \nPreviously, TC 106 has employed technical writers to support our work, but this can be expensive. I am convinced that the IEC's new \"AI Technical Writer\" will be incorporated fully into online authoring systems, allowing experts to prepare content as they do now, with the AI suggesting improvements for readability. \nArrangements will also be made to access similar technical content when collaborating with other standards organizations, ensuring seamless integration.\n\nWays of working\nThe traditional working methods of 2033 will differ significantly from those of the post-COVID era in 2023 when hybrid meetings were still common. Metaverse-enabled \"Virtual Round Table Forums,\" using technologies such as Zoom and Teams, will evolve into metaverse-driven virtual roundtables where participants will feel as though they are in the same room. \nInitially trialled at the IEC GM in Frankfurt decades ago, these virtual experiences will involve virtual glasses, headsets and ultra-HD large round screens. Collaboration boards, breakout coffee chats, and a sense of presence will enhance the virtual experience. \nSmaller working groups, organized by regional time zones or expertise, will become the norm during the online development phase. Face-to-face engagement will remain essential for important strategic interactions, with experts and leaders aiming for at least one collective meeting each year for TCs. \nRecognizing that experts work flexibly and sometimes cannot travel, these engagements will be accommodated with virtual rooms when necessary. Young Professionals, having grown up in the digital world, will lead the development of these systems, bringing fresh perspectives that challenge traditional standards experts. \nThe process may present challenges, but continuous trials and visionary approaches will lead to success.\nAdvanced safety assessments\nIn the next decade, traditional mobile device compliance testing, carried out with advanced robotic measurement systems, will be replaced by significant advances in computational modelling techniques and AI. This transition offers significant opportunities for device manufacturers, allowing them to accurately assess compliance from the design phase through to production, particularly for devices with multiple frequencies, which require time-consuming safety testing. \nI foresee a significant shift towards AI-based compliance assessments, supported by laboratory system validations. To extend this opportunity further, the IEC could potentially offer an online \"SAR Conformity Assessment Modelling Application\" where manufacturers can upload beta and final designs for instant compliance analysis and verification. \nThis online system would automatically update when standards are revised. The IEC's compliance systems could be licensed to manufacturers, ensuring the protection of intellectual property and data. \nI predict that Young Professionals who haven't even joined the IEC yet will lead the digitization of advanced SAR modelling and compliance systems, leading to a revolutionary improvement in device testing and safety. \nThe IEC conformity assessment team will collaborate with TC 106 experts and regulators to ensure the adoption of the best technology. Independent laboratories and regulators will conduct after-market surveillance audits and measurements to maintain the rigour of the modelling systems.\nDigital twins for mobile network facility safety assessments\nIn the next decade, I foresee wireless, telecommunications, and broadcasting facilities adopting digital twin models as part of new smart city and facility management systems. This transformation will revolutionize how facilities are managed, including electromagnetic field (EMF) safety and interference EMC assessments. \nThe challenge of acquiring accurate system data for buildings, towers, and infrastructure used for transmitting antennas and systems will be addressed through online modelling for EMF assessments, which will be integrated with advanced digital twin models of facilities. The IEC standards can be directly incorporated into digital twin EMF assessment systems, facilitating assessment from the design to the build stage. \nSystem validation via measurement will ensure accuracy. The IEC Conformity Assessment System will feature an advanced validation scheme for EMF modelling that automatically applies the IEC standards. Regulators and facility managers will have access to IEC systems for network compliance validation. \nIEC conformity assessment will also validate external modelling schemes.\nFuture technologies – 6G advanced and the metaverse\nIn the next decade, 6G technology will be in the early stages of deployment, connecting billions of devices and sensors that have become commonplace in society. This technological advancement will empower the metaverse of the future, leading to smart cities becoming a requirement in local government planning schemes. \nMobile operators will need to adapt their business models to meet community and business requirements. All schools, universities, and colleges will operate fully wireless, synchronized with local smart cities and educational platforms. \nWireless networks will have evolved into a significantly denser grid, featuring distributed small cells, indoor nodes like Wi-Fi, and outdoor base stations. The increased demand for network capacity will require many new frequency bands allocated by governments to complement existing 5G networks.\nTo meet these evolving needs, TC 106 must transition from separate \"network\" and \"devices\" assessment standards to a more holistic assessment model facilitated through IEC online assessment platforms and applications. \nGoing fully digital will enable us to capture the potential of smart cities and ensure the seamless integration of international assessment standards.\nGlobal thought leadership and future vision\nLeadership and seizing these opportunities demand a positive vision, an open mindset, and a willingness to be thought leaders in future standardization. I encourage all IEC Technical Committees to embrace the enthusiasm and vision that Young Professionals bring to the IEC, providing them with leadership opportunities to drive our future initiatives. \nIn June, I shared 10 steps for keeping up with rapidly evolving technology and improving standards development. My top recommendation is to have fun and make standards development an enjoyable experience. This approach enhances team dynamics, making it more rewarding and attracting experts eager to join our efforts."

        "abstract": "Functional safety in AI systems is a key topic at the bi-annual plenary for the joint IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, held next week.",
        "content": "Wherever we go and whatever we do, we are generally never too far from an electrical or electronic device or system. Ensuring they are safe and don’t cause us intolerable harm is the objective behind functional safety. It focuses on electronics and related software and activates built-in safety mechanisms to reduce potential risks that could harm or destroy something, or someone.\nIt is found almost everywhere, from airplanes to industrial machines and medical devices, to name a few.\nFor example, automatic doors have built-in sensors that open fast enough so you don’t squash your nose, and close slowly enough behind you so you aren’t stuck halfway.\nThe sensors in smoke detectors activate a water sprinkler system to douse any fires, and overflow valves, used in a variety of settings such as plumbing and electricity generation, alerts users when certain pressure levels are reached.\nFunctional safety standards are designed to ensure the safety and reliability of the software that enables this automatic protection.\nIEC 61508 is a horizontal series of standards that provides functional safety requirements applicable to a wide range of industry sectors. It requires the analysis of the potential risks or hazards of a given system or device and provides categories to determine the level of likelihood of a potential hazard and the consequences should it occur. It ensures risk reduction through Safety Integrity Levels (SILs).\nSILs are defined to indicate the degree to which a system will meet its specified safety functions.\nIEC TC 65, known for its work on the IEC 61508 series of standards, has been a key player in the domain of functional safety for many years. These standards cover the design and implementation of safeguards to prevent accidents and minimize risks across various industries.\nSpecifically, the IEC 61508 is a horizontal series of standards that provides functional safety requirements applicable to a wide range of industry sectors. It mandates the analysis of the potential risks or hazards of a given system or device and provides categories to determine the level of likelihood of a potential hazard and its consequences, should it occur.\nAI is increasingly used in safety-critical systems such as autonomous systems and autonomous mobile robots. Functional safety of AI, therefore, needs to be considered as this technology evolves.\nSC 42 organizes regular workshops on AI to discuss emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications as well as the role of standards. They bring together innovators at the frontier of AI development from diverse locations, sectors and backgrounds involved in research, deployment, standardization, startups, applications and oversight.\nThe fourth bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop will be held in December and will cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nFunctional safety will be one of the topics broached at the second bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop in December. The workshop will cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements."

        "abstract": "The wind turbine market is continuing to expand, thanks to offshore and floating wind installations and spectacular growth in Asia. Recycling and reusing turbines is becoming an issue.",
        "content": "Wind turbine capacity has greatly increased over time. In 1985, typical turbines had a rated capacity of 0,05 megawatt (MW). The most recent offshore turbines now produce 15 to 16 MW of electricity each.\nOffshore wind capability has been growing for the last 10 years and wind turbines have become considerably bigger, with blades of the tallest windmills reaching diameters of up to 250 metres. These big installations need room, and where there is not enough land space, offshore becomes a solution. The power of the wind is also much stronger offshore and generates more electricity than inland windfarms.\nA new trend is the installation of floating offshore wind turbines. Unlike conventional offshore turbines, they do not require fixing to the ground below the sea and can be built further away from the land. Fixed offshore installations, on the contrary, must be installed in relatively shallow waters. Floating turbines are anchored to the seabed by means of flexible anchors and chains and deliver electricity through underwater cables.\nAnother important trend for the wind industry has been the focus on the life extension, decommissioning and recycling of wind turbines. Many installations have been up and running for more than 20 years and need to be re-assessed, to check if they can continue to operate, or need to be decommissioned and eventually recycled.\n\"“Wind has become a mature and multi-billion industry, which is having to meet new challenges. One of them is the life cycle of wind turbines. Originally wind turbine blades were made of epoxy resin and other materials which are difficult to recycle. IEC Technical Committee 88, which prepares standards for wind energy generation systems, is developing two technical specifications, IEC TS 61400-28 and IEC TS 61400-28-2 which deal with through-life management, life extension and recycling. IECRE is working hand in hand with the technical committee, and we are about to produce operational documents in relation to these new technical specifications. The idea is to assess whether some wind turbines which have in theory reached their life-end can still operate for a few years. Life-extension of the turbines not only offers a financial gain to the operator but also fits in with a circular economy approach, which is better for the planet,” says Alistair Mackinnon, Chair of IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "Places that do not have adequate access to electricity risk financial exclusion, which is regarded as one of the primary causes of poverty and social inequality. This point was raised in a recent webinar by Alliance for Rural Electrification (ARE) on Energy Storage and Green Hydrogen.\nSpeakers from a diverse range of organizations working on enabling rural electrification, discussed the challenges and opportunities in providing energy access. IEC plays a critical role in this area.\nIEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems help establish frameworks and practices to ensure energy access for safe and reliable electricity supply, even in rural areas which might require certain adaptations based on the environment.\n \nWhy is financial inclusion important?\nFinancial inclusion involves access to and use of a broad range of affordable and quality financial services. Not being financially included means diminished access to services like banks, or being able to take loans, or getting your insurance.\nThis is especially pronounced in poorer households, where there is a lack of access due to their socio-economic environment. Policymakers and economists have long recognised the potential role of financial inclusion in alleviating poverty.\nBut an important part of financial inclusion, is ensuring that such services are affordable and easily accessible to those that are excluded either because of poverty or infrastructural limitations such as no electricity access.\n \nHow can energy access enable financial inclusion?\nAround 13% of the world population has no electricity access, which further limits their access to the largely digitalized financial (and other) services in everyday life.\nEnabling energy access is therefore the first step towards improving the situation.  However, often geographical or economic barriers make it problematic to connect to power grids supplying electricity 24/7. \nIn such cases, decentralized or off-grid autonomous power systems are the answer – allowing basic electricity access to households and community services like banks, administrative centres, health centres, and more.\nThe same was echoed by the panel of experts who spoke at the ARE webinar who shared their work in rural electrification – like enabling mobile payment setups, off-grid green-hydrogen power supply setups for hospitals, and other sustainable energy storage solutions like water, wind and solar.\nIt is in this context that one of the speakers, Thony Ngumbu explained how his organization was aiming to provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy as a platform for financial inclusion.  \nTo elaborate, consider how having an energy backup allows the bank to run properly, connect to smart services that make the management or processing much easier for the bank – helping both the bank and the people it serves, to have wider access to quality.\n \nHow is IEC helping?\nIEC is working for sustainable, resilient, and affordable energy services on and off-grid. \nThe IEC 62257 series provides a planned and tested approach for rural electrification projects.\nIEC TC 82 issues a series of technical specifications (TS) that make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. It allows project developers, implementers and installers to select the right system for the right place. A joint working group between IEC TC 82 and IEC TC 21 also publishes standards relating to batteries for on-grid and off-grid energy storage.\nThe IEC systems committee for LVDC works on making Low voltage direct current (LVDC) technology safe, reliable, and affordable. The technology is particularly relevant to rural electrification to efficiently power lighting systems, various household appliances and mobiles or laptops.\nThere are several other ways that IEC contributes to creating energy access – The challenge of energy storage is also taken up through projects in the IEC Global Impact Fund.\nWhen it comes to using green hydrogen storage systems for power supply, IECEx CA Systems are relevant, which for years has been covering certification for equipment, services, and competence of persons in areas associated with hydrogen. IECRE focuses on renewable energy systems; IECEE verifies lighting, household devices, PV modules, etc.\nBy furthering energy access, rural populations are empowered to make use of financial and other services that can massively improve the quality of their lives.\n \nRead more:\nIEC work for rural electrification"

        "content": "IEC President Jo Cops called on fellow international standards development organisations ISO and ITU to join IEC in reshaping our world for the better through a digital and all-electric society.\nSpeaking at ISO’s Annual Meeting held in Brisbane, Australia, Mr Cops emphasized how the digital and all-electric society aligns with all of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly number seven, which seeks universal access to affordable, reliable and clean energy services.\nThe digital and all-electric society is about helping to build a more energy-sustainable future doesn't compromise our planet's health but empowers people everywhere to lead healthy, safe, secure and meaningful lives, he said.\nBut, he said, IEC cannot achieve this alone. ISO, ITU and IEC share common values and aspirations and already collaborate on a number of important projects such as the World Standards Cooperation.\n\n“The path we tread is one that demands a collective approach, one that demands partnerships and alliances that transcend sectors and industries. Together, we can provide the tools and expertise to build a world where intelligent, green energy coexists harmoniously with cutting-edge communication and digital technologies\".\n\nClash of the generations\nIEC Secretary General Philippe Metzger was also present at the event, speaking on the panel ‘Clash of the Generations’ about the importance of engaging young talent in standardization.\n\nIEC is committed to engaging the young generation through fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment and welcoming their ideas and perspectives.\n\n“Our present and future is already being influenced by their creativity and innovation, and it's essential that we leverage their energy even more to be a positive force for change in standards and conformity assessment activities,” he said.\n\nIEC does this through the IEC Young Professionals (YP) Programme. The IEC YP Programme empowers YPs to make a difference in the future of the electrotechnical industry. By actively participating and contributing their ideas, they can influence the direction of technological advancements, promote sustainability, and shape the industry's response to emerging challenges such as climate change and digital transformation.\nThrough workshops, training sessions, and networking events, the Programme offers valuable opportunities for young professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge in standardization processes, technical areas, and leadership skills.\nParticipants also get global exposure and networking opportunities through engaging in international standardization activities, attend IEC meetings and events, and collaborate with experts from around the world.\nISO and IEC joint committee on artificial intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) was also a key topic during the event, as discussions were held around how AI-based solutions are changing the standards market.\nRecognizing the significant achievements in standardization in this field, the joint IEC and ISO Committee on AI, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 42 was this year’s winner of ISO’s Lawrence D. Eicher Leadership (LDE) Award.\nThe LDE Award provides recognition for superior performance by one of the ISO standards development groups.\n\nAccepting the award, SC 42 Chair Wael William Diab said AI has the capacity to improve our world for the better, but we need to do this responsibly.\n\n“Many analysts would agree that we are at an inflection point with AI. It is precisely at this point where international standards can play the role in simultaneously unlocking the potential of AI while ensuring a trustworthy adoption. Put differently, international standards are part of the solution that will connect the rapid technology innovation with societal requirements.”"

        "content": "Over the last few years, many targets have been achieved in terms of electrification globally, but when you look at figures on the African continent, a far less upbeat picture comes to the fore. According to the 2023 UN publication, Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report, COVID-19 actually slowed electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa and the situation has not much improved since then. The steady rise in energy prices since the summer of 2021 is a further drag on progress, particularly in the most vulnerable countries and those that were already lagging behind.\nAccording to the report, in 2021, 675 million people still lacked access to electricity. Of those, 567 million live in Sub-Saharan Africa – accounting for more than 80% of the global population with no access to electricity. The report also notes that international financial support for clean energy to developing countries decreased by around 60% since its peak of USD 26,4 billion in 2017.\nUnless urgent improvements are made, the targets of SDG 7 are not going to be met by 2030, warns the report. To meet these targets, especially for people living in poor and remote regions, the annual access growth rate must double.\nAfrica gets many more hours of brilliant sunlight than any other continent on Earth. It has an ideal climate to make full use of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, which is well suited to the continent for other reasons too. Solar PV panels can be installed on roofs without being connected to national grids. These installations enable electricity access for remote locations, which are not reached by a national electricity network.\nSeveral IEC documents relating to solar PV installations have been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and can help solar PV really take off in Africa. The IEC 62257 series of technical specifications makes recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. They include IEC TS 62257-9-8, which sets the baseline requirements for the quality, durability and accuracy for stand-alone renewable energy products with the aim of protecting consumers. The evaluation of these requirements uses the test methods defined in IEC TS 62257-9-5. All of them are based on the Quality Assurance Framework and Quality Standards established by Lighting Global (World Bank) to rapidly increase access to off-grid solar energy for the hundreds of millions of people living without electricity worldwide. This standards series can be accessed by developing nations at a much-discounted price.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "The World Economic Forum called water scarcity one of the greatest challenges of our time. The UN has urged members to speed up implementation of the UN-Water SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework warning that “business as usual will not achieve that goal”.  The SDG 6 framework states that water-related challenges require the rapid development and deployment of innovative and transformative ideas. These approaches include water extraction and preservation techniques and the extensive use of IT and AI to help communities optimize water resources and minimize the environmental impact of water use. \nDesalination is an established technique that pumps water at high pressure through membranes to remove salt and other chemicals from the sea or brackish river water but is increasingly controversial, mostly for environmental reasons. One of the much heard criticisms is that the reverse osmosis process used in most industrial desalination efforts is energy intensive. However, green energy is increasingly powering such systems. In California, a state prone to drought, the Doheny Ocean Desalination Project will provide 5 million gallons of drinking water for 40 000 people a day by 2028. It aims to power around 15% of its output with solar panels and will integrate an energy recovery process resulting in what it claims is “45% to 55% less energy usage” than a system without that feature.\nAtmospheric water, which is present regardless of geographical and hydrologic conditions, is emerging as an alternative water resource. The earth’s atmosphere holds water in the form of droplets or vapour, accounting for up to 10% of freshwater sources and providing around 50 000 km3 water according to researchers.\nIncreased demand for solar-generated electricity to replace fossil fuels could also help save water. Less than one per cent of the world’s solar installations are currently floating on inland sites like reservoirs. If more floating photovoltaics (FPV) were installed, they could prevent water loss from evaporation.\nIEC TC 82 prepares international standards for solar PV systems, for example IEC 61701 which specifies testing for salt mist corrosion, concerning PV modules situated in a marine environment. One of its working groups is preparing a technical report, which is to provide guidelines for safe, reliable and well-performing floating solar systems. Read the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "The world is drowning in data, with some 2,5 quintillion bytes of it being generated each day. For cities this can be a goldmine or a minefield. Cities that are ‘smart’ see the potential this data can offer them in creating a sustainable future but need to use the right tools to be able to make sense of the data and use it wisely.\n This is no mean feat for smart cities as they generate large volumes of data from a wide range of sources such as schools, shops, healthcare facilities, utilities and transport systems. The data is collected in various ways such as from things like real-time sensors for air pollution, water meters, aerial photos, administration and much more.\nWhat’s more they are complex and their systems and infrastructures are interdependent and interconnected.\nOntologies are a way of helping cities see how everything within any system of interest fits together. By defining the concepts and relationships of the different properties of a subject, they provide greater levels of interoperability, linkability and traceability of digital content. They enable a greater level of interpretation that can then inform intelligent decision making.\nStandards clearly have an important role. ISO/IEC 21972:2020, Information technology – Upper level ontology for smart city indicators, establishes general principles and gives guidelines for smart cities that enables the representation of indicator definitions and the data used to derive them.\nConcept and data models are also useful tools to help cities wade through the data pile and see how everything fits together.\nData models organize elements of data and standardize how they relate to one another and real world-entities. The ISO/IEC 5087 series is designed to help in the development of common data models by providing a precise, unambiguous representation of common terms. It enables data sets and data streams to be combined to get greater insights into what is going on in the city.\nDigital twins are another useful way in which cities can use their data. City planners can, for example, recreate their city and test different types of infrastructure or transportation systems to see the impact they have.\nThese are just some of the ways that standards can help cities make best use of their data to contribute to achieve their sustainability objectives and provide an acceptable quality of life for their citizens.  \nTo learn more see the latest issue of e-tech."

        "content": "Lighting design in water sports goes beyond just letting people see clearly – yes, it does ensure that a spectator can actually see the swimmers rather than the glare reflected in the water; but more importantly, there’s the crucial element of safety to be kept in mind. It is essential that the different lighting fixtures around water are protected against humidity and accidental electrical leakage.\nThis is where IEC International Standards have been ensuring, almost since the beginning of electrical lights, that the technology involved meets the required safety and performance specifications.\nRead the full article in e-tech.\nMany advantages of lighting design\nWith water sports, different needs and adjustments can contribute to thoughtful lighting underwater or around. For instance, tilted lighting or secondary reflections can be used to avoid glare, and help prevent accidents. Other factors like strobe lighting treatment, lighting height, colour and uniformity needs for television broadcast when necessary, or switching to more energy-efficient options like light emitting diode (LED) technology must also be considered. \nHow the IEC helps protect the lights and the swimmers\nSpeaking of LEDs, IEC experts recognize the need for international standards to be set for not only safe, but also efficient lighting technologies. Hans-Gerd Kaiser, Chair of IEC SC 34D, a subcommittee dedicated to luminaires in contact with water, gave an example, of such work:\n“LED lights offer more energy savings and are increasingly being used both for underwater and flood lighting. As with other electrical lighting, the IEC has been leading the path for safety measures and optimum performance specifications for LED lights as well. For instance, SC 34D has updated IEC 60598-1, a generic standard which establishes general requirements and tests for luminaires to include LEDs.”\nTo protect lighting fixtures in an indoor pool against chlorine and corrosion, it must have the appropriate Ingress protection (IP) ratings. IP ratings were developed by the IEC to grade the resistance of an enclosure against the intrusion of dust or liquids.\nIEC Standards help ensure safety of electrical installations underwater or in areas with high humidity:\n\n\nIEC TC 64, publishes IEC 60364-7-702, which applies to swimming pools and specifies how to select and install electrical equipment near or under water to protect against electric shock.\n\n\nSC 34D issues IEC 62722-2-1 which specifies the performance requirements for LED luminaires, together with the test methods and conditions and IEC 60598-2-18 on the requirements for swimming pool lights.\n\n\nIEC TC 70 publishes a key standard, IEC 60529, which rates water resistance using the IP rating code.\n\n\nSC 34D publishes IEC 60598-2-5, which specifies requirements for floodlights on supply sources not exceeding 1000 V.\n\n\nIECQ scheme for LED lighting provides a quality management platform that certifies component suppliers and the manufacturing processes of LED lighting products. This scheme has been set up to guard against the risk of low-quality and unreliable products entering the market.\nAndreas Scholtz who’s the chair of IEC Technical Committee 34, the leading IEC TC on lighting standards shared how IEC continues to keep up with innovation in lighting solutions, “In the technical committee, we are in the centre of the market. Different stakeholders raise the various concerns and challenges for innovation in the industry, which feeds into effective standardization.”\nWhile developments in lighting design and their use in a better sporting experience will continue to emerge, the IEC’s work will be crucial to defining specifications for safer equipment and efficient performance of these influential lights."

Worldwide, around 240 commercial 5G networks have been launched. 5G subscriptions are forecast to reach 4,6 billion globally by the end of 2028, making up more than 50 % of all mobile subscriptions.\n5G mobile technology can pave the way for new immersive experiences such as virtual or augmented reality (VR and AR) with faster, more uniform data rates and lower cost-per-bit. 5G will also be a key enabler of artificial intelligence systems, as it will enable real-time data collection and analysis. At the same time, it can boost cloud-related technologies by enabling the distribution of computing and storage, such as edge computing, throughout the infrastructure.\nMobile devices are now an established part of the fan experience at events. That’s part of the reason why 80-plus stadiums and arenas in the United States use 5G Ultra Wideband mmWave frequencies, providing a broadband-like connection, giving users connected to it the freedom to experience and share events in new ways. The importance of connectivity for major sporting events is growing. Apps can allow visitors to order food and drinks without leaving their seats and see what they look like in their team’s kit.\nIn stadiums equipped with 5G, the service can offer seven streams of HD video to a smartphone, allowing fans to control the angle or view they want to watch and rewind the video feeds to see instant replays.

        "content": "6G, quantum technologies, the metaverse, artificial intelligence … where are communications technologies headed and how will standards help? The new IEC Systems Committee (SyC) on communications technologies and architectures (COMM) outlined its vision in a recent IEC Academy webinar.\nWe think we live in a digital and connected world already, but in just a few years from now the landscape could look wildly different. According to estimates by the IEC SyC Comm, by as soon as 2030 we will be in the 6G era with seamless space-air-ground integrated coverage and an impressive 10 gigabit access experience.\nThey predict that communication and sensors will be taken to new levels, with applications such as drones sensing beyond the line of sight and increased precision for connected vehicles, smart manufacturing and high-speed rail.\nOther forecasts are that there will be 200 billion internet connections globally, Internet Protocol version 6 (iPv6) adoption will reach 90%, the average monthly data use on wireless cellular networks for personal use will increase 40 fold to reach 600gb and gigabit or higher fiber broadband household penetration will increase by 50 times over to reach 55%.\nIntrinsic security and native trustworthiness will become the foundation of communications networks and there will be system-level innovation to drive network energy efficiency up 100 times what it is currently.\nYun Chao Hu, IEC SyC COMM Chair said standards will underpin this technology as it enables interoperability and integration.\n“Standards will help the technology not only to reach its potential but also be developed in a responsible and secure way,” he said.\nCommunication technologies play an essential role and growing influence in driving digital transformation and convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) across most IEC committees.  Examples include 5G, new networking architectures (e.g. time sensitive, software defined, autonomic) and digital twins.\nHowever, there are many standards in this field supporting such technologies, and many standards development organizations (SDOs).\nMany of these technologies are specified in organizations or consortia outside of the IEC, yet their work has a potentially high impact on the work done by IEC committees. Application-specific requirements towards communication technology standards are increasingly defined in domain-specific associations or industry consortia.\n“It is clear that no single organization today can cover the whole spectrum of communication standards,” said Mr Hu.\n“There is therefore a pressing need to ensure smooth and effective coordination and cooperation between the IEC and relevant external bodies.”\nFor this reason the SyC was born, aimed at facilitating and advising in the domain of communication technologies and architectures to advance and harmonize communication technology related activities in the IEC. Collaboration with other SDOs and industry consortia is key.\nOutlining their refined vision and latest activities at a recent IEC Academy webinar, the committee shared the status of a number of projects underway to achieve this goal.\nThis includes disseminating detailed information on new communications technologies, emerging market trends, business and development models across IEC committees and Conformity Assessment Systems, to help develop a common understanding across the IEC.\nThe SyC is also working on a communications standards mapping tool to identify gaps in standardization. It will establish a discussion platform on overarching communication technology and architecture issues, requirements and standards gaps. It will support IEC technical committees to develop their own communication standards or use specifications coming from other organizations.\nTo this end it has established two working groups: WG 1 will cover communications technologies and architectures and will develop a number of deliverables such as digital transformation guidelines, standards mapping and spectrum requirements and the motivations, issues, and potential solutions, for deploying IPv6 in enterprise and industrial networks.\nWG3 will focus on the specific application domains such as smart manufacturing, smart energy, smart healthcare etc, evaluating use cases and collaborate with WG 1 to fill gaps based on their mapping of needs.\nMr Hu said the task is big but with many benefits.\n“For users of standards in industry, we will provide guidelines on what kinds of communications technologies and relevant standards are applicable for a specific application field. Communications organizations will have guidance on which application fields their products are suitable for and SDOs on where their standards are relevant.”\n“By taking a holistic view of communications technologies activities and harmonizing the needs, requirements and offerings of standards across this broad field, we can help to build a better, connected future for all.”"

        "content": "As we move towards an all-electric and connected society, the interference from electro-magnetic (EM) waves is expected to grow extensively. Updates of the current EMC standards are required to limit these disturbances, yet not all stakeholders agree on how these should be adjusted. In the following interview extract, CISPR Chair Bettina Funk  lists the challenges ahead which are considerable. (Read the full interview in e-tech).\nHow would you describe your role as Chair of CISPR?\nI am essentially a facilitator but sometimes have to be a bit more of an enforcer in order to get things done. We are currently facing many challenges, some of which result from the way EMC work is organized in the IEC. CISPR and IEC TC 77 are the two committees in the IEC that specialize in EMC standardization, and the mandatory IEC Guide 107 tells all the other IEC committees how to use our results in their work. Within CISPR, we have six quite independent subcommittees (SCs). CISPR/A deals with test methods and CISPR/H deals with generic limits and the model to calculate limits, so these two SCs do the horizontal work referred to in IEC Guide 107. CISPR/B, D, F and I are dealing with specific product groups or environments and base their work on the results of CISPR/A and CISPR/H. This can lead to conflict when the horizontal SCs either cannot provide methods or models fast enough or when there is disagreement on whether a new method or model is needed and how it should be used.\nAny other challenges?\nThere are so many! One of the most important ones is that we must convince industry stakeholders that we need to adjust the current limits and parameters for EMC. Some of the current limits were agreed upon decades ago and some are no longer fit for purpose as we move towards an all-electric and, especially, an all-connected society. This is because the electromagnetic environment has changed over time and will continue to change in the future. Before, we simply didn’t have so many electrical products everywhere and some of the protection distances that our current limits are based upon are 10 metres or more, which was adequate in the 1970s.\nJust to give you one example of the changing electromagnetic environment; we now have solar panels on roofs mushrooming everywhere, even off-grid, some of which include or are connected to inverters. Those need to be EM compatible with all the other electronic devices that are already on the same roof, sometimes less than a metre away. In the 1970s, we often needed to protect analogue terrestrial TV, while we now have a multitude of radio services on or underneath the roof that need to work without performance degradation.\nMany manufacturers see EMC as an extra cost and don’t want to finance the EMC redesign of an existing product, for instance, to ensure that new limits are met. This is why we see a huge reluctance in some industries to accept new work items that could result in lower emission limits in EMC standards. But we need to find a compromise, because our standards otherwise will no longer be used or referred to by regulators. We have not been able to publish any update of our most important standards in the last four years because they get voted down at final draft stage. This often happens because the groups that work on the standards take decisions based on majority rule instead of finding compromises. We lack representation from regulators and spectrum users in the working groups and maintenance teams, which can be due to financial reasons or because of a difference in attitude towards standardization. Some spectrum users simply expect the spectrum to be kept clean, because they pay license fees for using it, which is why they do not see any additional need to engage in EMC standardization."

        "abstract": "The new IEC standard covers the performance metrics for dual-energy imaging capable x-ray devices. Learn more on how the standard plays a role in boosting improved diagnosis through medical imaging.",
        "content": "X-ray technologies have always been vital to new explorations in imaging techniques.\nEven back when Roentgen discovered them in 1895, X-rays had quickly become all the rage so much so that independent studios started popping up to take ‘bone portraits’.  Within a year, the medical community had also recognized the huge potential of the discovery.  Already by early 1896, doctors had started using it to image bone fractures and even performed the first angiography to check blood vessels.\nIn the realm of modern medical imaging, strides in X-ray technologies continue to push the boundaries of what's possible. However, today the world is more aware about the safety issues and more demanding of the quality of X-ray devices and technologies.\nBe it research facilities, hospitals or medical supplier companies, all are constantly looking to improve the performance of their device.\nBy issuing international standards around the functioning and performance of such devices, IEC is playing a pivotal role in enhancing medical imaging for improved diagnoses and patient care.\nNew standard for specific x-ray imaging devices\nThe new international standard IEC 62220-2-1:2023 offers insights around the performance of digital x-ray imaging devices meant for medical applications. Within the area, the scope of the standard specifically looks into devices capable of dual-energy imaging.\nDevices capable of dual-energy imaging are engineered to capture images using two different X-ray energy levels, enabling a deeper analysis of tissues and structures within the human body.\nThe standard specifies the performance metrics associated with such devices.\nWhy are performance metrics important?\nAt the heart of this standard, are the performance metrics that define the effectiveness of these cutting-edge devices. These metrics serve as the yardstick for assessing various aspects of imaging quality and functionality. The standard outlines methods for determining these metrics, which encompass:\n\n\nDose Performance: Relates to monitoring the safe amount of radiation exposure a patient receives during the imaging process. The standard provides a framework to include dose performance as part of the metrics needed to ascertain if the device is up to the mark. This ultimately helps ensure that patient dose is at safe levels.\n\n\nNoise Characteristics: Noise in images can obscure crucial details, leading to misinterpretations. The standard defines methods for analyzing and quantifying noise characteristics, thereby contributing to clearer and more accurate images.\n\n\nTissue-Subtraction Efficacy: One of the remarkable capabilities of these devices is the ability to subtract unwanted information from the images, leaving behind only the essential details. This is particularly useful in highlighting specific tissues or structures. The standard specifies how to assess the efficacy of this tissue-subtraction process.\n\n\nWho can benefit from the standard?\nThis standard is a roadmap for manufacturers and well-equipped test laboratories. It sets the stage for producing high-quality digital X-ray imaging devices to adhere to stringent performance standards. Whether it's a single exposure or multiple exposure dual-energy radiographic imaging, this document lays the foundation for excellence in medical imaging, and ultimately ensuring improved patient care.\nIEC TC SC 62B, responsible for this standard, also prepares other international standards and publications to support safety and performance for all kind of medical diagnostic imaging equipment, software and systems as well as quality procedures. Additionally, radiotherapy and nuclear imaging for diagnostic purposes are covered by SC 62C."

        "content": "The final webinar in the series of the IEC Academy panel sessions on Africa was an opportunity to find out more how IEC Conformity Assessment Systems can affect the African Continent and how Africa can, in turn, affect the systems themselves.\nTo underline the importance of the African continent for the IEC, the organization’s President, Jo Cops, kicked off the session by pointing out how IEC CA Systems were key tools that can be used to help African countries build a quality infrastructure, for instance when it comes to electricity access and renewable energy systems. “The IEC in Africa series was devised to invite the IEC global community to find and develop insights on the realities, challenges and opportunities relating to electricity and electrotechnology on the African continent. I hope that some of these insights will help you during your deliberations at the IEC General Meeting, which is being hosted in Africa for the third time and for the first time in Cairo, a city which combines both modernity and history,” he added.\nDavid Hanlon, the Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) Secretary at the IEC, started off the panel by explaining how CA Systems were an integral part of the IEC global offering. “IEC Standards and CA Systems are like two sides of a coin. Neither side has value without the other. They both create value together,” he explained. He introduced the four different CA systems, which operate in different market sectors.\nWhat are the different IEC CA Systems?\nThe most recent is IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, which is the internationally accepted CA system for all power plants producing, storing or converting energy from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind and various forms of marine energy.\nIECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components is “probably the best-known IEC CA System and it conducts activities on all the electrical and electronic products we use every day, for instance lights, electric switches, cables, kitchen electrical appliances, electric cars, medical equipment and much more,” said David Hanlon.\nIECEx is the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres. “Explosive places include mines, offshore oil rigs, gas refineries, petrol stations, airports and medical operating theatres,” he described.\nFinally, IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System, is “essentially a business-to-business CA System which provides supply chain certification,” according to David Hanlon.\nIECEx and IECQ Executive Secretary, Chris Agius, went on to explain that the demand from the marketplace was to have a standardized way of assessing and certifying products, parts and services which gave birth to the IEC CA Systems. The IECEx CA System was created in 1992 to test Ex equipment and IEC developed a full EX certification system, with online certificates. The system evolved to also offer certification services for overhaul and repair services, as well as maintenance, which is the IECEx services scheme. “At the request of industry, we went one step further and adopted a global approach to assessing the competence of personnel,” Chris Agius explained. He reminded everyone that the IEC did not offer these services itself but certified and accredited test labs to do so. “In IECEx, we have 100 labs which are certified to provide these services,” he added.\nEco-design and carbon footprint verification\nHe also announced the June kick off of the new IECQ quality assessment system for eco-design, according to IEC 62430, and the even more recent scheme relating to carbon footprint claim verification. “We hear in so many different instances companies claiming they have such and such a carbon footprint and that they have improved their carbon footprint without being able to verify those claims. I am very pleased to announce that IECQ will enable us to verify whether these claims stand up. We are currently evaluating test labs and bodies to be able to provide that service,” he said.\nHow can IEC CA Systems help Africa?\nWolfram Zeitz, executive Secretary for both IECRE and IECEE, reminded the audience that one of the key issues for Africa is sustainable development and at the heart of sustainable development lies sufficient availability of sustainable energy. “In order to make sure sustainable energy is provided safely and meets certain quality requirements, you need a conformity assessment system like IECRE,” he said.\nHe mentioned that IECEE addressed 23 different product categories, including solar PV parts and modules, hence its relevance for the import and installation of solar PV products in Africa.\n“There is a strong requirement for a quality infrastructure for renewable energy installations in Africa and African countries, without becoming members of the IEC CA Systems themselves, can support, acknowledge, and recognize the IECRE or IECEE CA certificates,” he added. Moreover, by becoming members of the CA Systems, Wolfram Zeitz emphasized that countries could go a step further by influencing rules and procedures, shaping them and making them more suited to each country’s individual needs.\nWhile some African countries are already members of IECEE, he encouraged them to also join IECRE, as renewable energy is becoming such a crucial issue on the continent. “By being members, they can a create a framework for the import and installation of renewable energy products which enables them to control the infrastructure. It would also enable IECRE to better identify the specific needs of the African continent.”\nOne of the issues identified was the lack of technical capacity and testing labs on the African continent, as these are expensive to install. Another issue, mentioned by François Ahoti, the IEC Regional Director for Africa, is the risk for Africa to become a dumping ground for lesser quality electronic products, which IEC CA Systems can prevent. “For instance, very few household appliances coming to Africa have been certified by IEC CA systems and that increases the risk of them being substandard and not lasting for long, which in turn means increased poverty and more e-waste for Africa, as they have to be replaced.”\nIn his view, Africa can benefit more than any other area of the world from the different IEC CA systems. ”Countries can start using the services on a voluntary basis, without becoming members like Senegal has, for instance. Other countries have already become members of IECEE, like Kenya, South Africa, The Ivory Coast or Nigeria,” he said.\nDavid Hanlon agreed: “Africa imports many of its electro-technical goods and by insisting that these goods are certified by IEC accredited test labs as meeting IEC CA Systems requirements, African countries avoid becoming a dumping ground for cheaper and lesser quality electronic goods. IEC certified products are more expensive initially. Other goods are cheaper but are less reliable and in the long run more expensive as they need to be replaced much more often. It is often a case of bad products being replaced by more bad products and that vicious circle needs to be broken.”\nHow some African countries use the IEC CA Systems\nThe Kenyan Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has become a recognizing National Certification Body (NCB) of IECEE. As a recognizing NCB, KEBS operates a national certification approval scheme which recognizes IECEE test reports and certificates for electrical and electronic components, equipment and products. Irene Njine, the Assistant Manager-Quality Assurance at KEBS, explains: “We have reaped several benefits from becoming a recognizing body. One of them is that when products have already been tested by IECEE-recognized labs, there is no need for KEBS to do further testing. The phrase one standard, one test, one certificate accepted everywhere, might be a slogan but it really applies here in Kenya. It also simplifies the clearance process for imported goods and saves time to market. We already recognize 200 electrotechnical goods and products and we are looking to expand that number.”\nSenegal is also using IEC CA Systems but in a different way.  “Not all countries have the infrastructure to control the quality of the products in Africa as it is too expensive. But IEC CA Systems offer the mutual recognition of conformity assessment certificates and associated test reports which work in these situations. In Senegal, since 2021 we have a quality control scheme for solar products and which is based on the authentication of existing CA certificates. We use the IEC online certificate database. The Senegalese government has since exempted certified solar products from VAT. The success of this quality control scheme will also lead to having a similar system for energy saving lamps,” describes Hassan Mbengue, the conformity assessment programme manager at the Senegalese Association for Standardization (ASN). The plan is for Senegal, which is currently an IEC affiliate country, to become an associate member of the IEC and a member of IECEE in the near future."

        "content": "Medical 3D printing is a fast growing and rapidly evolving sector, used in a wide range of areas from medical devices to surgery and personalized medicine. But few guidelines exist that can facilitate the sharing of data and processes that allow it to reach its potential even more. A new international standard has just been published to help.\nBefore the introduction of medical 3D printing, models needed to be made by hand in order to distinguish tissue parts. Not only was this time consuming and unhelpful in urgent situations, it made it tricky to use data from other medical staff.\nNow the global market value of 3D printing in the healthcare sector is estimated to reach nearly US$20 billion in 2032. Widely used in developing medical devices such as in orthopedics, it enables personalized designs and faster, cheaper prototyping and production. It was also used to help manufacture personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic to help meet the increase in demand.\nBut that’s not all. By allowing the creation of patient-specific anatomical models, 3D printing has helped to improve outcomes in diagnosis and surgery, is used in education and there’s even talk it could one day fabricate human organs.\nProfessor Kyu Won Shim, acting convenor of the working group for 3D printing and scanning in the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee on ICT said the technology allows for very complex designs and is therefore not without its challenges.\n“The right software is needed to be able to accurately and consistently visualize human anatomy, yet there are few guidelines and little guidance at an international level specifically for 3D printing technology,” he said.\n“This standard provides standardized procedures and methods for medical 3D printing modeling software, which will be extremely helpful in domestic and overseas medical 3D printing software licensing.”\nThe newly published standard, ISO/IEC 3532-1 Medical image-based modelling for 3D printing - Part 1: General requirements aims to resolve that issue by specifying the requirements for medical image-based modelling for 3D printing for medical applications.\nIt covers aspects such as the process flow, and data processing requirements such as 3D reconstruction and visualization, calibration and validation of 3D and 3D conversion and file format.\nWidespread use of the standard will help the technology to flourish, through recommending best practices and harmonizing language around the technology."

        "content": "In less than a year the torch will be lit at the Olympic Games in Paris with record breaking audiences expected to watch the competitions online. The International Olympic Committee’s broadcast services arm, OBS (Olympic Broadcasting Services) has been experimenting with new digital technologies, including AI.\nWith broadcasters reluctant to invest further in the (satellite or internet bandwidth) infrastructure needed to lift picture quality to 4K ultra high definition (UHD) resolution, attention has turned to using innovations in data and AI to bring the sport closer to home.\nData from the Olympics venues will be used on screen to inform and engage fans and behind the scenes to speed up content production. Trialled at Tokyo and again at the Winter Olympiad in Beijing, the IOC will expand the use of specialized algorithms applied to data during the French-based games. Read the full article in e-tech.\nTagging footage using AI\nThis includes an automatic media description system which combines existing data from the TV signal with image recognition based on an athlete’s bib. This will be used to make the process of tagging footage for use in media production much more efficient.\n“If we were to tag all our content, it would require an incredible effort and a large number of human operators,” explained OBS Chief Technology Officer, Sotiris Salamouris. “By using trained AI systems, this could be accomplished in a fraction of the time (and cost), while increasing both the speed of searches and the accuracy of the search response.”\nThe same system can be used to customize content for broadcasters, or even for individual fans, wanting to view the action of a particular country or athlete. AI-based motion tracking technology will help commentators and viewers keep track of the position of the athletes during events like marathon, road cycling, triathlon and canoe sprint. \nSport climbing returns after making its Olympic debut in Tokyo and to help audiences understand the challenges involved, OBS will use augmented reality technology to overlay live shots of the wall with virtual ones to display information about the holds, angles and routes.\nAI standards are essential\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 is the joint IEC and ISO committee that develops international standards for AI. The committee works on horizontal standards that provide a foundation for developing AI solutions across a wide and diverse set of industries and applications. For example, ISO/IEC 23894 shows users how to manage AI-related risks effectively in order to achieve objectives and improve performance.\nIEC TC 110 prepares standards relating to VR viewing, including VR, AR and MR eyewear displays, for instance IEC 63145-1-2. The IEC and ISO have formed a joint subcommittee, SC 24, which works on the standardization of interfaces for information technology based applications relating to computer graphics and virtual reality."

The scheme provides independent verification that companies use the correct process, methodology and registers to calculate the carbon footprint of a given product.\nIn addition, he discussed the important role that standards and CA play in the safe and effective development of transformational new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies.\nThis includes the standardization work in the joint ISO and IEC committee for AI, SC 42, which develops standards to enable interoperability, trust and transparency, and safety and security, while addressing societal concerns.\nIEC is embracing new technologies to develop SMART standards, which will be machine readable, as well as machine interpretable, executable and updatable, allowing users to interact with standards in a more effective and customized way.\nMr Metzger emphasized the importance of collaborating with a wide range of partners and stakeholders, both across and beyond the standardization community.\n“The challenges our world faces are too significant and too complex for any one organization to solve on its own. Collaboration will be key,” he said."

        "content": "Be it football, ice hockey or even a marathon, performance tracking and analysis play a significant role in sports nowadays. Coaches and teams use metrics to monitor the performance of players and train their strengths. Such analyses can also heavily influence decision making in team selections, play strategy or even alerts for medical interventions.\nFor effective monitoring though, one needs effective sensors, which is something IECQ, the Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, has been helping with. Read the full article in e-tech.\nEnsuring quality sensors with IEC International Standards\nThe global sports analytics market is valued at around USD 3,78 billion for 2023 and investors’ interest in the sports tech market is on a steady rise.\nAt the heart of this hyperquantification of sports lie sensors. Data capture is required to feed the different analysis tools for which high-grade and reliable sensors are needed.\nDifferent sensors also  require to be adapted to various needs – sensors may need to be protected against water: they can be affected by rainy weather or by sweat when stitched into players’ jerseys.\nThe IEC, through its technical committees, develops a huge number of international standards, which ensure that these sensors can operate efficiently and reliably. For instance, IEC TC 47 prepares international standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of sensors and IEC TC 86 publishes specifications for fibre-optic sensors. IEC TC 124 prepares standards for wearable electronic devices and technologies.\nReliance on IECQ testing and certification schemes\nIECQ further enables the assessment of sensor manufacturers and associated service providers to see if they comply with the agreed international standards.  \nSensors are just a small part of the broad scope for IECQ certificates, which are used worldwide as a tool to monitor and control the manufacturing supply chain, thus helping to reduce costs and time to market, and eliminating the need for multiple re-assessments of electronics suppliers. \nIECQ, established initially for electronic components, now also offers a ‘“green portfolio” combining three of its services. Together, they aim to promote responsible practices and provide transparency in terms of hazardous substance management, environmental impact reduction through eco design, and accurate carbon footprint reporting. The portfolio consists of the IECQ hazardous substance process management (HSPM) scheme, the eco design scheme and the carbon footprint claim verification.\nAs sports continue to embrace the power of data, adherence to IEC International Standards and the use of tools like IECQ testing and certification offer not only a competitive advantage to sensor manufacturers, but also a firm sense of quality in the performance-analysis industry.\nFor more information: The crucial role of quality sensors in performance analysis"

        "content": "Exoskeletons, 3D printing and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are helping athletes to enhance their performance, whether able bodied or not. Most of these technologies require international standards and conformity assessment systems to enable them to work safely and efficiently. A new ISO/IEC subcommittee, SC 43, has been recently been set up to standardize BCIs. Read the full article in e-tech.\nExoskeletons everywhere\nExoskeletons are making a buzz, with several devices hoping to hit consumer markets soon. A journalist at Wired recently tried out the Sportsmate 5, created by a Hong Kong and Shenzhen-based company. The enterprise hopes that Sportsmate 5 will become the first consumer exoskeleton ever. Until now, exoskeletons have been in the news mostly because they have helped people with spinal injuries to walk in a medical research context.\nThe Sportsmate 5 claims to help people run faster or for longer without getting too tired. It’s a plastic girdle fitted with two small motors, or actuators, which sit on the wearer’s hip joints. The actuators, powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery placed at the back of the belt, control two segmented metal rods, which in turn are clasped to a pair of fabric leg straps, to be wound around the thighs.\nWheelchair technology has also progressed in leaps and bounds, especially when used for competitive sporting competitions. Frame materials such as aluminium, titanium, and composite materials have been gradually introduced in the designs of sports wheelchairs to make them lighter and stiffer but ultimately faster and more responsive. Carbon fibre technology is likely to be the next step, but at this stage cost remains a barrier.\n3D printing is a major breakthrough, helping chairs and prosthetic limbs to be produced at a lesser cost – an important development for people with disabilities living in developing or emerging nations, where these essential devices are too costly for the average user.\nBrain-computer interfaces come into play\nWhile Sportsmate is used to enhance able-bodied performances, other similar cyborg-related devices have been devised to help people with disabilities perform in sport. As some of you may remember, the start of the 2014 Football World Cup was literally kicked off by Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old paraplegic athlete from Brazil wearing an exoskeleton developed by scientists from the Walk Again Project, a non-profit collaborative undertaking involving US, Swiss, Brazilian and German scientists. The free project aimed to allow people with disabilities to walk again by employing the latest technology developments, including virtual reality. The World Cup exoskeleton was powered by the athlete’s brain. He was wearing a cap which picked up brain signals and transmitted them to a computer in the exoskeleton’s backpack. Here they were decoded and sent to the exoskeleton’s legs.\nIEC Standards help technologies to become mainstream\nA plethora of IEC Standards published by a variety of technical committees are used to make these technologies safe and efficient, help their market adoption and ultimately bring their cost down. Lithium-ion cells are standardized by IEC TC 21, which publishes the IEC 62660 series on secondary lithium-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four CA systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances, etc., of batteries, chargers and charging stations.\nMost of the electric motors powering exoskeletons are standardized by IEC TC 2: Rotating machinery. The TC publishes the IEC 60034 series of international standards which ranks electric motors according to their energy efficiency. Regulators, the world over, have taken this classification system on board and made it an intrinsic part of their policies.\nIECEE runs several energy efficiency testing programmes, notably the IECEE Global Motor Energy Efficiency Programme (GMEEP). The programme tests motors in relation to the IEC 60034-2-1 Standard, which specifies the energy efficiency requirements for motors.\nIEC TC 113: Nanotechnology for electrotechnical products and systems, publishes the IEC 62607 series of technical specifications, which establish safety requirements and testing procedures for carbon nanotube materials.\nISO/IEC TC 28 works on the standardization of some of the features and the testing of 3D scanners and printers."

        "content": "Christian Gabriel, the head of standardization at the Austrian Association for Electrical Engineering (OVE), has passed away unexpectedly at the age of 57. Mr Gabriel’s contributions to electrotechnical standardization earned him both national and international recognition.\nMr Gabriel began his career as a sales engineer in the field of sensor technology before joining the standardization department at OVE in 1996. In 2004, he assumed the role of head of OVE Standardization and became Executive Secretary of the IEC National Committee of Austria, where his leadership skills and passion for collaboration shone brightly.\nMr Gabriel played a pivotal role in representing Austrian interests in electrotechnical standardization on the global stage. He was an elected member of the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) and was highly active in numerous other roles and activities within IEC.\nThis includes being the Chair of the Standardization Programme Coordination Group, a member of the Finance Committee and various roles in the Directives Maintenance Team (DMT). In addition, he was a passionate supporter of the IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme and personally involved in Austria’s mentoring partnership with Zambia.\nHe made a significant contribution to the strength of the organization, enhancing collaboration with other standardization bodies and ensuring international standardization contributes to a better world.\nJo Cops, President of the IEC, expressed the profound loss felt by the electrotechnical community: \"Christian Gabriel's sudden passing has left us deeply shocked and saddened. His expertise and dedication were not only evident in his leadership but also in his role as a mentor to the next generation of standardization experts.”\nVimal Mahendru, Chair of the SMB and IEC Vice President, said the board was devastated at the news. “He was a valued member of the SMB, with an extremely high level of integrity and professionalism. He was a strong pillar of global standardization, and committed to strike consensus while always respecting differing opinions. What’s more, he was warm, highly sociable, and a friend to the entire community.  I will sorely miss his presence, wisdom and humour on the board.  He will be fondly remembered as the gentle giant.”\nPhilippe Metzger, Secretary-General and CEO of the IEC, echoed their sentiments. “Christian’s unexpected departure leaves a void that will be deeply felt. He will be remembered not only for his strong and impactful engagement in IEC work but also for his candid contributions and great sense of humour. While his height made him stand out in crowded events like the IEC General Meeting, it was his welcoming personality that made him a friend to many”.\nOVE Secretary General Peter Reichel was also saddened: “We have lost an experienced manager and extremely popular colleague in the OVE. Christian's death leaves a big void not only professionally, but also personally. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.”\nBorn in Upper Austria, Gabriel studied electrical engineering at Graz University of Technology, laying the foundation for a career that would be marked by excellence. He is survived by his wife and three adult sons.\nAs the world of electrotechnical standardization mourns his passing, Mr Gabriel's legacy will continue to inspire generations of professionals in their pursuit of excellence and innovation."

        "content": "Biometrics has been around for centuries in the form of fingerprinting, but with advances in technology, its use and applications have exploded everywhere.\nBiometrics are measurements of human characteristics used to identify individuals in a reliable and non-invasive way. Methods include fingerprinting, facial recognition, palm prints, ear shapes and behavioural characteristics such as keystroke when typing and gait. \nBanking applications, mobile phones, passports and entry to buildings are just some of the areas where biometric technology is used to authenticate individuals, and its usage is growing exponentially. Currently 171 countries in the world use biometric passports, and increasing innovation in biometric technology means adoption of biometrics is expected to more than triple by 2028.\nOne of the main reasons it is so widely used is because, with markers unique to individuals, it is a reliable and highly accurate method of identification and authentication.\nHowever, where technology grows, cyber criminals flow. One method used is the impersonation of biometric markers, such as fingerprints and facial characteristics to break into systems in what is known as ‘presentation attacks’. Mechanisms for the automated detection of presentation attacks are known as presentation attack detection (PAD).\nThe ISO/IEC 30107 series of standards provides guidelines and recommendations for PADs. ISO/IEC 30107-1 provides a framework through which presentation attack events can be documented and analysed to enhance decision making.\nIt has recently been updated to align with other standards in the series and ensure it is up-to-date with industry developments.\nOther standards in the series include ISO/IEC 30107-2 which defines data formats for conveying the mechanism used as well as results of biometric PAD; ISO/IEC 30107-3 for testing and reporting and ISO/IEC 30107-4 for PAD testing of mobile devices.\nThe joint ISO and IEC committee for biometrics standards, SC 37, has developed over 130 international standards, with many more in development, to support interoperability and data interchange among applications and systems.\nIn addition, the committee closely monitors factors influencing biometric technologies such as cyber security and ethical or cross jurisdictional and societal aspects."

        "abstract": "The newly published international standard, ISO/IEC 24029-2 focuses on formal assessment methods for gauging the robustness of neural networks.",
        "content": "A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. Neural network technology is found in a wide range of applications that are shaping the way we interact with the world, from voice assistants like Alexa or Siri to self-driving vehicles and personalized recommendation systems.  \nNeural networks consist of interconnected nodes, also known as artificial neurons or units, organized in layers. Each neuron takes input, processes it using a specific weight and bias and produces an output that is fed forward to the next layer. \nNeural networks learn from data through a process called training, where they adjust their weights and biases to make better predictions or decisions over time. They have become an essential part of modern AI systems due to their ability to process unstructured data (like images or sounds), identify patterns and make predictions. \nThey have achieved remarkable success in various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition and more. As AI technology integrates deeper into our lives, however, there is a growing concern for its trustworthiness. This concern comes from two factors intrinsic to neural networks: the difficulty to explain their output and the difficulty to predict their behaviour everywhere in their domain of use.\nCan we rely on AI systems to make accurate decisions, especially when unforeseen circumstances arise? In critical areas such as healthcare, finance and self-driving vehicles, AI errors can have an important impact on the trustworthiness of the system and in return its acceptability by the public or the industry.\nThe joint IEC and ISO Committee on AI, SC 42, is developing the ISO/IEC 24029 series to address these concerns. \n“By powering deeper learning, neural network-based AI systems can enable a plethora of new societally beneficial applications that would otherwise not be possible,” said Wael William Diab, Chair of the joint IEC and ISO committee on AI. “The ISO/IEC 24029 series on neural networks was developed with the same holistic ecosystem-based approach that addresses ethical concerns as well emerging technology requirements simultaneously to enable responsible adoption.” \nRobustness is the ability of an AI system to maintain its level of performance under any conditions. The technical report (TR), ISO/IEC TR 24029-1, published in 2021, highlights three types of method that can be used to assess the robustness of neural networks:\n\nFormal methods rely on sound formal proofs to check if certain properties are provable over a specific domain of use. For example, evaluators can assess whether the system always operates within specified safety boundaries;\nStatistical approaches involve mathematical testing on datasets to determine a certain level of confidence in the results. They help evaluators answer questions related to performance thresholds, such as false positive/negative rates, and whether they are acceptable;\nEmpirical methods: These methods involve experimentation, observation, and expert judgment to assess the system's behaviour in specific scenarios. Evaluators can determine the degree to which the system's properties hold true in real-life situations.\n\n\nThe newly published international standard, ISO/IEC 24029-2 focuses on formal assessment methods for gauging the robustness of neural networks. \n“The standard offers a theoretical foundation combined with practical methodologies to ensure AI systems can withstand real-world challenges, even outside controlled environments,” said David Filip, convenor of the working group that developed ISO/IEC 24029-2.\n“The new ISO/IEC standard provides essential guidelines on assessing the robustness of neural networks under different constraints and conditions by providing evaluators with a set of specific requirements, recommendations and techniques,” said Arnault Ioualalen, ISO/IEC 24029-2 project leader.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns. \nSC 42 organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is free to attend. Topics covered include, among others, AI applications, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements."

        "content": "BioDigital convergence is a field that brings together expertise from two wide streams, setting the stage for innovative scientific exploration and engineering. As technological advancements in this field gains momentum, it becomes imperative for standards around the area to co-evolve in order to ensure efficient progress.\nAt the IEC, experts from several international organizations, disciplines and sectors are working together in the Standardization Evaluation Group (SEG) 12 to identify critical challenges and contribute to a roadmap for future standardization in the area.\nTaking a systems approach\nBut how does one approach such a large area? According to IEC expert François Coallier, chair of SEG 12 who has been in the standards industry for nearly 40 years now, “Never start with a blank page”. A systematic and structured  initial research helps save valuable time as usually there’s a lot of work to be done.\nProfessor Coallier studied biology initially after which he went on to become an engineer. Working on BioDigital convergence, he was able to come back to his first love of biology and put his extensive professional and standardisation experience to use.\nBeing the chair, he stresses the importance of a systems approach: having a holistic view, being structured and systematic, and thinking in terms of collaborative and multidisciplinary work. Separate Working Groups (WGs) within SEG 12 have been looking into different areas such as BioDigital standardization opportunities for genomics, neuroscience, biosensors, drug discovery, artificial organs or even human augmentation like brain-machine interfaces, continual monitoring, enhanced strength, biohacking. SEG 12 is also carrying out important work on terminology, which will help to facilitate the exchange of information and to serve as a basis for future standardization activities.\nSynergies in innovation\nThere are many synergies between the different WGs and with other technical committees (TC) and sub-committees (SC); experts work in close cooperation.\nProfessor Coallier himself is also the chair of subcommittees formed by IEC and ISO to standardize the Internet of Things and Digital Twin (SC 41). He gives one example,\n“Through our work in SC 41, we have also published several standards on the topic of underwater sensors, like ISO/IEC 30142-2 and as ISO/IEC 30171-1, which standardize underwater acoustic sensor networks. While these sensors are used in many industrial applications like detecting underwater pipe leakages, it can also be employed for environmental monitoring, which fall under SEG 12’s scope.”\nSynergies between work, mean that there is overlap between experts and stakeholders as well. Often in meetings across different countries and regions, speaking to people brings common interests and inventive approaches to light.   With rapid developments in the area, working in cohesion with similar industries also help identify key needs for development.\n“It’s a balance”, says Professor Coallier, “In some context, standardizing too soon may stifle innovation, while in others being early will enable markets and thus boost healthy competition and consequently innovation.”\nThe ethical argument\nA dedicated WG in SEG 12 contemplates issues of environmental concerns, sustainability, social risks, and ethical aspects related to BioDigital convergence.\nRecently the field of BioDigital convergence has seen breakthroughs in bioengineering, biomedical devices, molecular farming, artificial organs, stem cell research and environmental monitoring which can help tackle many global challenges.\nHowever, in such matters of biological, people are quick to spring the question of risks and ethics. A side we sometimes forget is that ethically speaking, researchers also have a certain degree of responsibility to keep pursuing new research and pushing the frontiers of science that can address many of humanity’s challenges such as global hunger, health, and sustainability.\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\nA chart showing how the various different areas of BioDigital Convergence help solve global challenges by contributing to different UN Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe path ahead\nThe journey doesn’t end with SEG 12 though. After François Coallier and his team wrap up their final report, the work done by SEG 12 may set the basis for a future Systems committee to facilitate standardization in the area of BioDigital convergence.\nThe extensive work by standardization experts in this field contributes to ensuring the quality and safety of continued technological innovation."

        "content": "Imposters and burglars have been around as long as humans, but these days it is the silent, digital kind that is causing most of the havoc. With the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices worldwide expected to explode from 15.1 billion in 2020 to over 29 billion by 2030, protecting against cyber attacks and unwanted intrusions into networks is an ongoing battle.\nSecurity protocols such as SSL (secure sockets layer) and TLS (transport layer security) are important for protecting confidentiality and the integrity of data, but it’s not enough. Connected devices need to be able to distinguish reliable sources of input from false or malicious ones, every single time.\nTo ensure trustworthy connections, several elements need to be addressed. These include:\n\n\nhardware security modules (HSM) to establish the reliable root of trust\n\n\nthe identity of devices and services comes from trusted parties\n\n\nthe establishment of mutual authentication between devices and services, so there is a secure channel, and\n\n\ndata identity to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data over the long term\n\n\nISO/IEC 27071, Security recommendations for establishing trusted connections between devices and services aims to help organizations set up HSM in PCs and mobile or IoT devices.\nIt provides a framework for establishing a trusted connection, covering key elements such as the HSM, root of trust, data identity and authenticity, as well as security recommendations for each of these areas. It also provides an example of establishing a trusted connection and solutions for components of a trusted connection.\nIn addition, it features a wide range of examples of different types of threats and offers possible solutions. This includes threats from a user’s perspective as well as threats against the device, service and security channels.\nFor example, fictional data generated by AI could find its way into systems and be used unknowingly, or an attacker could modify the code running in the device, enabling them to get access to confidential data.\nOther examples include phishing attacks against the security channels, using forged or compromised certificates, or where the device is impersonated and the attacker is able to interact with the service.\nISO/IEC 27071 is the work of the joint ISO and IEC technical committee SC 27.\nSC 27 is responsible for developing international management and technical standards for protecting information communication technology (ICT). This includes generic methods, techniques and guidelines to address both security and privacy aspects, including identity management, cryptographic mechanisms and conformance assessment, accreditation and auditing requirements."

        "abstract": "AI tools like ChatGPT have become public favourites but are they competent enough to solve deeper questions?",
        "content": "The rapid development and widespread availability of artificial intelligence (AI) tools have had a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, from suggesting good restaurants to generating striking images for projects. Of course, machine-learning algorithms and AI methodologies can also be invaluable in the hands of researchers trying to develop solutions to global issues, such as improving education healthcare, safety, sanitation and more.\nOne study, published in the European Journal of Human Genetics tried to answer the question, ‘Can ChatGPT  understand genetics?’\nIn this particular study, the researchers looked at the first version of ChatGPT released in November 2022. ChatGPT has large amounts of texts from various sources on almost all topics, fed to it as training datasets, based on which it can learn to give an intelligent or at least an intelligent-sounding answer. Within these large corpora of text, it also has access to publications of biomedical, medical and clinical research on genetics and genomics. So, the researchers wanted to see if it could be reliable enough to answer questions on the topic.\nThe experiment found that it could do so with an accuracy of 70 %. However, what about the 30%?\nThis is exactly what was pointed out by François Coallier, who chairs the IEC Standards Evaluation Group SEG 12 which is looking into bio-digital convergence.\nProfessor Coallier explained that while the role of AI is crucial to propelling innovations across fields, the scope of programmes like ChatGPT are currently limited. These are Generative Pre-trained Transformers, meaning their learning model can make use of only the information in training datasets to give back information to users.\nMore recent research has also identified a phenomenon called ‘drift’ where the performance or behaviour of a trained AI model changes over time in an unpredictable manner. Specifically, it refers to situations where the model's output gradually shifts away from its originally intended or desired behaviour, such as becoming poorer in maths.\nThus, the verification of analytic content being generated still needs fine-tuning.  For this reason, if you want to diagnose a genetic problem, asking ChatGPT is not the best solution. \nWhile ChatGPT can give genetic answers with 70% accuracy, it is a product of the information fed into its system; it cannot be called a reliable tool to competently analyse all genetic data. However, other machine learning models can play an important role in genetic and genomic analysis.\nWork done by standardization experts like Professor Coallier feeds into defining frameworks for technological exploration. For instance, there is a joint IEC and ISO committee, JTC 1/ SC 42, dedicated to developing standards for AI. Noteworthy is SC 42/ Working Group 3’s work on AI trustworthiness standards, like ISO/IEC TR 24027:2021 or ISO/IEC TR 24028:2020.\nThere is no doubt about the power of AI technologies, though. Thanks to the collective work of researchers, standards organizations and market stakeholders, AI has enormous potential to tackle global challenges.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee also organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available.\n \n \nRead more\nThe potential of synthetic data for healthcare"

        "content": "The convergence of digital technologies, cloud computing and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has transformed industrial processes. Nowadays, industrial Internet platforms (IIPs) play an essential role in orchestrating the collection, analysis and utilization of vast amounts of data from industrial machinery. \nIIPs are being used in manufacturing, for example, to improve quality control, optimize production and reduce waste. The energy sector is leveraging IIPs to improve grid efficiency, reduce outages and monitor environmental impact. \nIn the transport industry, IIPs are being used to improve safety, optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. The gains come at a price, however, as increased connectivity creates a bigger attack surface for threat actors. \nIt is critically important to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data that IIPs collect and manage, including proprietary manufacturing information, customer data, financial records and operational details. It is equally essential to protect the devices that are connected to the IIP from unauthorized access, tampering, theft or destruction.\nAny breach or compromise could have disastrous consequences not only for the organization but also for public safety and the economy. A new ISO/IEC Standard addresses these challenges. \nISO/IEC 24392:2023 is tailor-made for the industrial landscape. It identifies and addresses threats arising from the integration of cyber-physical systems, IIoT devices and cloud technologies. \nISO/IEC 24392 provides guidance on appropriate security controls based on existing international standards, including ISO/IEC 27001 and parts of IEC 62443 and IEC 62351. It recommends a risk-based and threat-informed cybersecurity strategy that identifies and prioritizes the most critical assets, processes and data in the IIP and applies appropriate security measures to protect them.\nIt is a holistic and collaborative approach to cybersecurity that involves all the stakeholders in the IIP ecosystem. Implementing the standard instils trust by fostering a secure environment for manufacturers, suppliers and service providers to collaborate knowing that their data and operations are protected. \nThe standard is for organizations that develop, operate, or use any components of IIPs, including third parties who provide services to the relevant stakeholders. It provides recommendations for users on how to protect IIPs against IIP-specific threats.\nThe new standard is the work of the joint ISO and IEC technical committee SC 27. Dr Edward Humphreys (SC 27 Communications and Outreach Officer) says, “ISO/IEC 24392 represents a significant advancement in addressing the mitigation of cyber-risks for Industrial Internet Platforms.  Across all industries, there is an urgent need to stay ahead of the latest cyber-risks affecting IIPs and this standard is designed to assist those developing, implementing and operating IIPs with effective cyber-security solutions and defences”.\nSC 27 is responsible for developing international management and technical standards for information security and privacy protection and related topics. The committee's scope includes developing standards for the security and privacy protection of systems, information technologies, processes and services."

        "content": "Data is the foundation on which artificial intelligence (AI) models are built. Not only do AI models learn from data, but also the quality and quantity of data that is available will determine the accuracy and performance of the AI model. \nThat is why data lifecycle management (DLM) processes are vitally important.  They help organizations to protect their data from loss, damage and unauthorized access, as well as mitigating data risks, such as breaches, ransomware attacks and data corruption.\nDLM processes help to ensure data accuracy, completeness and protection against tampering or alteration. They can also facilitate compliance with data regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nDLM processes can enable organizations to make better decisions by providing them with access to accurate and timely data. They also help to improve operational efficiency by reducing the time and cost of managing data, as well as the need to store and manage unnecessary data. \nA new international standard provides an overarching data life cycle framework applicable to any AI system, from its conception to decommissioning. ISO/IEC 8183 aims to bring clarity, efficiency and reliability to the way organizations handle their data, ensuring they are aligned with industry best practices.  \n\"ISO/IEC 8183 provides a guideline for organising and managing the complexity of AI data life cycles”, said Colin Crone, the ISO/IEC 8183 project leader. “Its objective is to be practical, overarching and be applied to all AI processes, not just machine learning”.\nThe international standard will help to bolster system governance, data quality, data security and system utility by emphasizing the crucial role of data processing at every stage of the AI system life cycle. It can also help organizations to maximize the value of their data by making it more accessible, usable and secure.\n“This new international standard addresses one of the topmost challenges to the successful implementation of AI systems”, said the project convenor, David Boyd. “It shows users how to put concrete measures in place to eliminate problems related to issues like data silos, bad data, data compliance issues and inadequate data controls leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems”.\nISO/IEC 8183 describes a comprehensive framework that covers all aspects of data management, from data acquisition and creation to development, deployment, maintenance and eventual decommissioning. It is a flexible and adaptable structure that can be tailored to suit the diverse needs of different organizations. \nThe standard promotes a technology-agnostic approach to ensure that organizations have the freedom to implement the best-suited solutions.\nThe 10 stages outlined in ISO/IEC 8183 provide a clear roadmap for data processing within AI systems. From the early stages of ideation and defining business requirements to the crucial phases of data planning, acquisition and preparation, organizations are equipped to handle data responsibly and ethically. \nThe subsequent stages of building the model, deploying the system and operating it efficiently further ensure the robustness of AI systems. ISO/IEC 8183 also addresses the often-overlooked aspect of data decommissioning. \nISO/IEC 8183 completes the circle of responsible data management by emphasizing appropriate data handling at the end of an AI system's life cycle.\n“This standard complements the work of SC 42 and highlights the fundamental importance of the data ecosystem to AI”, said SC 42 Chair Wael William Diab. “It reflects our commitment to developing standards for the responsible use of data and beneficial AI”.\nSC 42 is the joint IEC and ISO committee that develops international standards for AI. It looks at both technology capability and non-technical requirements for the entire AI ecosystem, including business, regulatory and policy requirements, for example, as well as application domain needs and ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is free to attend. Topics covered include, among others, AI applications, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements. \nThe June workshop included a preview of ISO/IEC 8183.

The SEG 12 chair, François Coallier, has reached out to experts from other SDOs, industry, academia and international organizations to look into current research and technology activities, identify critical challenges and propose a possible roadmap for future standardization activities.\nWithin SEG 12 there is a dedicated working group dealing with ethical aspects related to bio-digital convergence. When deliberating over these ethical considerations, experts try to align their work around some key principles:\n\nSovereignty of life: Ensuring it is human-centric and respecting principles of democracy, autonomy, privacy, and knowledge (e.g., the right to awareness about dual use and impacts).\nHuman rights: Checking that developments don’t infringe upon someone’s freedom or that there is no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment; mitigating bias while also securing equality, fraternity and cooperation among people and countries, and human dignity.\nSocial justice: Considering impact on trust and upholding fairness, transparency, accountability, as well as to ensure things like fair cost and taxation. Besides this, also assessing issues of accessibility, equitable justice and strong judicial institutions.\nProfessional ethical responsibility: Following the ‘do not harm’ principle (no lethal machines) and values such as autonomy, accountability, trust, security, equity, integrity, respect for stakeholder interest and international norms of behaviour.\nTo promote planet resilience capability: Evaluating adherence to sustainability, well-being, accountability, and respect for rule of law. Seeing that rights to knowledge are upheld, such as receiving information about solutions and impacts, and checking that innovation is done through harmony with people, animals and the environment.\n\nThese outlining principles are important safeguarding mechanisms. They are a reminder that ethical questions raised by many of these technologies are not only associated with their use, but also in the face of current global challenges like climate change, their non-use.\nThese ethical considerations help ensure that as innovations traverse through uncharted territories, they do not accidentally infringe upon the well-being of society.\n \nRead more\nNew ISO/IEC report offers guidance on the responsible adoption of AI"

Zebra stripes, blood vessel patterns in rodent ears, muzzle prints, bat wing patterns, primate facial recognition and koala spots have all been experimented with as methods of identification.\nBut in order to fully reap the benefits of biometrics and allow its development to flourish, there needs to be safeguards in place to reduce the risks of data misuse and improve overall trust.\nISO/IEC 24714, Biometrics – Cross-jurisdictional and societal aspects of biometrics – General guidance takes all of this, and more into account. It is based on the technical report ISO/IEC TR 24714-1:2008 and includes the addition of by design principles as well as use case examples.\nThe standard offers guidance on the design of systems that use biometric technologies, covering societal norms and legal requirements across various levels of jurisdictions, privacy and data protection of individuals, accessibility and usability and health and safety aspects.\nEditor of ISO/IEC 24714 Fred Preston said there are a vast array of aspects that designers and developers of biometrics systems need to take into account to ensure they are safe, accessible and fit for the intended purpose.\n“Privacy is one of the biggest and most complex issues confronting the biometrics industry, as while on one hand it demands less personal information such as addresses or family history, the data collected is more directly linked to the subject, and is so for life,” he said.\n“By considering all aspects of privacy, safety, local laws, societal expectations and accessibility, the likelihood of the technology being accepted and trusted ultimately improves.

        "abstract": "IEC Standards and conformity assessment ensure that the technologies used in vertical farming work safely and efficiently.",
        "content": "Vertical farming is a more sustainable food production system that uses less water, energy and land than traditional agriculture. IEC Standards and conformity assessment ensure that the technologies used in vertical farming work safely and efficiently.\nVertical farms are typically located in urban areas, where they can help to reduce food miles and improve food security. One of the biggest advantages of vertical farming is that it uses a fraction of the water that traditional agriculture does. \nThis is because most vertical farms use hydroponics, which is the process of growing plants in nutrient-enriched water with little or no soil. Hydroponics is much more efficient than traditional agriculture, which relies on rain and irrigation. \nVertical farms can maximize crop yields and reduce resource wastage by monitoring and managing elements such as light, humidity and temperature. Stacks of crops grow vertically, eliminating the need for the vast land areas typically required for traditional farming practices. \nProponents of vertical farming believe it can address pressing challenges associated with conventional agriculture, such as carbon-emitting transport, deforestation and over-reliance on chemical fertilizers. Vertical farming significantly reduces the environmental impact of transporting fresh produce by shifting production from rural areas to cities, where most people reside.\nLED lighting and sensor technologies play a crucial role in providing optimal growth conditions. Temperature, nutrient supply, humidity, oxygen levels, airflow and water management are carefully controlled. \nA network of sensors collects real-time data on plant health, growth and yield. Automated systems make real-time adjustments to plant care possible. This synergy between technology and agriculture offers increased efficiency and productivity. \nThe IEC develops international standards that underpin the technology utilized in vertical farming. For instance, IEC Technical Committee 34 develops international standards for lamps, electric light and lighting solutions. TC 47 develops standards for the design and use of semiconductors, including sensors.\nSeveral TCs prepare standards in the area of industrial automation. These include TC 65, which addresses process measurement, control and automation, TC 17, which develops standards for switchgear and controlgear and TC 22, which standardizes power electronic systems and equipment. \nTC 44 provides standards for the safety of machinery. The water used by vertical farms relies on pumps with motors that are standardized by IEC TC 2.\nPairing vertical farming with renewable energy is essential because it is more energy intensive than traditional agriculture. As they switch to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and marine power, they will be using standards developed by IEC TC 82 for solar photovoltaic energy systems, IEC TC 88 for wind energy generation systems and IEC TC 114 for marine energy.\nIn JTC 1, the joint IEC and ISO Technical Committee, SC 42 provides standardization in the area of AI, as well as guidance to other committees developing AI applications. SC 41 develops International Standards for the Internet of Things (IoT), making connectivity possible, while SC 38 addresses the standardization of cloud computing for the storage and retrieval of data.\nMeanwhile, IEC conformity assessment ensures that many of the standards used in vertical farming are correctly implemented. LED lights are a case in point. \nLighting systems rely on standards to ensure safety, performance and quality. With the mass production of LED lights, however, fears have emerged regarding their quality and reliability.\nOne faulty component can result in poor performance or even the overall failure of the LED lighting system. All electronic components, parts, modules and assemblies must work satisfactorily together.\nThe IEC has developed the IECQ scheme for LED that certifies manufacturers and suppliers of electronic components and assemblies used in the production of LED lighting systems.\nThis scheme provides manufacturers with the confidence that the products they sell or purchase have been independently verified and comply with the requirements of the relevant technical standards and specifications.\n\nVertical farming, supported by IEC Standards and conformity assessment, promises a more sustainable and efficient approach to urban agriculture. Vertical farming holds the potential to shape a future where cities become hubs of fresh produce, ensuring a resilient and nourished population."

        "abstract": "With hospitals and healthcare systems looking to hydrogen alternatives as a sustainable solution, IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems remain vital in ensuring a safe working environment.",
        "content": "Let’s go back in time to 2020 for a moment – to the underground parking lot of a hospital in the US city of Detroit. It was a Friday evening like any other, but something was not quite right. Suddenly a loud explosion filled the air and shards of glass went flying everywhere.\nA hydrogen tank in the back of a parked pickup truck had exploded. A 72-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man were seriously injured. Fortunately, there were no fatalities, but things could have been far worse.\nNowadays, we know that hydrogen-related incidents like this one can be quite common in places where safety measures have not been properly followed. As green hydrogen becomes a feasible and sustainable option for places like hospitals, standards organizations such as IEC are playing an increasingly significant role in addressing the health and safety concerns that come along with the use of the highly flammable gas.\nThe push for ‘green’ hospitals\nMany hospitals across the world have recently been considering going ‘green’ in the fight against climate change. Spain and Netherlands are among countries where hospitals have already started becoming functional using ‘green hydrogen’ for power generation.\nCarbon-neutral strategies adopted by different countries have been a driver for hospitals to devise decarbonization strategies. Green hydrogen generated through the process of electrolysis, powered by renewable energies such as wind or solar, presents a sustainable solution which can be produced without emitting enormous amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nHydrogen use in hospitals is not just limited to power generation though. Researchers are exploring its potential use in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.\nHow is IECEx helping hospitals become safe for hydrogen-use?\nIf the use of hydrogen becomes more prevalent medically, it will also mean that medical practitioners and operators handling the gas would need to be trained for it. \nBut how does one ensure that the training meets a certain standard of safety and quality? This is where standards and conformity assessment organizations like the IEC come into the picture. Experts from all around the world set safety, quality, and reliability standards.\nThey also have procedures to ensure that factories or other institutes and organizations conform to these international standards.\nIECEx is a conformity assessment system set up to deal with the testing and certification to IEC, ISO/IEC and ISO Standards relating to equipment for use in explosive atmospheres. IECEx brings its expertise to the hydrogen economy.\nWith more than 25 years of experience in testing and certifying electrical and non-electrical equipment, repair and overhaul facilities as well as personnel competence associated with use of equipment in explosive (Ex) atmospheres, which has always included areas where hydrogen may be present, it is well suited to extend its coverage to other elements associated with hydrogen, especially green hydrogen, and the hydrogen economy: ensuring the safety and security of equipment in and workers operating in a hydrogen environment.\nAs hospitals and other operations start transitioning to hydrogen alternatives, international standards and the IECEx System ensure a safe and sustainable future.  All IECEx certificates offer clear proof of compliance with international standards, an important assurance for anyone responsible for the safety of those working in such areas and for the equipment they operate.\n \nRead more\nMultiple uses of hydrogen in the medical field.\nHospitals go green in the fight against climate change."

She explains what key standards are in the pipeline and how they involve artificial intelligence (AI).\nWhich crucial standards will IEC TC 62 be working on in the coming months?\nMedical standards are written by around 20 technical committees which include IEC TC 62 and ISO/TC 210. The base standards for AI in the medical world are the standards for quality management and the risk management system, combined with usability and software development process standards. All these are published by different TCs which work together in the medical area, and which try to build a solid base for artificial intelligence developments. It is joint work. IEC TC 62 publishes several basic safety and performance standards, which are gradually having to incorporate AI. In the autumn, we expect to start the work on the fourth edition of one of the most fundamental IEC TC 62 Standards, IEC 60601-1, which specifies the general requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of medical devices. This fourth edition, developed in SC 62A, will include new concepts such as AI. Such a standard however cannot address every development related to AI for every device alone. It is meant to be a central reference point which will point you towards other standards for different medical devices. It will be referenced by at least one hundred device-specific standards. If we did not adopt such an approach, the standard would be over 1 500 pages long and exhausting to read. In parallel, SC 62A plans to start working on the new edition of IEC 62304, the base process standard for medical software. We will also be trying to establish a base architecture for medical AI standards in the new edition of this standard.\nAny projects specifically related to AI?\nWe have  set up a group which is dealing with the performance evaluation process of AI and machine learning-enabled medical devices. We also have a more advanced project group which is preparing IEC 63450 on the testing of AI and machine learning-enabled medical devices. In addition, SC 62B has adopted a new work item for AI-supported analysis of pulmonary images.\nRead the full interview in e-tech"

        "content": "International standards for Artificial Intelligence (AI) are valuable tools both for regulators and for the industry, as they are developed based on market needs and help to facilitate global trade, said the World Trade Organization’s Lauro Locks.\nMr Locks, legal counsellor on matters of the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) agreement at the WTO said the growth and diffusion of AI requires interoperability, which can be achieved with international standards.\nHe was speaking at a recent workshop on AI, led by the IEC and ISO joint-committee for AI, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 42.\n“Transformational digital technologies like AI are a challenge for regulators because the technology is constantly changing,” he said.\n“Yet one of the six principles of the TBT agreement is that standards have to be relevant and effective and respond to regulatory and market needs, as well as scientific and technological developments in various countries.\n“Standards are therefore highly relevant for regulations in the AI area.”\nThe WTO TBT Agreement, for which all WTO members are signatories, ‘aims to ensure that technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures are non-discriminatory and do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade…[and] strongly encourages members to base their measures on international standards as a means to facilitate trade.'\nIn his presentation Mr Locks added: “The TBT agreement promotes the balance between preserving sovereign rights of governments to regulate for safety and other important policies and limiting unnecessary barriers to trade. International standards are strongly encouraged to enable that balance”\nGovernments around the world are increasingly introducing policies and regulations to govern AI and other digital technologies yet they are still at early stages of development.\nThey also tend to be sector-specific, and their stringency varies from sector to sector. The Agreement strongly encourages members to use international standards as a means to facilitate trade because they harmonize the requirements across countries, reducing duplication and providing transparency.\nSC 42 has developed a number of standards for AI to both meet the needs of the market while facilitating the responsible deployment of AI technologies. These include foundational standards such as ISO/IEC 22989 which defines the terminology for AI and describes concepts, and ISO/IEC 23053 which establishes an AI and Machine Learning (ML) framework for describing a generic AI system using ML technology.\nBy providing consistent terminology and systems they provide a solid foundation from which AI applications can be developed.\nSC 42 is also developing a portfolio of standards to enable certification and thus quality control in AI.\nISO/IEC 42001 will provide a management system for AI that can be certified to, looking at the process by which an AI system is developed to ensure that many of the protocols to ensure responsible AI are followed.\nOthers in the portfolio will include ISO/IEC 42005 that will provide guidance on performing AI system impact assessments and ISO/IEC 42006 which will provide requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of AI management systems.\nChair of SC 42, Wael William Diab said “International standards being developed by IEC and ISO are part of the solution to the social and ethical issues that AI presents.\n“Foundational standards being developed by SC 42 are the glue between regulatory requirements and technical innovation.”\nAbout ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 42\nISO/IEC JTC1 SC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee also organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available.\nThe WTO and ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 42 have recently established a liaison which enables the WTO to contribute to the committee's work."

IEC Standards are paving the way for the technology to be used safely and efficiently.\nExtracting and making sense of big data\nMachine learning (ML) algorithms can analyze medical images to aid in the early detection of diseases such as cancer and provide accurate diagnoses. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can sift through vast amounts of medical literature and electronic health records to assist in research and clinical decision support. AI-powered virtual assistants can streamline administrative tasks, improve patient engagement and enhance the overall healthcare experience.\n97% of healthcare data goes unused because it’s unstructured. That includes X-rays and medical records. ML allows healthcare professionals to structure and index this information. In addition, ML and NLP help healthcare organizations understand the meaning of clinical data.\nElectronic health records (EHR) play a crucial role in this process by capturing all relevant patient data, enabling quick and easy access to medical information in a digital format when patients visit healthcare providers or hospitals. These records allow for the extraction of data, enabling the identification of commonalities between groups, such as those at risk of certain conditions like diabetes.\nRead the full article on etech"

Commented versions (CMVs) are red line versions in which IEC experts have added significant and extensive comments explaining the changes to the publication. \nHoisting machines were invented to help human beings carry and displace heavy loads that they would otherwise have had trouble lifting. While hoisting in ancient times was performed thanks to hydraulic energy or the pull of an animal, nowadays most hoisting machines are powered by electricity.\nThey are commonplace on building sites, in shipyards for unloading goods, but also in healthcare, where they are used to lift people with mobility issues out of bed. They include different types of cranes and winchers of all types, as well as storage and retrieval machines.\nThis part of IEC 60204 (IEC 60204-32) applies to the application of electrical and electronic equipment and systems to hoisting machines and related equipment. This standard is applicable to equipment or parts of equipment not exceeding 1 000 V alternating current (AC) or 1 500 V direct current (DC) between lines and with nominal frequencies not exceeding 200 Hz. \nThis third edition of the standard replaces the previous one, published in 2008, and which has now been withdrawn. Safety requirements mentioned in the standard are far reaching and include, for instance, protection against short circuits, electric shock or over voltages due to lightning and to switching surges. “We are very happy to publish this third edition as a CMV – it enables us to thoroughly explain the changes we made compared with the previous edition,” explains IEC TC 44 expert Gerhard Schmid."

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in an ever-growing range of applications, from healthcare to finance to self-driving cars. As these systems become more complex and integrated into our daily lives, IEC and ISO have published an essential new international standard to ensure that they meet all the necessary quality standards and specifications.\nISO/IEC 25059 adapts a methodology already used in other ISO/IEC Standards for assessing the quality of software and systems. These so-called SQuaRE (Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation) standards cover various aspects of software quality, such as requirements, design, testing, maintenance, and evaluation.\n“We are leveraging a very successful base of existing well-adopted standards on software quality,” said Wael William Diab, who chairs SC 42, the IEC and ISO committee on AI. “The fact that we are dealing with quality in the context of developing systems reflects that SC 42 is looking at the entire ecosystem and lifecycle including ensuring quality development and deployment of AI systems.”  \nThe new standard provides quality models for AI systems with consistent terminology for specifying, measuring and evaluating system quality. It includes quality characteristics and sub-characteristics that are specific to AI, as well as those that are already defined in software quality standards like ISO/IEC 25010. \n“ISO/IEC 25059 defines quality requirements for AI systems and also provides guidelines for measuring and evaluating the quality of AI systems,” said project leader Adam Leon Smith. “Some of the quality characteristics that could be relevant to AI systems include accuracy, interpretability, robustness, fairness, privacy and security.”\nImplementing ISO/IEC 25059 can help to ensure that AI systems are developed and tested to meet the necessary quality standards before they are released to the market. This can include testing the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of AI models, as well as ensuring that the system meets ethical and legal requirements. \n“As the field of AI continues to grow and evolve, ISO/IEC 25059 ensures that AI systems are developed and evaluated to the highest possible quality standards to ensure their safety, reliability, and effectiveness in real-world applications,” said the working group convenor, David Filip.\n“By including both the developer's point of view with the user's point of view via a modular architecture, the SQuaRE series has become essential to many IT systems,” said Domenico Natalie, liaison officer. “Extending the base standards with this approach to AI via ISO/IEC 25059 allows for a consistent and structured framework to assess and evaluate the quality of AI systems, taking into account specific characteristics and sub-characteristics relevant to AI while also leveraging existing software quality standards.”\nIt is important to note that ISO/IEC 25059 provides only the quality models, which serve as a foundation for evaluating AI systems. The evaluation guidance and specific measures and metrics for evaluating AI systems are being developed in a separate technical specification (TS).\nSC 42 expects to publish the new TS next year. This modular architecture of the SQuaRE series allows for the development of specific evaluation guidance tailored to different domains and applications.\nSC 42 worked closely with SC 7, the committee that develops SQuaRE standards, on ISO/IEC 25059. The two committees have established a joint working group on testing of AI systems. \nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is free to attend. Topics covered include, among others, AI applications, novel AI standardization approaches and emerging AI technology trends and requirements."

It aims to address the unique challenges posed by physically dispersed and multi-layered supply chains. \nThe new international standard focuses on three key aspects: gaining visibility into and managing information security risks, responding to risks and integrating information security processes and practices.\nVisibility and risk management\nOne of the primary goals of ISO/IEC 27036-3 is to enhance visibility into supply chains and manage information security risks effectively. With numerous tiers of suppliers and components involved, it becomes crucial for organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate them proactively. \nBy following the guidance provided by the standard, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of the origin, practices and security measures employed by suppliers. This ensures the products and services acquired meet the necessary security requirements.\nResponding to risks\nThe newly published standard recognizes the dynamic nature of supply chains and acknowledges that risks can emerge at any stage. ISO/IEC 27036-3 equips organizations with the necessary knowledge and strategies to respond effectively to risks that may impact information security. \nOrganizations can minimize the potential vulnerabilities introduced through their supply chains by implementing appropriate risk identification and mitigation techniques. This proactive approach strengthens the overall resilience of the information security framework.\nIntegration of information security\nISO/IEC 27036-3 emphasizes the integration of information security processes and practices into the system and software life cycle processes. \nEmbedding information security from the early stages of development can help organizations to build robust security measures into their products and services. This reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced later in the supply chain.\nBenefits and application\nImplementing ISO/IEC 27036-3 offers several key benefits for organizations:\n\n\nincreased visibility and traceability within supply chains enhance the information security capability. \n\n\nacquirers gain a better understanding of the origin and practices associated with their products and services, enabling more effective implementation of information security requirements \n\n\nin the unfortunate event of an information security compromise, organizations have access to vital information about potential compromises and the involved actors, aiding in incident response and mitigation efforts.\n\n\nISO/IEC 27036-3 is applicable to all organizations involved in acquiring or supplying hardware, software and services. While the guidance primarily focuses on the initial acquirer-supplier link, the fundamental steps should be applied throughout the entire supply chain."

        "abstract": "Sustainability goals are becoming important for hospitals and medical and healthcare centres.",
        "content": "According to healthaffairs.org, the healthcare industry is among the most carbon-intensive service sectors in the industrialized world. It is responsible for 4,4 to 4,6% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and similar fractions of toxic air pollutants, largely stemming from fossil fuel combustion. These emissions arise directly from healthcare facilities, as well as indirectly from the supply chain of healthcare goods and services.\nIn the US, several medical professionals and policymakers have been pushing for change, and for the reduction of global emissions in the healthcare sector, as the dangers of climate change are increasingly hitting home. One of the reasons for this growing awareness is that climate change has deleterious effects on people’s health, with elderly patients and the mentally ill most at risk. Moreover, CO2 emissions generally increase respiratory, cardiovascular and cancer-related illnesses in the global population.\nThe American Society of Anaesthesiologists, for instance, has warned of the environmental footprint of inhaled anaesthetics, which include desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane and halothane used in general anaesthesia, as well as nitrous oxide. They recommend the use of safe and environmentally preferable alternatives such as regional and total intravenous anaesthesia.\nAcross Europe, several hospitals are growing vegetables in rooftop gardens and moving away from using disposable plates and cups. Medical centres are generally being more consistent about reuse and recycling. The IEC is helping refurbished medical imaging equipment to be used safely in a circular economy perspective by publishing IEC 63077, which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of such equipment. The publication is developed by IEC Technical Committee 62, which issues standards for medical devices, software and systems. \"Reusing medical equipment which has been contaminated by infections, blood or other fluids is very different from reusing machines in a factory and the requirements are therefore quite stringent\", explains Regina Geierhofer, Secretary of IEC TC 62.\nEnergy harvesting for medical wearables\nEnergy harvesting technologies are used by some hospitals to recover wasted energy for heating hospital rooms. Even more exciting are the advances being made in the medical wearables field, where body and ambient heat is recovered to power devices, instead of using cumbersome batteries. Implantable and wearable medical devices (IWM) enable the monitoring of physical activity, rehabilitation, early diagnosis as well as evaluating the progression of diseases.\nThe IEC is paving the way for these technologies to be used safely and efficiently. The IEC 62830-1 series, prepared by IEC TC 47, includes methods for evaluating the performance of vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvesting devices. Standards for piezoelectric technology are developed by IEC TC 49, which addresses piezoelectric, dielectric and electrostatic devices.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "IEC Systems Committee for Smart Energy expert Frances Cleveland explains what the different IEC Technical Committees do to integrate EVs into the grid.",
        "content": "Utilities everywhere are concerned that the charging load for EVs will greatly increase the load on power grids. In many places, the charging load could exceed the existing demand from residential consumers during peak hours. As more electric vehicle charging points are deployed, it becomes increasingly important to manage flexibility of both the power levels and the time of charging.\nFor many years, academic papers have proposed using EV batteries as a form of energy storage that can provide services to the power grid even if only charging. But now there are many research and pilot projects around the world that are deploying some form of bidirectional flow of energy (charging and discharging), either as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) or vehicle-to-home (V2H), with EVs able to sell power to the main grid and even support the energy management of microgrids. One of the driving ideas behind these projects is to provide a means of storing energy in the EV from variable renewable resources, like solar and wind, for use at other times. This implies that EVs can actually be viewed as a type of distributed energy resource (DER).\nMany IEC Technical Committees involved\nThe purpose of the IEC System Committee for Smart Energy (SyC-SE) is to help coordinate and guide the various efforts across the different IEC Technical Committees and working groups. One of its current projects is to produce a document, IEC 63460, that will describe the “Architecture and use-cases for EVs to provide grid support functions”, or more familiarly called “EV-as-DER”. Many of the members of the EV-as-DER group are also members of the other EV-related technical groups, thus leading to lively discussions and hopefully good consensus. Most of this standard will be concerned with the identifying of realistic EV charging and discharging configurations, and the communication and control between the various actors, grid system operators, aggregators, premises energy management, and EV charging systems. The results from this document will hopefully help other technical groups to take the grid-support capabilities of EVs into account as they develop their own standards.\nThe IEC has many different groups addressing aspects of EVs and their charging from the grid. For the physical aspects, IEC TC 8 and its subcommittees work on the overall system aspects of electricity supply systems. IEC TC 120 is responsible for standardization in the field of grid integrated energy storage systems. IEC TC 69 prepares publications related to electrical power/energy transfer systems for electrically propelled road vehicles, including some physical charger connection standards such as IEC 61851. TC 69 has also worked with ISO to develop charging communication protocols such as ISO/IEC 15118. It has established joint working groups with other IEC TCs to manage the higher-level charging infrastructure with use cases and communication protocols and is currently developing IEC 63110 and IEC 63382.\nIEC TC 57 has a utility perspective and has developed sophisticated communication and automation standards for power systems control equipment and control centre systems. These standards include IEC 61850 for substations, distribution automation, and more recently DER. The Common Information Model (CIM), covered in the standards IEC 61968, IEC 61970 and IEC 62325, is focused on grid management applications and market interactions. In addition, IEC TC 65 has developed some standards describing energy management systems for industrial sites and the subcommittee IEC SC 23K is working on standards for energy management within residential and commercial premises. Complementing these energy standards is IEC TC 13 which provides metering standards.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "The IEC National Committee (NC) for Mexico has hosted a strategy workshop on the fringes of the recent IEC Board meeting in Mexico City. The event brought together leaders of Mexican industry, policymakers and standardization experts to discuss critical topics and identify key priorities.\nThe Mexican NC President and IEC Board member, Juan Rosales, welcomed participants to the workshop and set the stage for the day's discussions. The workshop started with two notable presentations that provided valuable insights into the strategic vision of the Mexican electrotechnical industry regarding its participation in international standards development.\nSalvador Portillo Arellano, President of the Cámara Nacional de Manufacturas Eléctricas (CANAME), and Enrique Yamuni Roblesand, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria Electrónica, de Telecomunicaciones y Tecnologías de la Información (CANIETI), highlighted Mexico's commitment to driving innovation and promoting collaboration.\nThey presented Mexico's active participation in the IEC as a significant strength and called for even more engagement. They argued that promoting the use of IEC standards and conformity assessment systems should be a priority in Mexico's energy policy, as these standards provide a solid foundation for achieving efficiency, quality and security. \nThe IEC President, Jo Cops, shared the organization's vision and strategic plan, emphasizing the importance of an all-electrical and digital society. Mr Cops underscored the commitment of the IEC to facilitating the transition towards a sustainable and resilient future through intelligent electrification and cutting-edge digital technologies.\nThe workshop featured several engaging panel discussions that covered a range of crucial topics. The first panel, \"All-Electrical and Digital Society,\" featured insightful presentations by Ian Oppermann, an IEC International Board member from Australia, who discussed the IEC and ISO Smart Standards project. \nPhilippe Vollet, Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE), spoke about the role of IEC cyber security standards and conformity assessment in protecting critical infrastructure and facilitating trade. In the same session, two Mexican experts, Juan Diaz Mazadiego, a member of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB), and Domingo Avila, a member of the IEC Standardization Board, outlined the challenges and opportunities Mexico faces in its participation in the IEC.\nThe second panel, \"Environmental, Social, and Governance Sustainability,\" addressed the pressing need to prioritize sustainability in the electrotechnical industry. The SMB Chair, Vimal Mahendru, emphasized the critical importance of supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals through standardization and conformity assessment. \nGilles Nativel, an IEC Board member from France, addressed the IEC's new governance structure. He emphasized the complex ecosystem of the IEC as a member-based organization and the importance of aligning national complexities with the global agenda.\nPablo Moreno Cadena, Corporate Affairs Director of the appliances multinational, Mabe, shared perspectives on sustainability challenges specific to Mexican industry, highlighting the need for collective action.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion took centre stage in the third panel. Veronica Lancaster, an IEC Board member from the United States, stressed the importance of diversity and inclusion in standards development. She urged the audience to download and read the IEC Diversity Statement.\nAndrew Chow, an IEC Board member from Singapore, discussed IEC work on gender-responsive standards. He suggested that the failure of standards to account for women was in part caused by the under-representation of women in STEM. \nArmando Garcia Mena, the Senior Manager of Talent Management and Diversity at Schneider Electric, presented actions being taken within the Mexican electrotechnical industry to foster diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThroughout the workshop, participants engaged in vibrant discussions, sharing insights. The event underscored Mexico's growing significance as a key player in the global trade of electrotechnical products, emphasizing the need to leverage IEC standards and conformity assessment to empower competitive companies and serve stakeholders more efficiently.\nWorkshop participants explored how industry can adapt to evolving market demands. The significance of quick and agile responses to market needs was acknowledged, reflecting the growing expectations of industry stakeholders.\nThe workshop highlighted the central role of the IEC in addressing Mexico's specific needs and fostering collaboration between national and international standards bodies.\nSustainability emerged as a crucial theme, with participants recognizing the fundamental importance of sustainability. The urgency to act in parallel and sync with current and aspirational needs was emphasized, underlining the shared responsibility of all stakeholders to build a sustainable future.\nWrapping up the workshop, the IEC Secretary-General, Philippe Metzger, stressed that achieving the goals set forth by the IEC was more akin to running a marathon than running a sprint. He said that the collective effort, continuous momentum and unwavering dedication of all stakeholders were essential components in driving progress and ensuring the industry's long-term success."

        "content": "In today’s world, technology is evolving at such a rapid pace, it’s almost impossible to keep up to date let alone develop technical standards for conformity assessment or product safety. The committee I chair, IEC TC 106, has been facing these challenges since the 5G technical specification standards group 3GPP decided to rollout the first 5G standards in 2018, two years earlier than initially planned.\nThey took the decision to enable telecom operators globally to deploy 5G faster and ahead of schedule. For the IEC and other testing bodies, the flow on effect was immediate — how to speed up the development cycle for assessment standards.\nAdding to the complexity of the challenge, 5G presented new assessment challenges due to the advanced nature of the technology, including beamforming antennas, new radios, mmWave frequencies and optimised traffic schedulers, all leading to more efficiency and the need for different test methods.\nTC 106 took the following approach:\n1. Embracing a collaborative and agile culture\nWe had to adopt a ‘publish or perish’ approach and develop a very open collaborative style of work, including all stakeholders:  academia, test labs, regulators, operators and technical experts. The open culture in TC 106 included embracing Young Professionals and young engineers pioneering the newer technologies and agile ways of working.  \nTraditional standards methods can be very laborious and would have introduced unnecessary delays and hindered innovation.\n2. Recognition and sharing our stories.\nWe took a deliberate decision to publish blogs and articles with the IEC along the journey, sharing what we had achieved and the steps we were taking.  This gave the TC 106 experts pride in their work and efforts.  \nIt also enabled more collaboration, as others joined us wanting to be part of an exciting new way of working.\n3. Young Professionals and young engineers\nTC 106 has been a big supporter of the IEC Young Professionals Programme and indeed we chose a young engineer to lead the 5G mmWave device testing TR project.  This ensured a new, faster collaborative style of leadership that worked very well.  \nMany traditional ‘older experts’ said it couldn’t be done in 12 months but were so pleased when it was, and now embrace this way of working.\n4. Deliverables\nAs they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. TC 106 delivered the following for 5G: \n\n5G mmWave Device assessments — fast track an IEC Technical Report (TR) in 12 months to capture all of the available scientific test methods that are brand new. \n\n\tA TR was chosen to be the most efficient approach. It satisfied IEC National Committees happy that it was informative whist still exploring new test methods.  This enabled freer discussions and innovation, with experts able to speak and contribute more.  \n\n\tIf we had opted for a normative publication, it would have completely slowed the process down as NC’s would have been far more reserved, driven by local issues and not wanting to be compelled into embracing something new. \n\n\tGlobal mmWave networks and device suppliers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, among others, all used the TR for device safety assessments. For the first time, regulators adopted the methods described in a TR!\n\n\n\n5G mmWave IEC/IEEE International Standard — this was developed in 3 years using the TR as the starting point, which gave a huge advantage. \n\t \n5G Base Station Test methods — TC 106 included the latest test methods in the already existing IEC 62232 ED2 and developed a case studies TR in 2019 that is referenced globally. \n\n\tIn 2022, IEC 62232 ED3 was published, building on the earlier methods and now including 5G advanced test methods, again keeping up with technology.\n\nBased on our experience in IEC TC 106, here, in reverse order, are the top 10 tips for keeping up with fast-paced technology to develop more relevant standards that meet the current needs of industry and society:  \n\nAdopt a collaborative and agile culture — this will challenge some people. \nTell your stories publicly and acknowledge the contribution of all experts.\n\nEmbrace Young Professionals and indeed young engineers — they are our future.\nTailor faster deliverables to keep pace with technology.\nDevelop a roadmap, strategic plan, review progress and adapt as needed.\n Don’t get stuck in administrative procedures or red tape.\nChallenge the status quo and always look for more efficient ways of working.\n Accept and embrace mistakes, or issues, and learn from them.\nInvite observers and outside stakeholders to collaborate with you – embrace their ideas and feedback.\nHave fun and make standards development enjoyable. This makes teams so much better and far more rewarding — experts will be knocking on the door to join you! \n\nLast year, we updated our Strategic Business Plan and published an article here on our work in this important field."

IEC has standards to help.\nVentilators, organ support machines, infusion pumps and robotics in surgery are just a few examples of connected medical devices, in addition to the plethora of those that patients can wear or ingest for remote monitoring.\nIncorporating AI into IoMT devices and applications enables the analysis of the huge amounts of data that these devices can generate, enabling better disease diagnosis, treatment and management.\nAn example of this was presented at a recent workshop on AI, led by the IEC and ISO joint- committee for AI, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC 42.\nMarc Fiammante, PhD student at the Paris Brain Institute described a tool to help medical staff make quick decisions on the use of a treatment that could save the lives of thousands of newborn babies.\nBy reading and analyzing data from EEGs (electroencephalograms), it can provide information about the severity of cases of newborns with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), or lack of oxygen to the brain. This then helps doctors decide the right treatment protocol to use.\nYet with more and more connected devices and systems, the risk of cyber attacks has grown exponentially. Estimates show that global weekly cyber attacks rose 22% in Q1 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, making healthcare the third most targeted industry in 2023, after education/research and government/military.\nYet there is much that can be done to prevent cyber-attacks.\nIEC develops standards that can help healthcare providers put comprehensive measures in place for managing cybersecurity threats and responding effectively.\nIEC TR 60601-4-5, Medical electrical equipment – Part 4-5: Guidance and interpretation – Safety-related technical security specifications provides guidance on the secure and reliable availability of medical devices and healthcare services even where there are IT security breaches.

        "content": "Like for many other technologies related to the health sector, COVID-19 has had a major impact on the use of robots and robotics in medical care. The use of droids surged during the pandemic, and this has changed many ways of doing things.\nWhile robotic arms have been used in surgery since the 1980s, the technology has matured and is now employed for increasingly complex tasks, a trend which accelerated during and after COVID. Robotic arms are regularly used to assist minimally invasive surgeries which are performed through very small incisions. Working manually through a button-sized incision is difficult, even for an experienced surgeon. Surgical robots help to make these procedures easy and accurate, with a goal to reduce infections and other complications The surgeon controls the arms while seated at a computer near the operating table. This enables him to have a high-definition, 3D view of the surgical site.\nThe IEC is leading the way when it comes to safety and performance of medical equipment standards. IEC Technical Committee 62 prepares standards for medical equipment, software and systems, including for surgery. It publishes IEC 80601-2-77, which specifies particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of robotically assisted surgical equipment.\nMoreover IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, offers testing and certification for the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of electrical equipment for medical use, to IEC International Standards.\nNew standard could be in the works\nThe use of robots for disinfection became common practice during the pandemic: in Chinese, Italian and many other hospitals around the world, these were employed for cleansing patient rooms and operating theatres. The benefits of employing droids for this sort of thankless and tiring work have become obvious and they are now used as a matter of course in many healthcare facilities. The cleansing devices use a mobile array of powerful short wavelength UV-C lights that emit enough energy to literally shred the DNA of any dangerous micro-organisms. The cleansing process itself is far from new: UV-C germicidal irradiation has been used in medical sanitation since the middle of the 20th century. At wavelengths of 200-280 nanometres (nm), UV-C light breaks molecular bonds in the DNA of microorganisms and viruses, stopping them from reproducing.\nDespite it being a well-established way of destroying germs, using UV-C devices is not without risk. UV-C irradiation can cause injury to the skin and eyes if people are in the vicinity of the device for a too long period of time. The pandemic prompted both the IEC and the Global Lighting Association (GLA) to act together quickly to limit the risks of using such equipment. A publicly available specification, IEC PAS 63313, was issued as a result of their joint efforts.\n“The IEC has established a new working group, TC 34/WG 23 which looks at UV-C irradiation for germicidal purposes. We are considering the proposal of a new work item, based on the PAS. The idea would be to develop a new IEC Standard, which will initially deal with the safety aspects related to UV-C radiation used for disinfection. The new work item must still be approved by the members of TC 34,” explains John Gielen, who is one of the convenors of the new working group.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

Presenting at the event, Marc Fiammante, PhD student at the Paris Brain Institute and retired IBM Fellow, detailed the work underway to develop a tool to help medical staff make quick decisions on the use of the hypothermia protocol in newborns with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).\nMr Fiammante has also been active in the IEC and ISO committee for AI, SC 42, who organized the workshop, since its conception.\nHIE is a form of brain damage caused by lack of oxygen to the brain that can occur during or just after childbirth. It is caused by difficulties during delivery, such as the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby’s neck. It affects up to 2.5 per 1000 births globally, resulting in severe disability or death in thousands of babies each year.\nThe gold standard treatment protocol to treat HIE, said Mr Fiammante, is induced hypothermia, whereby the baby’s core temperature is lowered for 72 hours to halt the destruction of neurons in the brain and allow the baby’s brain to recover.\n“The protocol needs to be activated within six hours of birth to be effective,” he said, “but it is painful and not without its risks, so you need to be sure you are doing it for the right reason.”\nOne of the means to determine eligibility for hypothermia is through an EEG (electroencephalogram), but this requires qualified neurologists to interpret them, which is not always possible in emergency situations. What’s more, previous tools to detect severity of HIE through EEGs have not yet proven accurate enough to be used in making the decision.\n“While more work needs to be done, based on current data, our tool appears to meet the criteria to be used as a decision aid, and we are in the process of filing a patent and publishing a formal article,” he said.\nThe workshop featured speakers from industry, academia and regulatory bodies, including Google. Microsoft and WTO, with the theme of fostering responsible and trustworthy AI.\nIt covered four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.\nLatest AI trends were discussed, along with examples of how AI can be beneficial for society and how standardization of AI can help to address the requirements and challenges of its rapid evolution, including SC 42’s work on a new management system standard (MSS).\nChair of SC 42, Wael William Diab said that workshops such as these are important to ensure the committee work remains relevant and impactful: “Insights gained from this workshop series presentations such as this help SC 42 in its strategic planning to enable the benefits of AI through responsible adoption,” he said.\n“For instance SC 42 has a portfolio of work to enable trustworthy AI systems and recently started a new project on beneficial AI.”\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nIt works with health-related committees in IEC and ISO, with an initial joint working group with ISO/TC 215 focused on AI-enabled health informatics.\nThe committee also organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available."

        "content": "The IEC has recently published a new commented version (CMV) of IEC 62208, which provides general requirements for empty enclosures used in low-voltage switchgear and controlgear assemblies. IEC 62208:2023 CMV allows the user to identify the changes made to the previous IEC 62208, edition 2.0. Comments from experts who worked on the new edition are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.\nEmpty enclosures for low-voltage switchgear and controlgear assemblies refer to the physical structures or cabinets designed to house electrical equipment used in low-voltage power distribution systems. These enclosures are typically constructed from materials such as metal or plastic and provide protective housing for various components, including circuit breakers, switches, contactors, relays, meters, and control devices.\nThe purpose of these enclosures is to ensure the safety and functionality of the electrical equipment within them. They provide physical protection against environmental factors such as dust, moisture, and mechanical impact. Additionally, they help prevent accidental contact with live parts, reducing the risk of electric shock.\nIEC 62208 specifies the constructional and performance requirements for enclosures that are intended to house electrical equipment such as circuit breakers, switches, and control devices. It ensures that the enclosures provide adequate protection for the installed electrical components and comply with safety standards.\nIEC 62208:2023 CMV has been prepared by IEC TC 121: Switchgear and controlgear and their assemblies for low voltage. According to Jordi Sabaté, convenor of the group that developed IEC 62208 “The CMV of IEC 62208 allows us to really explain the changes with the previous edition, notably the alignment of the requirements and test procedures with the newest relevant standards.”"

        "content": "Since COVID-19, the smart wearable device market for healthcare has been booming. According to consultancy Verified Market Research, the market size for global smart wearable healthcare devices was valued at USD 13,8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 37,4 billion by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate of 13,1% from 2021 to 2028.  \nThe prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular problems are prompting an increase in the use of continuous monitoring devices. Benefits are obvious: smart wearable devices offer the possibility of improving patient care quality while lowering the cost of treatment. Wearables enable doctors to monitor their patients remotely and they also help patients become more pro-active about their own health. Patients can collect their own data and report it in a digital format, potentially avoiding the need for in-person appointments. Wearables can make medical care more accessible to everyone - especially in areas where doctors are difficult to find and book appointments with.\nOne of the caveats is that tech-generated medical data can potentially be hacked. IEC International Standards can help to meet some of these challenges by ensuring that the technologies used are safe and perform to agreed benchmarks. Several standards help to ensure the cyber security of medical devices and protect patient safety. For example, IEC TR 60601-4-5:2021 provides detailed guidance on adapting IEC 62443 to the specific needs of the healthcare sector.\nAnother key series of standards is IEC 80001, which provides guidance on the management of risk related to the use of medical devices in a networked environment. These standards defines a risk management process that covers the entire lifecycle of a networked medical device, from design and development to decommissioning. They focus on identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with networked medical devices, including cybersecurity threats and failures in communication between devices.\nIEC 80001 is recommended for healthcare organizations and medical device manufacturers that use networked medical devices. It can also help organizations meet regulatory requirements related to medical device safety and security. It is one of the key publications issued by IEC Technical Committee 62, which prepares standards for medical equipment, software and systems.\nIEC TC 124 prepares standards for wearable electronic devices and technologies. It is preparing to publish two new standards either at the end of this year or beginning of 2024. One of them, IEC 63203-402-3 is the first edition of a standard which deals with accuracy of heart rate measurements for wearables. The other, IEC 63203-402-2, also a first edition, deals with how step counts are measured in wearable devices.\nIn addition, IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, offers testing and certification for the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of electrical equipment for medical use, to IEC International Standards.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

Presenting at the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Global Digital Compact Deep Dive on Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies, Chair of IEC and ISO’s joint committee on AI, Wael William Diab, highlighted how standards can provide the link between regulatory requirements and industry innovation, with global consensus.\n“Our programme of work brings together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the world, as well as varying experience backgrounds, from those involved in the development to those looking to regulate to those looking to use the technology,” he said.\nThe IEC/ISO joint committee, SC 42, produces international standards for AI, as well as guidance to IEC and ISO technical committees on AI applications. Their goal is to enable broad responsible adoption of AI that can realize its benefits and proactively ensure responsible trustworthy ethical behaviours.\nThe committee has over 56 member countries with, on average, more than 250 experts participating in its plenaries. The committee also works with many international organizations to ensure a harmonious global ecosystem.\nIn addition, SC 42 organizes a free bi-annual ISO/IEC AI workshop that is open to the public free of charge and looks at novel standards approaches, AI applications, emerging requirements and technology trends and beneficial AI.\nAt the UN Deep Dive on AI session, Diab explained the holistic approach of the committee that takes into account the whole AI ecosystem. It looks at driving factors and requirements, such as societal and ethical requirements for responsible AI in order to understand the full context.\nFrom there, they develop a platform of horizontal standards that can then be used across applications and uses cases. Examples of their standards include: foundational standards such as terminology and frameworks, guidance for application developers, governance of AI, AI data ecosystem, trustworthiness (including risk management), computational approaches, testing, functional safety and AI systems, and ethics.\nOne of their objectives is to enable certification. SC 42 is developing a portfolio of standards that leverage the management system standard approach used in high-profile standards such as ISO 9001 for quality management and more recently the ISO/IEC 27001 standard for cybersecurity.\nISO/IEC 42001 will be the standard that looks at the process by which an AI system is developed to ensure that many of the protocols to ensure responsible AI are followed.\nSC 42 standards are developed in a horizontal fashion with the intention that they can be used as building blocks by application domains and/or extended. For example, there is work underway with an ISO technical committee to develop standards for AI-enabled health informatics, as well as IEC TC 65/SC 65A on a functional safety standard for AI. \nIn concluding his presentation, Mr Diab highlighted how SC 42’s current programme of work contributes to 12 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that all SDGs are considered when looking at AI-enabled applications. For example, the committee has projects looking at sustainable AI and beneficial AI with its exemplary use cases.\n“We also regularly look at this area through the beneficial AI track in our workshop series,” he said.\nAbout SC 42\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nThe committee organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available. The next SC 42 workshop is taking place on 12 and 14 June 2023.\nThe workshops cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.

        "content": "With the support of IEC Technical Committee 106, Standards Australia's TE-007 experts have carried out rigorous testing of the latest methods for assessing electromagnetic fields (EMF) outlined in IEC 62232:2022. The specialized workshop took place against the picturesque backdrop of Australia’s Gold Coast. \nIt was an opportunity to review the latest tools for testing the safety of 5G networks as they continue to advance worldwide, ushering in a new era of advanced connectivity through mmWave frequencies and innovative beamforming technology. Adopting the latest international test methods ensures that Australia is applying the most up-to-date test methods for 5G EMF assessments, which is a key factor for public safety.   \nThe venue was a specially designed '5G Super Cell' at a local sports ground on the sunny shores of Queensland. The cell site boasted an impressive array of 5G bands, including the cutting-edge 5G mmWave frequencies at 26GHz, in addition to 3G and 4G networks from all major Australian mobile operators.\n\n \n\n \nThe workshop celebrated the adoption of the latest International 5G test methods by Standards Australia and the publication of AS/NZS IEC 62232:2023 Determination of RF field strength, power density and SAR in the vicinity of base stations for the purpose of evaluating human exposure. \nThe workshop included experts from Standards Australia, the IEC, Australian mobile operators Telstra, Optus and TPG Telecom, Australian EMF lest laboratories, academia, International EMF test equipment manufacturer Narda, Air-Met, ARPANSA and the Australian Government Regulator the ACMA.\nHarnessing the collaborative power of a diverse range of experts and stakeholders made for a super exciting workshop that really put 5G to the ultimate test. During the EMF testing, experts loaded the 5G Supercell to very high traffic levels and high throughput reaching peak speeds of over 3.3 Gbps which certainly made for interesting tests.\n\nA key aspect of the workshop was ‘side-by-side comparisons’ to see the variation in test results by different labs and experts.  Applying the latest international methods in 62232 achieved very good alignment between the various test groups which is a key factor in the repeatability and reliability of the results.\nOverall, the multiple testing teams found the maximum EMF levels at the sports ground under very high traffic loads across all mobile bands (including 5G) were less than 1% of the public safety limits.  This is very reassuring to the public.   \nA highlight of the workshop was to test live mmWave beamforming and the efficiency of 5G sending a narrow beam (low-powered radio signal) to a device rather than a broad signal in all directions. Narrow beams increase efficiency as you don’t need to send power where it is not needed.  This minimises interference and reduces EMF.\nAbout the new Australian and IEC 62232 ED3 standard\nThe main updates include:\n\n\nincreased frequency ranges from 100MHz to 300GHz to support millimetre wave base stations\n\n\nassessment of antennas using beamforming \n\n\nassessment methods leveraging the actual transmission levels of base stations during operation\n\n\ncase studies from live 5G networks illustrating transmission levels monitoring and control.\n\n\nThe new standard specifically focuses on test methods to achieve the most accurate assessment of 5G base stations. It recommends using the ‘actual maximum’ transmission levels from real site operation rather than the ‘rated maximum’ that is generally not reached during operation. \nTC 106 is now updating the Technical Report IEC 62669 with the corresponding implementation case studies that will include Australian examples. With 5G revolutionising global wireless connectivity, TC 106 in partnership with the Australian National Committee and other IEC Members, has always been at the forefront of developing the most up-to-date standards and technical reports. \nAcknowledgements\nThe IEC and Standards Australia would like to acknowledge the support from Air-Met Scientific, Narda Safety Test Solutions, and Total Radiation Solutions for hosting and supporting this workshop.\n \n\nWatch more IEC 5G safety videos"

For clinicians and patients, AR/VR technologies provide a more immersive and participatory experience that can improve results. “Training and simulation are a major part of what hospitals are looking to do in order to overcome challenges in staff turnover and to find a better way to train surgical teams,” explains Maayan Wenderow, VP of Marketing at an immersive surgical training provider, which is accredited by the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\nAnalysts at Frost & Sullivan say that VR accelerates skills acquisition and medical product adoption “by smoothing the learning curve”.  Fairly common is the use of VR to review cases before a surgical procedure. Dr Rafael Grossmann, a full-time general, trauma, advanced laparoscopic and robotic surgeon who practices in the US explains, “You can view images of a patient’s specific organs in VR and navigate the map you are going to cross. If your VR system has haptics, you also get some muscle memory to take into the operating room.”\nSurgical simulations have been used by surgeons for decades, but VR goes one step further than practicing on mannequins or human cadavers. Kinesthetic haptics, such as those developed by Wenderow’s company, mimic the physical touch of surgical actions, and accurately simulate the sensations of bone textures, muscle and soft tissue. “You can practice certain operations with haptics such as drilling the bone or injecting the eye and master it before moving onto a human,” Grossmann explains.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

Each level presents unique challenges and requires effective management to achieve desired outcomes. \nISO/IEC 17360:2023 is an international standard for automatic identification and data capture techniques. It specifically addresses the application of RFID technology in supply chain processes.\nFollowing are five ways that the new standard can help to ensure a seamless flow of goods and services from start to finish.\n\n\nConsistent item identification: ISO/IEC 17360 provides specifications for item identification within the supply chain. The standard ensures a consistent and reliable means of identifying and tracking items across various stages by defining tagging requirements for products, packaging, transport units and returnable items.\n\n\nEnhanced data integrity: The standard not only focuses on basic identification but also makes provision for additional information on RFID tags. This enables businesses to encode relevant data, such as batch/lot numbers, expiration dates and other vital information. By maintaining accurate and comprehensive data on RFID tags, companies can ensure improved traceability and information transparency.\n\n\nInteroperability and integration: ISO/IEC 17360 can play a vital role in promoting interoperability and seamless integration between different RFID systems and business applications. The ISO/IEC standard facilitates the exchange of information and smooth communication between systems by specifying the data protocol and air interface standards. This integration minimizes data inconsistencies, eliminates redundancies and enhances overall operational efficiency.\n\n\nPerformance and reliability: ISO/IEC 17360 establishes minimum performance requirements to guarantee the effectiveness of RFID technology within the supply chain. These requirements encompass factors like read range, accuracy, write speed, and reliability. Adhering to these benchmarks ensures consistent performance and reliable data capture throughout the supply chain ecosystem.\n\n\nSustainability and environmental considerations: Acknowledging the growing importance of sustainable practices, ISO/IEC 17360 also emphasizes the reuse and recyclability of RFID tags. ISO/IEC 17360 promotes environmentally friendly supply chain operations by providing guidelines for designing tags with recyclable materials and facilitating their reusability.\n\n\n\nImplementing ISO/IEC 17360 can enable businesses to unlock a host of benefits, including enhanced traceability, reduced errors, improved inventory management and increased customer satisfaction. The new standard can play a key role in driving innovation and setting benchmarks for excellence within the supply chain landscape.\nISO/IEC 17360 is the work of SC 31, the IEC and ISO Joint Technical Committee that develops international standards for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) techniques."

        "content": "David Malpass, the President of the World Bank Group, has highlighted the crucial role of “standards, verification and standardization” in achieving impactful climate mitigation. At the IEC, we wholeheartedly share Mr. Malpass's vision and believe that collaborative efforts are essential to address the challenges posed by climate change.\nMr. Malpass emphasized the need for measurable and lasting greenhouse gas emission reductions, which can be achieved through agreed measurement standards and robust verification processes. We couldn't agree more. The IEC has been at the forefront of developing a common language for assessing and verifying climate-related initiatives. IEC work not only builds trust and investor confidence for public and private funders but also ensures that projects have a tangible and verifiable impact on reducing emissions.\nFor example, IEC conformity assessment experts have developed a carbon footprint verification scheme to provide independent verification that companies use the correct process, methodology and registers to calculate the carbon footprint of a given product. In addition, we are working on a process for measuring and certifying the carbon footprint of both systems and equipment for their entire lifespan.\nStandardization is another critical aspect highlighted by Mr. Malpass. The IEC has long recognized the power of standardization in driving efficiency, interoperability and scalability. By establishing consensus-driven processes and engaging stakeholders from around the world, we develop standards that enable the replication of successful projects and create a solid foundation for widespread adoption.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund (GIF) advances the IEC vision of “a safer and more efficient world” and demonstrates the catalytic impact of international standards and conformity assessment systems in addressing many of today’s social, economic and environmental challenges and in ensuring that technology has a positive impact on society. The first project of the GIF - “Catalyzing innovation for circular models in Africa – turning battery e-waste into e-resources” is now entering its implementation phase. Through the GIF and its projects, the IEC would like to elevate the global level of ambition on the value that international standards and conformity assessment can bring to the development agenda. \nIn his blog post, Mr. Malpass also underlined the importance of attracting more concessional resources for global public goods. Here, the IEC's Affiliate Country Programme plays a significant role. By extending our reach to developing countries, we provide them with access to IEC International Standards and the knowledge of international experts, empowering them to participate in global climate action efforts. Through this programme, we aim to enhance awareness, facilitate adoption and promote the use of standards in these countries, ultimately driving sustainable development.\nIEC Standards and conformity assessment play a pivotal role in advancing climate action. We must continue to work together, leveraging our expertise, to address the urgent challenges posed by climate change. International cooperation can amplify the opportunities afforded by standardization and verification to forge a sustainable and resilient future for all.\nAs a key objective of the evolution and reform of the development finance architecture is to help the world respond to ongoing and future crises, and with the international Summit on a New Global Financing Pact taking place this June in Paris, we envisage future collaborations with a range of partners including the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to deal with challenges firmly within the IEC’s mandate including energy access, renewable energy, climate change and carbon neutrality."

And while renewables such as offshore wind and floating solar are slowly being deployed in coastal regions of oceans, marine energy harnessed from tides, waves, river currents and ocean thermal energy converters (OTEC) systems have had a slow start. This is now about to change.\n\nNovel designs and concepts that underpin marine energy generation require systematic verification and a validation process to identify, quantify, analyze and manage operational risks of deployment. \nThe Technology Qualification (TQ) process through the IEC technical specification (IEC TS 62600-4) provides a starting point for marine energy converters to achieve certification, which is an important step to attract finance and provide confidence that the technologies have been independently assessed in terms of safety, efficiency and reliability. \nToday, the world’s first internationally recognized Feasibility Statement for a tidal energy converter was awarded to a Scottish marine energy systems manufacturer: Flex Marine Power Ltd. This was a major step in opening a pathway for the certification and the manufacture of scalable and affordable marine power-generation solutions that can be deployed in a wide range of coastal locations.  \nThe Feasibility Statement was awarded by Lloyd’s Register which is the first and only Renewable Energy Certification Body (RECB) with a scope in Marine Energy that has been accepted by the International Electrotechnical Commission for Renewable Energy (IECRE). The IECRE is a global renewable energy conformity assessment system and a part of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) which brings together 174 countries.\nFor questions and further information please contact:\nGabriela Ehrlich\nTel: +41 22 919 0278\nEmail: geh@iec.ch"

        "content": "A commented version of IEC 60601-2-46 ED4 has recently been published by IEC Technical Committee 62, which prepares standards focusing on the safety and performance of medical equipment, software, and systems. The standard is part of the IEC 60601 series which specifies safety and performance requirements for medical electrical equipment. It is the first IEC TC 62 Standard to be a CMV.\nCommented versions (CMVs) are red line versions in which IEC experts have added significant and extensive comments explaining the changes to the publication. The fourth edition of IEC 60601-2-46 specifies the basic safety and performance requirements for operating tables, whether with or without electrical parts.\nEssential tool invented in the 18th Century\nThe history of the operating table goes back to the 18th Century, where it was devised to help with lithotomies, the removal of bladder stones, a very common ailment in those days, from which many did not recover. It is reported that from 1771-1773 at the Charité and Hôtel Dieu hospitals in Paris anywhere from a third to half of lithotomy patients died.\nWe have come a long way since then, so much so that we tend to forget how indispensable operating tables have become: no hospital surgery can be performed without them. The operating table is one of the key tools used by a medical team during surgery and is essential to provide a safe surgical experience for the patient. The main goal when using an operating table is to provide stable support for the work area during surgery.\nSafety in the operating room is a key element of medical success, and the use of operating tables is an effective way to ensure that the progress of surgery is safe. The various settings provided by the table allow the medical team to move more easily during surgery, in addition to providing a safe and comfortable environment for the patient.\nIEC 60601-2-46 ED 4 specifies how to ensure maximum stability of the devices. It notably indicates that operating tables shall be subjected to a safe working load. Foot operated control devices are also specified and must not be smaller than a certain size. The list goes on and ranges from electromagnetic compatibility to radiation protection.\n“We are very happy to have issued the CMV of IEC 60601-2-46 ED 4, which is such a broadly used standard in the medical field. We hope it will be of use to medical manufacturers and medical staff around the world,” says Jean-Pierre Breysse, one the TC 62 experts who worked on the standard."

        "content": "Veronica Lancaster is an expert involved in two IEC Technical Committees, is on the American Standards Institute (ANSI) Board of Directors, Vice-President of Standardization at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), President of the US National Committee of the IEC, and a member of the IEC Board. She is equally President of the Board of Directors for Women in Standards.\nShe answers our questions about the main challenges facing IEC and ANSI experts in standardization - including how to get more women involved.\nDo you think the standardization process is adapted to the world of quickly evolving consumer tech?\nThat’s a great question and I don’t have the answer. It is difficult to get innovative start-ups in consumer technology involved in standardization because their time is so focused on creating. CTA represents the entire consumer tech industry, which includes these innovative start-ups. We try to communicate that taking part in standardization will give them an advantage in the market because they participate alongside their competitors. That is our pitch, and it is sometimes successful.  However, start-up founders typically want to see things happen in months, which is not a realistic time-frame for the development of standards. I think we need more discussion of these challenges, together with standards professionals and multiple standards developing organizations. Another challenge is making sure we have enough volunteers to do the work. People tend to over-volunteer and then discover they don’t have the time to devote to multiple projects across multiple committees and multiple standards organizations.\nWhat are the standardization challenges for ANSI?\nOne challenge is succession planning and transitioning the younger generation of engineers into a career in standardization. I have been involved in standardization for around 25 years and I love it. I also understand the importance of passing on the torch to younger experts, which requires succession planning and mentoring. For instance, at CTA, I have mentored Kerrianne Haresign, who is a brilliant standards professional and expert in TC 100 and TC 124. When I was elected President of the US National Committee, I proposed that she become the Convenor of the working group considering new work in emerging topics, such as the Metaverse.\nThere is also a challenge in getting all the right voices heard. Consumers are a great example. ANSI has set up a fund to bring consumers to the standardization table and help them understand the work and why it is important. ANSI also supports younger professionals through its “Next Generation” award, which is given annually, as well as the Young Professionals Programme in the IEC.\nWhat are your suggestions to improve gender inclusion in the IEC?\nI will start with my own experience in IEC TC 100, which prepares standards for multimedia, audio and video equipment. When I began in the TC, there were a few other women and we gravitated towards each other. We began this natural networking and giving support to one another and to new female members who joined. Over time, this resulted in bigger events, such as TC 100 Networking Dinners for Women. We supported each other’s growth. We have a woman Chair, Ulrike Haltrich, and other prominent women who are role models, like Kate Grant, who is the Chair of the Advisory Group for Strategy and manages TA 16. Dr. Xiaoying Zhao is the Head of Delegation for China. I think that the IEC can play an important role in creating and supporting these types of networking environments, which allow women to help each other and boost each other’s work. For younger women in the field, seeing other women in senior roles can inspire confidence that women can achieve positions of authority. That was the thinking behind the Women at IEC lunch during the last General Meeting in San Francisco: get women together to network, learn from each other, and to support each other.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "content": "One of the many highlights of the recent ISO/IEC plenary on artificial intelligence was a discussion about synthetic data. The SC 42 plenary approved work on a new technical report about synthetic data in the context of AI systems. \nSynthetic data refers to artificially generated data that mimics real-world data and can be derived from real-world data or generated purely from algorithms or mathematical models. \nIn some cases, synthetic data is designed to preserve the characteristics and structure of the original data while protecting privacy and confidentiality. This is particularly valuable when working with sensitive data types, such as medical records or financial information, where privacy regulations and ethical considerations restrict data sharing. \nGenerally, this process is referred to as anonymization so that any references to sensitive information are removed.  Examples of this include fuzzing (varying some values by small random amounts) in order to prevent the identification of specific individuals. \nSynthetic data can also be used to augment existing datasets by generating additional samples that capture a broader range of scenarios, variations, or outliers, or simply to provide a large enough dataset to train a machine-learning model. This helps to improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of AI models. \nImportantly, synthetic data enables researchers and developers to create controlled and repeatable experiments. By manipulating the parameters and characteristics of the synthetic data generation process, they can explore different scenarios and evaluate the performance and behaviour of AI models under various conditions. \nSynthetic data generation techniques include methods like generative adversarial networks (GANs), which involve training a model to generate new data samples that closely resemble the distribution of the original data. The methods currently drawing the most interest are generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. \nLarge text-to-image models can take short natural language prompts as input and use that input to generate text and images that are hard to distinguish from those created by humans. Other approaches include rule-based algorithms, simulation models, or data augmentation techniques that modify existing data samples to create synthetic variations. \nWhile synthetic data has numerous advantages, it is essential to validate its quality and ensure its fidelity to the real-world data it aims to represent. The success of using synthetic data depends on the accuracy and realism achieved in capturing the statistical patterns and relationships present in the original data.  \nLLMs present a number of challenges in this regard as their responses are not completely deterministic (the same prompt can generate different responses), making validation difficult. Also, these models, because they are essentially predicting the next word in a sequence, often “hallucinate” and fabricate completely false information. \nAdditionally, the ethical and legal implications of using synthetic data must be considered to avoid potential biases or misrepresentations. There are already concerns with the generative models relating to the data used to train those models.\nIssues include whether it violates intellectual property rights and the rights associated with the generated data, as well as the frequent examples of proprietary training data emerging unintentionally in generated results.   \nThe SC 42 project focusing on synthetic data will likely aim to identify best practices for the generation, evaluation and use of synthetic data in AI systems. This can help promote the responsible and effective use of synthetic data while addressing privacy concerns and improving the availability and diversity of data for AI research and development."

        "content": "Partnerships and collaboration were key themes of the spring plenary meeting of the IEC and ISO committee on artificial intelligence, SC 42. For the first time since the pandemic, SC 42 held an in-person meeting with remote participation.\nAround 100 delegates attended the meeting in Berlin in person, with an additional 150 dialling in remotely throughout the week. About half the national delegations were headed by women.\nDistinguished keynote speakers highlighted the importance of international standards in the development and deployment of AI systems. They included, among others, Christoph Winterhalter, the CEO of DIN, who opened the meeting, and Devin McDaniels of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nMr. Winterhalter emphasized the importance of the horizontal standards that SC 42 develops for enabling the vertical, sector-specific work of ISO and IEC technical committees. Mr. McDaniels discussed the critical role that standards play in removing technical barriers to trade, which in turn can lead to greater productivity, better supply chain management and lower trade costs.\nMr. McDaniels also underlined the need for the development of a range of new standards to facilitate the work of governments around the world as they increasingly consider policies and regulations to govern AI development and use. The SC 42 Chair, Wael William Diab, stressed the importance of working with partners and stakeholders around the world.\n\"This reflects the critical role that international standards can play to ensure broad responsible adoption of AI. Our collaboration efforts continue to be a central part of our work taking advantage of the comprehensive toolset available to us from liaisons to joint work to outreach\", he said.\nMr Diab thanked IEC and ISO, as well as the 42 SC leadership team, including convenors, editors, secretaries and other experts. \"You have been working tirelessly to make this happen\", he said.\nBuilding on the existing close collaboration with IEC TC 65/SC 65A, delegates approved a potential joint working group for a follow on project. Functional safety is critical in manufacturing industries. It involves assessing potential hazards and implementing measures to mitigate or eliminate them.\nThe principles of functional safety can be applied to AI systems by considering potential hazards, assessing risks and implementing appropriate measures to mitigate these risks.\nDelegates also approved two new technical reports (TR). The first will provide an overview of conceptual frameworks for graded benchmarking of AI system quality characteristics.\nThese frameworks are structured approaches for evaluating and comparing the performance of different AI systems based on specific criteria and metrics, in order to assess their overall quality and effectiveness.\nThe second TR will focus on synthetic data in the context of AI systems. It refers to artificially generated data that mimics real-world data but is not derived from actual observations or measurements.\nSynthetic data allows researchers and developers to create large and diverse datasets without collecting or accessing sensitive or private information. It can also be used to augment existing datasets by generating additional samples that capture a broader range of scenarios, variations, or outliers.\nAlso at the SC 42 plenary, the Chair of CASCO, Reinaldo Figueiredo, presented an overview of their activities and led a discussion about conformity assessment related to AI. CASCO is the ISO committee responsible for developing policy related to conformity assessment, but it does not perform conformity assessment activities. \nIt works closely with the IEC and the majority of CASCO documents are published as joint ISO and IEC documents.\nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available. The next SC 42 workshop is taking place on 12 and 14 June 2023.\nThe workshops cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements.

        "content": "In today's interconnected world, international trade relies heavily on digital systems and data exchange. International standards and conformity assessment can help ensure the security and integrity of these digital transactions. \nTechnical barriers to trade (TBT) can emerge when countries or organizations have varying cyber security practices, which hinder the smooth flow of goods and services. To address this issue, international standards provide a common framework for cyber security. \nTwo of the best-known and most trusted cyber security standards are ISO/IEC 27001 for IT and IEC 62443 for the operational technology (OT) found in cyber-physical systems. Both of these standards contribute to removing TBT in several ways.\nISO/IEC 27001: safeguarding information security\nISO/IEC 27001 is a globally recognized standard that sets the guidelines for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It provides guidance on systematically identifying, managing and mitigating information security risks. \nISO/IEC 27001 provides a comprehensive framework for protecting sensitive information, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. It helps remove TBT in several ways, especially when combined with conformity assessment.\nFirstly, ISO/IEC 27001 provides a set of requirements that align with various legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. By complying with these requirements, organizations can demonstrate conformity with internationally recognized security standards. \nAnd compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 helps remove barriers arising from differing security expectations between trading partners.\nSecondly, ISO/IEC 27001 emphasizes a risk-based approach to information security. Effective risk management reduces the chances of disruptions in trade due to cyber threats, ensuring a more stable and secure trading environment.\nFinally, IEC conformity assessment provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate for organizations that have demonstrated compliance. This builds trust and confidence in their ability to protect sensitive data, thereby removing barriers and facilitating smoother trade relationships.\nIEC 62443: protecting critical infrastructure\nIEC 62443 is a series of international standards specifically designed for the cyber security of industrial automation and control systems (IACS). It provides guidelines for implementing robust security measures in sectors such as manufacturing, energy and transport. \nIEC 62443 helps remove technical barriers to trade by establishing consistent cyber security standards. It provides guidance on securing the supply chain and provides a risk-based approach to industrial cyber security.\nIn industries where equipment and technologies are often sourced from multiple countries, varying cyber security practices can impede interoperability and hinder trade. IEC 62443 establishes consistent security standards for IACS components and systems. \nIEC 62443 addresses security considerations throughout the supply chain of industrial products. It provides guidelines for secure development practices, secure configuration and secure deployment of IACS components. \nA secure supply chain reduces the risk of compromised or counterfeit products. This helps to ensure the integrity and reliability of goods traded between countries.\nLastly, IEC 62443 emphasizes a risk-based approach to industrial cyber security to support business continuity and avoid disruptions to trade operations. It describes a proactive risk management that helps to promote stability and trust in industrial sectors.\nConformity assessment: building confidence\nIEC conformity assessment verifies that standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems. To this end, the IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme tests and provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nIEC conformity assessment for both ISO/IEC 27001 and IEC 62443 offered plays a crucial role in achieving the goal of removing technical barriers to trade. Through conformity assessment, organizations can demonstrate their compliance with internationally recognized cybersecurity standards, providing assurance to trading partners and regulatory bodies. \nIEC conformity assessment for ISO/IEC 27001 and IEC 62443 helps organizations to strengthen their cyber security practices, fosters trust among trading partners, facilitates market access and contributes to the seamless flow of goods and services in the global marketplace."

        "link": "https://www.iec.ch/blog/regulatory-stakes-rise-ev-batteries",
        "published_day": "2023-05-10",
        "abstract": "The production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries is being boosted by extra funding and support.",
        "content": "Under the Inflation Reduction Act,  the US Treasury Department is planning new electric vehicle (EV) tax rules, requiring automakers to source a certain percentage of critical minerals for EV batteries from the United States or a US free-trade partner to qualify for new US federal incentives.\nThis is prompting companies to invest in EV battery production inside the US.  A recent example is South Korea`s recent announcement to pledge USD 5,32 billion in financial support for its battery makers seeking to invest in infrastructure in North America over the next five years. Government support will include lowering lending rates and insurance premiums as well as providing more loans and tax credits for Korean firms' battery and material production facilities in the region.\nBut countries are also vying to support a home-grown industry. In November 2022, South Korea launched the government-backed battery alliance to facilitate the sourcing of key metals in a bid to support the country’s battery industry. South Korea is home to some of the major EV battery makers and is seeking to bolster supply chain stability and metals to become a major player in the field, which is currently dominated by China.\nSimilar moves have taken place in Europe. The European Commission launched the European Battery Alliance in October 2017  to try to establish a complete domestic battery value chain which it says “is imperative for a clean energy transition and a competitive industry.” The European Green Industrial Act’s proposals, made on 1 February  2023,  are viewed by some as a response to the US Inflation Reduction Act. It is a Green Deal Industrial Plan to enhance the competitiveness of Europe's net-zero industry and support the fast transition to climate neutrality. The Plan aims to provide a more supportive environment for the scaling up of the EU's manufacturing capacity for the net-zero technologies and products required to meet Europe's ambitious climate targets, including EV batteries.\nThe Plan builds on previous initiatives and relies on the strengths of the EU Single Market, complementing ongoing efforts under the European Green Deal and REPowerEU. It is based on four pillars: a predictable and simplified regulatory environment, speeding up access to finance, enhancing skills, and open trade for resilient supply chains.\nThe critical role of international standards and conformity assessment\nProviding a supportive environment for EV and battery manufacturers is a key focus for the IEC. Together with ISO, the organization publishes some of the main performance and safety standards for EV batteries. These include the IEC 62660  series on secondary lithium-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs.\nThe IEC 62196 series specify the requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets to interface between the EV and the EV charging system\nOne of the IEC four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems, IECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) has also launched a specific programme for EVs through its registered certification body testing laboratories (CBTLs) and national certification bodies (NCBs). They can test and certify charging systems and stations and plugs against IEC Standards.\nIEC GIF inaugural project focuses on battery circularity in Africa\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund (GIF) aims to ensure that technology has a positive effect on society, the economy and the environment, including through the use of international standards and conformity assessment schemes. It is a public-private platform that enables like-minded stakeholders to convene and develop projects that support areas such as energy access, storage and services. \nThe inaugural project of the GIF – entitled ‘Catalyzing innovation for circular models in Africa – turning battery e-waste into e-resources’ will soon move to implementation stage with the aim to inform the IEC and its wider community on which catalytic interventions can be replicated and scaled up to maximize impact.\n“Technology is advancing at a rate never previously seen, while communities across the world that are on the frontline of the climate crisis often lack basic access to important technologies and services. Standards and conformity assessment facilitate the interconnection, integration and interoperability of technologies as well as ensuring their safety and efficiency. This can help provide the right kind of environment to create markets and scale up investments in green infrastructure. Alongside our partners, the IEC, through the GIF, is helping to redress some of this imbalance,” explains Matthew Doherty, Global Impact Fund Senior Advisor and Officer."

He was an industry expert, with a diverse knowledge spanning lighting, ICT, electrical and electronics manufacturing. \nHe was an active participant in standards development, contributing on key issues affecting the lighting industry. \nRichard Schomberg, the Chair of the IEC Systems Committee on Smart Energy, said: “Kim always impressed me by his listening capability to tirelessly seek and build consensus in the global interest of the IEC family. On top of that he was a very kind, good and reliable person.” \nNadine Bravais, the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 23 said, “Kim was a great professional, knowing well technical matters and being straightforward. He has always fostered fair and open discussions leading to durable compromises.” \nRalph Sporer, former SMB Chair and head of strategic group on Digital transformation and systems approach, said “It was my immense pleasure to have the opportunity to meet and work with Kim for several years on SMB. He was amongst the most respectful and friendly persons I met in IEC and he is a role model for international collaboration, trust and consensus. My sympathy for his family.”\nBeatriz Novel, Chair of IEC Systems Committee 23E, said “Kim has been a role model for me.  I had the pleasure and honour to work with Kim in SEG 9 for three years. In addition to his deep technical knowledge, he was patient, excellent communicator and listener, empathic and optimistic. The best Chair and proud Aussie. I will always remember his kindness and good mood; we could go from a technical discussion to a conversation about children's clothing. He was a wonderful person and will be missed. Rest in peace.”\nKim's dedication to IEC work was an example for many people in the standardization community. The IEC extends its deepest condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time."

The masterclass on IEC 62368-1:2018 provides an overview of the standard and its legacy, its basic principles and areas of application.\nThe international standard, IEC 62368-1, takes a hazard-based approach to the safety of electrical and electronic devices. It also makes it easier to introduce new technologies to the marketplace.\nIntroducing IEC 62368-1:2018\nIEC 62368-1 is applicable to the safety of electrical and electronic equipment within the field of audio, video, information and communication technology, and business and office machines with a rated voltage not exceeding 600 V. It does not include requirements for performance or functional characteristics of the equipment.\nThe standard’s focus on energy safety gives manufacturers greater freedom to explore hardware technologies and will have a major impact on the design of new products. The main hazards are electric shock; electrically-caused fire; hazardous substances (chemical exposure); mechanical (stability, sharp edges, moving parts); thermal burns (hot surfaces); and radiation (laser, ionizing, acoustic).\nIEC 62368-1 clearly identifies potentially hazardous energy sources in order to put safeguards into place. It defines a safeguard as a device or scheme or system that either is interposed between a hazardous energy source and a body part, or that prevents hazardous energy from transferring to or from a body part.\nIEC 62368-1 is the work of IEC Technical Committee 108, which was set up with the responsibility of developing safety Standards for electronic devices in the areas of audio/video, and ICT. It merged the work areas covered by TC 92 (audio/video and electronic equipment for household use) and TC 74 (data processing equipment).\nAbout the masterclass\nThe IEC Academy Masterclass supports professionals involved in standardization to help expand their knowledge of specific IEC International Standards. Professionals involved in industry, regulation and academia can benefit from this Masterclass and receive a holistic overview of specific standards, including essential definitions and implementation use cases.\nThe masterclass on IEC 62368-1:2018 provides an overview of the standard and its legacy, its basic principles and areas of application. Participants will have the opportunity to connect directly with the IEC experts who developed the standard and ask questions in real time.\nThe Masterclass will cover three central topics:\n\nScope and structure of the standard\nHazard-based safety engineering principles and energy sources\nHazards and safeguards\n\nThe masterclass will take place on 30 May 2023 and will be fully virtual.

        "content": "The IEC Academy will be launching a new online learning module targeted at standard developers to help experts understand how to develop gender responsive standards (GRS), using the guidance document published by IEC and ISO. The new module will be launched during a webinar which will take place in May.\nThe guidance document, which is a joint publication produced by the ISO/IEC joint advisory group (JSAG) on GRS, aims to provide standards developers and all technical committee (TC, SC, PC, SyC) and working group (WG) participants with important considerations and questions to aid them in ensuring the standards they are developing are gender responsive. \n“Given the breadth and depth of standardization, there is no singular solution to ensuring that a standard is gender responsive. As such, this guidance is intended to be the first in a series of joint ISO-IEC communications, training and technical policy products on GRS,\" the document explains in the introduction.\nThe module is precisely one of the training products mentioned – other products will follow, including other webinars and training courses.\nPart of the module explains what GRS are and why they are necessary. It defines GRS as standards that reflect an understanding of the physical differences between men and women as well as the different gender roles, and equally addresses the different needs of women and men. It gives examples of these differences and how data can help. It also gives a step- by-step process to follow to assess right from the start the gender differences in a new standard.\n“It has been a real pleasure for me to join the JSAG on GRS and help develop this new online learning module. It should help all our standards developers ensure appropriate gender related conversations are happening during the standards development process. Combined with other initiatives, we can be better positioned to ensure standards work for all and the IEC can meet its obligations and Strategic Plan aspirations,” says Ian Gardner, Head of IEC Academy and Capacity Building."

        "abstract": "ISO/IEC 19566-4 specifies various privacy and security features in JPEG files, such as access control, digital signatures, encryption and watermarking.",
        "content": "JPEG files account for a very large part of the more than 1.8 trillion photos taken worldwide every year. Many of these photos are shared online and as the number continues to grow, so too do concerns about privacy and security.\nOne of the key challenges with sharing photos online is the potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII). For example, images taken on smartphones may include geolocation data, which can be used to track a person's movements. \nImages shared on social media and websites may contain names, addresses and other identifying details that could be used in a range of harmful ways, such as stalking or identity theft. That is why the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) classifies any image that clearly shows the face of a living person as PII. \nTo address these concerns, the international standard ISO/IEC 19566-4 defines a signalling syntax that specifies various privacy and security features in JPEG files, such as access control, digital signatures and watermarking. A signalling syntax is a set of rules and conventions used to communicate privacy and security features\nThese features can be signalled using standardized tags and values, which can be read and interpreted by software and devices that support the standard. They include encryption, which is a powerful tool for protecting sensitive information, as it ensures that data can only be accessed by authorized parties. \nAnother important aspect of ISO/IEC 19566-4 is the ability to signal associated access policies. Access policies can be used to control who is able to view or share JPEG-based image content and metadata. \nFor example, they could be used to limit access to certain images based on the location of the viewer or to restrict the sharing of images that contain sensitive information.\nISO/IEC 19566-4 is part of the ISO/IEC 19566 series of standards that specify various aspects of JPEG systems. JPEG systems are methods for compressing, storing and transmitting digital images and related media.\nTopics covered by other publications in the ISO/IEC 19566 series include:\n\nJPEG Systems architecture — \nISO/IEC TR 19566-1: Part 1: Packaging of information using codestreams and file formats\nJPEG delivery and distribution — \nISO/IEC TR 19566-2: Part 2: Transport mechanisms and packaging\nJPEG metadata — \nISO/IEC 19566-5: Part 5: JPEG universal metadata box format (JUMBF) \nStoring and transmitting 360° images — \nISO/IEC 19566-6: Part 6: JPEG 360\nLinking multiple media elements — \nISO/IEC 19566-7: Part 7: JPEG linked media format (JLINK)\nShort-form image-rich content creation and sharing — \nISO/IEC 19566-8: Part 8: JPEG Snack\n\nThe publications in the ISO/IEC 19566 series are developed and maintained by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1. This is the working group on the coding of still pictures within the subcommittee on the coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information of the joint IEC and ISO technical committee on information technology.\nSC 29/WG 1 publications are for developers, researchers, educators, students and professionals who work with digital images and want to understand the principles and methods of JPEG compression."

        "published_day": "2023-04-26",
        "abstract": "Larger freight vehicles are more likely to be powered by fuel cells than smaller individual cars.",
        "content": "Like electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen vehicles emit no air pollution from the exhaust. Instead of being powered by electricity stored in a battery, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) produce the electricity on board through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell stack. Refuelling hydrogen tanks from a pump takes less than five minutes and the range of FCEVs tend to be greater than that of EVs.\nThere are several barriers to market for FCEVs to overcome, however, if they are to compete with EVs. The cost of the fuel cell alone makes the price of a standard passenger car double that of a comparable EV.\nAnother challenge for hydrogen vehicles is the need to compress the gas to very high pressures in order to get the right density of fuel on board to give you range, explains Brendan Bilton, CTO at a UK-based hydrogen refuelling station operator. “In passenger cars that’s a hell of a challenge. It’s why a lot of car manufacturers are moving to SUV models where there’s more room to package the tanks.”\nAnother obstacle is the lack of refuelling infrastructure. There are only around 230 H2 filling stations across the EU and the UK, most of them in Germany. The Clean Energy Partnership, an alliance of German vehicle manufacturers and filling station operators, has pledged to expand Germany’s hydrogen fuelling station network from 100 to 400 stations by 2025 when it will still be a fraction of the country’s 14500 conventional fuel outlets.\n“We have a chicken and egg problem with hydrogen fuel cell technology,” explained Axel Rücker, Program Manager Hydrogen Fuel Cell at the German automotive group. “As long as the network of refuelling stations for hydrogen-powered cars is so sparse, the low demand from customers will not allow for profitable mass production of fuel cell vehicles. And as long as there are hardly any hydrogen cars on the roads, the operators will only hesitantly expand their refuelling station network.”\nTrucks could be the answer\nThe equation makes more sense for road freight. As major truck makers commit to phasing out diesel by 2040, the greater range and speed of refuelling hydrogen vehicles is an attractive alternative for the road transport industry which often operates long distances round the clock.\n“Bigger vehicles pulling heavy loads or with a refrigeration unit or onboard crane for lifting goods becomes a massive challenge for the power capacity of electric batteries. If haulage firms were to switch to EV trucks they would have to completely change their operating model. Hydrogen becomes the only viable zero emission fuel for that sector,” says Bilton.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "published_day": "2023-04-25",
        "abstract": "A new report suggests the industrial metaverse can increase efficiency and achieve sustainability goals. The report says standardization will play an important role.",
        "content": "The industrial metaverse will empower industries to solve extraordinarily complex real-world problems digitally. That is according to a new report from the MIT Technology Review and Siemens. \nThe emergent industrial metaverse explores the potential impacts on business and society, as well as the challenges ahead and innovative use cases that will shape the future. It highlights the essential role of standards to foster interoperability and facilitate the entry of SMEs by enabling the development of less expensive solutions.  \nAt the core of the industrial metaverse are digital twins, which simulate real-world objects in detail. According to the report, the next generation of digital twins will be photorealistic, physics-based, AI-enabled and linked in metaverse ecosystems. \nDigital twins based in the metaverse will enable organizations to model, prototype and test designs before committing physical and human resources to a project. This will usher in a new era of solving real-world problems digitally.\nThe report says that the resource efficiencies enabled by industrial metaverse solutions may increase business competitiveness while also continually driving progress towards sustainability, resilience and decarbonization goals. It also suggests that everyday life will be radically changed, with the industrial metaverse helping to solve \"real problems\". \nThe key capabilities and ecosystems that will enable the metaverse to achieve these benefits are still emerging. These include connectivity, computational power, the trustworthiness of digital twin technology, interoperability, privacy and security. \nMarketplaces, payment systems and regulatory frameworks for metaverse tools and applications will have to be designed and built. The report argues that partnerships will be essential to bringing the industrial metaverse to life.\nThese are all areas where standardization can help. International standards already exist to ensure the trustworthiness and safety of the specific technologies used in the metaverse. \nThese include, for example, artificial intelligence, digital twin, haptic technology, holography, the Internet of Things and VR, among others.\nWhat we do not have yet are global standards that systematically address the metaverse as a whole. For this reason, the IEC Standardization Management Board has created a Systems Evaluation Group (SEG 15) to explore the needs of the metaverse.\nSEG 15 will develop a common understanding and definition of the metaverse, investigate the need for standardization and provide recommendations for an initial roadmap. It will engage with technical committees in IEC, as well as ISO and all other relevant organizations.\nThe industrial metaverse represents an exciting new frontier for innovation and collaboration in industries across the globe. As the new report highlights, international standards can help to ensure that it delivers benefits ranging from improved efficiency to greater sustainability."

        "content": "Four mentoring agreements have been established within the framework of the revamped IEC Mentoring Programme for 2023-2024. The mentors are Austria, France, Saudi Arabia and the USA while their respective mentees are Zambia, Senegal, the State of Palestine and Colombia.\nThe IEC Mentoring Programme forges partnerships either between IEC Members or between IEC Members and affiliate countries. The programme seeks to leverage the experience and knowledge of IEC National Committees to benefit the IEC community. The programme provides a solid foundation for countries to strengthen their participation in international standardization and conformity assessment activities.\nThe IEC Mentoring Programme was recently updated to help increase the engagement and commitment of participants. The programme is now taking place over the course of one year and focuses on achieving up to three clearly defined projects. \nThe first IEC Mentoring Programme partnership was established in 2013. Since then, there have been over 20 partnerships.\n \n\nTimeline\nPrior to submitting applications, mentees must complete the IEC Mentoring Programme online course to ensure a full understanding of the IEC standardization, conformity assessment and an additional item of the Terms and Conditions for the Affiliate countries. They then submit their applications to the programme with their defined projects before the end of February.\nThis is followed by a matchmaking month when mentors and mentees are paired. The current partnerships will last from 1 May 2023 until 30 April 2024.\nPartnerships can be extended up to six months if ongoing work remains unfinished.\n \nFocusing on projects\nSome outstanding projects are on the horizon for the 2023-2024 mentoring edition, such as:\n\nEnhancing the effectiveness of the National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) in terms of its status, financial strategy and stability\nIncreasing stakeholder engagement, partly for more participation of experts in standardization activities/work\nIncreasing the knowledge regarding the implementation of IEC Conformity Assessment schemes\nImplicating the next generation’s talent through the Young Professional Programme\nand much more.\n\nBy focusing on specific topics with clearly defined objectives, it is possible to measure the outcome and success of the project. It also enables the IEC Secretariat to personalize the partnership based on the mentee's needs. \nApplicants must define what they would like to achieve, while the IEC Mentoring Programme team, together with the IEC Regional Directors, help to find the right support. \nFor each project, participants are asked to complete a report. These reports serve as a basis for measuring the success of the projects and will be shared with IEC General Assembly by the IEC Secretary-General & CEO.\n \n\nResources available\nA number of resources are available to learn more about the IEC Mentoring Programme.

        "content": "Earth Day takes place every year on April 22 to raise awareness of environmental issues and promote sustainability. The theme for Earth Day 2023, \"Invest in our planet,\" is intended as a rallying cry to governments, businesses and individuals to build a greener, cleaner and more equitable future. \nThis year's event comes after the release of the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which confirms that we are still far from addressing the impacts of global warming. Here are some ways that IEC Standards and conformity assessment can play an important role. \nMitigation\nAs natural disasters become more frequent and intense, they can have a devastating impact on cities and the many services that rely on electricity. To ensure the continued supply of electricity during a disaster, cities need to develop an action plan. \nIEC 63152 outlines the basic concepts of how multiple city services can cooperate to maintain the supply of electricity. IEC 63152-2 defines what to consider when implementing a city service continuity plan.\nMicrogrids can help complement the conventional power grid when demand is high and maintain supply during a grid outage. They can also help remote communities gain access to a more reliable supply of sustainable electricity. \nIEC Technical Committee 8 publishes several documents that specify the design and management of microgrids. These include IEC TS 62898-2, for example, which supplies technical specifications for the operation of microgrids.\nRenewable energy\nIEC TC 57 is responsible for the IEC 61850 series, which are core standards relating to the smart grid,  including the integration of renewable energies and distributed energy resources within the existing electrical network.\nSeveral IEC technical committees develop international standards for renewable energy systems. These include IEC TC 5 for steam turbines, IEC TC 82 for solar photovoltaic energy systems, IEC TC 88 for wind energy generation systems, IEC TC 114 for marine energy and IEC TC 117 for solar thermal electric plants. \nCertification of renewable energy equipment is also crucial to ensure that products, systems and devices are safe, efficient, and reliable. IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\nIECRE's fundamental strategic pillar is to enable sustainable electricity generation and supply. It is the internationally accepted CA system for all power plants producing, storing or converting energy from solar PV, wind and various forms of marine energy.  \nTransport\n\nIEC TCs are paving the way for greener forms of transport, whether for trains, ships, aviation or road-based vehicles. For instance, IEC TC 18 focuses on electrical installations of ships and mobile and fixed offshore units. \nIEC SC 23H concentrates on plugs, socket outlets and couplers for industrial and similar applications and for electric vehicles; IEC TC 69 deals with electrical power/energy transfer systems for electrically propelled road vehicles and industrial trucks. \nConformity assessment\nIEC TC 111 has developed IEC 62430 for environmentally conscious design, including principles, requirements and guidance. The goal of eco-design in the electrotechnical sector is to create products that are both functional and environmentally responsible.\nIECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, tests and provides certification to IEC 62430, as part of its approved process (AP) scheme. This helps to provide international confidence that the products and services of organizations holding IECQ Certification are designed in accordance with the ECD principles of IEC 62430.\nConformity assessment provides essential services to counter greenwashing by measuring and verifying the environmental claims of organizations. IECQ HSPM takes a management systems approach to implementing and maintaining hazardous substance-free products and production processes.\n \nRead more\nTech is key in the fight against climate change, says IPCC report"

The IEA blames the combined influence of trade issues and grid connection backlogs for the result.\nSome emerging countries showed fantastic growth rates, India, for instance, having installed 18,1 GW, predominantly in centralized systems, bringing its PV penetration to nearly 10%.\nIEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems\nIEC publishes international standards for PV systems that convert solar energy into electricity, including for all the elements in the entire PV energy chain. It issues a series of technical specifications (TS) which make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. The standards series has been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). Such standards also serve as the basis for testing and certification of components, devices, and systems.\nTwo of the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems deal with PV parts, systems and installations. IECEE (the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) runs a programme which offers access to qualified testing laboratories for the certification of PV components and modules in accordance with the relevant IEC Standards.\nIECRE is the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications. Its fundamental strategic pillar is to enable sustainable electricity generation and supply. It is the internationally accepted CA system for all power plants producing, storing or converting energy from solar PV, wind and various forms of marine energy."

        "content": "The boundaries between IT and OT (operational technology) are becoming increasingly blurred as industrial systems become more interconnected and digital. It is essential therefore to consider the cyber security risks associated with both OT and IT systems and to implement the right measures to protect them.\nThe effects of cyber-attacks on IT are generally economic. The consequences of a successful cyber-attack on OT systems can be much more severe, as they control the critical infrastructure that our society relies on.  \n Understanding OT\nOT refers to the hardware and software systems that are used to control and monitor physical processes in industries such as manufacturing, energy, transport and utilities. Examples of OT systems include: \n\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems used in power plants to monitor and control the flow of electricity\nbuilding automation systems used to control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings.\nindustrial control systems (ICS) used to control manufacturing processes and assembly lines in factories\ntransport systems, such as traffic control systems used to manage the flow of vehicles on motorways and city streets.\n\nCyber security\nIT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.  Information security management systems, such as the one described in ISO/IEC 27001, are designed to protect sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or credit card numbers, for example\nOT systems have different needs because they have unique characteristics that differentiate them from traditional IT systems. For example, OT systems often have a long lifecycle, which means that they may not be updated or replaced as frequently as IT systems. \nThey also have different performance requirements and are designed to operate in harsh environments. Understanding these characteristics is critical to developing an effective cyber security strategy for OT systems.\nThe IEC 62443 series of standards defines a comprehensive framework for implementing cybersecurity measures in OT environments, covering the entire lifecycle of OT components, from design and development to installation, operation, and maintenance. The standards provide guidance on a range of cyber security issues, including risk assessment, security policies and procedures, network segmentation, access control, incident response and system monitoring.\nIEC 62443 takes a risk-based approach to cyber security, which is based on the concept that it is neither efficient nor sustainable to try to protect all assets in equal measure. Instead, users must identify which systems are critical in terms of ensuring continuity and identify vulnerabilities.\nConformity assessment\nIn addition, IEC conformity assessment provides additional assurance by verifying that standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems. To this end, the IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme tests and provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nBoth IEC 62443 and the IECEE programme help to protect critical infrastructure. In this way, they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16, which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies."

        "abstract": "IEC Standards are essential to enable the global access of electric vehicles (EVs) to charging stations.",
        "content": "Read more in e-tech\nThe widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as one of the main ways to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. Figures show that EV adoption has increased rapidly over the last couple of years: according to EVvolumes, which supplies a data bank of EV sales, a total of 10,5 million new EVs were delivered during 2022, a rise of 55% compared to 2021.\nOne of the reasons many drivers are still hesitant to switch to EVs, however, is because of range anxiety: they worry about whether they'll be able to charge their cars when they're out on the road and thus be able to reach their destination. This is not only a matter of perception: according to many experts the deployment of the charging infrastructure is not ambitious enough to meet the various targets set in developed countries, let alone in emerging economies.\nEnabling seamless travel across Europe\nThe European Green Deal announced in December 2019 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 90% by 2050 compared with 1990. The deployment of a global EV charging infrastructure in line with consumer and business adoption of EVs is viewed a key enabler of the switch to a largely zero-emission vehicle fleet by 2050. The initial target is to reach 1 million charging points by 2025.\nThe Green Deal also refers to an estimated 13 million zero- and low-emission vehicles on European roads by 2025. The ultimate policy objective is to make EV charging as easy as filling a conventional vehicle tank, so that EVs can travel without difficulty right across the EU. One of the ways of making that happen is to encourage the same or at least an interoperable charging infrastructure across the continent – which is where IEC Standards are already playing a key role.\nThe EU common charging standards, or Combined Charging System (CCS), which have been promoted by the European Commission, are EN 62196‑2 for alternative current (AC) and EN 62196-3 for direct current (DC), based on the IEC 62196 series of standards, which cover the mechanical, electrical and performance requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors and vehicle inlets for the connection between the EV supply equipment and the electric vehicle.\nThanks to these standards, users are gradually gaining more harmonized access to different charging networks across the continent. The IEC 61851 Standards specify the DC and AC charging infrastructures and go hand in hand with IEC 62196 series.\nHowever, while international standards are a key factor to facilitate the adoption of EVs, more charging stations need to be deployed in the different European countries, especially in the eastern part of the continent. EU funding is available through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), but one of the problems remains the high cost of charging installations.\n... across the US\nIn the US, SAE J1772, also known as a J plug or Type 1 connector, based on the IEC International Standard, IEC 62196, is the main North American standard for electrical connectors for EVs maintained by SAE International under the formal title SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler.\nWhile one of the main manufacturers of EVs in the US, by far the leading maker of electric cars, had developed its own proprietary equipment, its EVs can connect to the J plug. The company provides a charger adapter cable with all the cars it sells enabling them to use charging stations that have the SAE J1772 connector.\n... and across Asia\nIn 2022, nearly 4 million EVs were sold in China.  According to the numbers presented by StockApps.com, 65% of public EV charging stations worldwide are to be found in China, the country boasting 1,1 million charging stations. Of China’s total figure, 677 000 stations are slow-charging ones, using AC, while 470 000 are fast-charging stations, using DC electricity. Other countries across Asia are setting up national EV policies to accelerate EV adoption with the involvement of most of the main players, such as charging operators, energy companies, EV equipment companies, start-ups and automotive companies.\nSouth Korea, for example, has 106 701 public charging stations, including 15 067 with a fast-charging capability (DC). Most of Asia has adopted the SAE J1772 standard. There are two notable exceptions: Japan where manufacturers have developed equipment based on the CHAdeMO standard for DC charging. It was produced in 2010 by the CHAdeMO Association, formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and five major Japanese automakers. The original design was first published in the Japanese standard JEVS G105-1993. It is compatible with IEC 62196.\n“62196-3 covers three different types of accessories and one of those is based on the CHAdeMO standard. The safety of the charging system is specified in IEC 61851-23,” explains Giacomo Scainelli who convenes the working group which produces the IEC 62196 Standards. The other exception is China which uses  the GB/T charging standard for electric vehicle AC and DC fast charging. \"In 62196-3, Chinese accessories for DC are covered,\" adds Giacomo Scainelli.\nThis is an edited version of an article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "ISO/IEC 29128-1 can help ensure that cryptographic protocols meet their intended security requirements and are free of vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by hackers.",
        "content": "Cryptographic protocols are sets of rules and procedures used to secure communication between two or more parties. They rely on mathematical algorithms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted. \nThe inherent complexity of cryptographic protocols means that designing them to achieve the desired functional and security requirements can be challenging. Many cryptographic protocols simply fail to attain their stated security goals. \nThis means that protocols must be rigorously analyzed in order to find errors in their design. A newly updated international standard, ISO/IEC 29128-1, can help ensure that protocols meet their intended security requirements and are free of vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by hackers.\nISO/IEC 29128-1 proposes a clearly defined verification framework based on scientific methods. It adopts a procedure that already exists for cryptographic algorithms. \nISO/IEC 29128-1 is based on state-of-the-art protocol modelling techniques using mathematics and computer science. The aim of the procedure is to confirm, through the provision of objective evidence, that the security requirements have been fulfilled. \nIt should be noted, however, that the verification process is not a guarantee of security, it is only a confirmation that the security requirements have been fulfilled. \nISO/IEC 29128-1 begins by outlining the methods for modelling cryptographic protocols and the verification requirements, including the methods and tools. It also discusses the differences between bounded and unbounded verification. \nThe cryptographic protocol model section describes the model and its formal specification, the adversarial model and the submission process. It includes a discussion of security properties and self-assessment evidence.\nThe verification process section outlines the general process, including the duties of the submitter and the evaluator. The duties of the evaluator are further divided into main duties, evaluating the prover, evaluating the model and evaluating the evidence. The standard also provides an example evaluation.\nThe informative annexes provide additional information on specific topics related to the standard. Annex A discusses the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe public key protocol, while Annex B provides an example submission.\nAnnex C gives an example evaluation, Annex D looks at the Dolev-Yao model and Annex E discusses security properties.\nThe newly updated standard is the work of the joint IEC and ISO technical committee SC 27, which is responsible for developing international management and technical standards for information security and privacy protection and related topics. The scope of SC 27 includes developing standards for the security and privacy protection of systems, information technologies, processes and services.\nSC 27's portfolio includes standards covering cloud computing services, mobile devices, telecom systems, industrial control systems, AI and IoT. Some of the well-known standards developed by SC 27 include ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002.\nThe work of SC 27 is critical in helping to ensure the security and privacy of information in our increasingly interconnected and digital world."

Although biometric systems already play a significant role in our daily lives, they present significant challenges for elderly people.\nA new ISO/IEC Technical Report (TR) highlights how age-related complications can combine with the degradation of physical characteristics to make it difficult sometimes to identify elderly people accurately. Loss of elasticity in the skin, cataracts and strokes are just some of the age-related ailments that can affect biometric authentication.\nISO/IEC TR 20322 looks at the medical, physical and cognitive aspects that are specific to the use of biometrics by elderly people. The report identifies the lack of scientific studies on the subject of elderly people and biometrics as a significant challenge.  \nIn order to make biometric systems more effective and accessible for everyone, it is crucial to design systems that take into account the unique needs and characteristics of elderly people. The report from the joint IEC and ISO committee on biometrics, known as SC 37, describes the current situation, including the key challenges. \nWhile not providing recommended practices and guidelines, the document offers other benefits. According to the authors, these include:\n\noperational support in using biometrics applied to the context of elderly people\nenhanced acceptance by subjects of systems (elderly people and relatives) using biometric technology\nimproved public perception and understanding of these systems\nsmoother introduction and operation of these systems.\n\nAbove all, the report prepares the ground for the development of international standards on biometrics for elderly people. These future standards can help to ensure that biometric systems are effective, efficient and accessible to all individuals, regardless of age or other demographic factors.\nThe new ISO/IEC Technical Report highlights what is quite literally a growing problem, as life expectancy continues to increase in many countries.  ISO/IEC TR 20322 provides important insights for stakeholders and policymakers as they work to ensure that biometric systems are used in a manner that respects the rights and needs of all individuals, including the elderly. \nSC 37 addresses a wide range of topics related to biometric technology. These include the development of biometric data interchange formats for various modalities such as fingerprints, facial features, iris, signatures and vascular data. \nAdditionally, SC 37 establishes technical interface standards such as APIs, performance and conformance testing methodology standards, biometric application profiles, and biometric sample quality standards. The committee also develops standards to address cross-jurisdictional issues related to the commercial use of biometric technologies."

The three members of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC) alliance say that international standards and conformity assessment can help ensure the responsible and safe development of artificial intelligence.\nAccording to the IEC, ISO and the ITU, international standards can provide appropriate guidelines for responsible, safe and trustworthy AI development. The work of the three standards development organizations helps mitigate many of the risks associated with AI systems and can underpin regulatory frameworks. \nFor example, the ITU's AI for Good initiative, led by the ITU together with 40 partner UN agencies, is helping stakeholders to align AI innovation with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The IEC and ISO develop standards in their joint technical committee, known as SC 42, that cover the entire AI ecosystem, including governance, risk and other management standards, ethical considerations and terminology.\nISO/IEC standards can underpin regulatory frameworks and when adopted, can help ensure that AI systems are robust, secure and trustworthy throughout their entire life cycle. ISO/IEC Standards further increase user confidence by enabling conformance and auditability. \nIn their response to the issues raised by the FLI,  the WSC members highlight the importance of human oversight and accountability and the need for standards to incorporate human rights perspectives. They emphasize that the standardization process involves a broad range of stakeholders, including from industry, academia, government and civil society. \nThey invite FLI members and any other stakeholders who are not already working with them to join in setting international consensus-based standards. Citing the FLI's proposal that no advanced AI system should be released unless it can demonstrate that it does not pose an undue risk, they assert that international standards and conformity assessment can play a crucial role in this process. \nThe IEC, ISO and ITU established the WSC over 20 years ago to strengthen and advance their voluntary consensus-based international standards systems. You can read more about the statement and the WSC here.\nSC 42 organizes bi-annual ISO/IEC AI workshops that target a diverse community of stakeholders interested in AI and the committee's work. These workshops serve to promote the committee's work, scout emerging trends, identify requirements, offer insights, and provide opportunities for future standardization work.\nThe workshops also aim to attract new stakeholders and foster discussion on AI-related issues. The next workshop is scheduled for June 2023."

        "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published new guidance after the FBI warned that more than half of the FDA-approved digital medical devices in the country are at risk of cyber-attacks. The FDA will now require manufacturers to provide evidence that their products are reasonably safe against cyber-attacks and to submit a plan to monitor, identify and address any vulnerabilities.\nMedical devices can be compromised by malicious actors, potentially placing the lives of patients at risk. While there are no reports of direct attacks on medical devices, around half of all hospitals in the US have been targeted with ransomware, which can affect patient care.\nCyber-attacks against healthcare organizations across the world increased by 74% in 2022, according to Check Point Research.\nA 2021 study found that mortality rates increased at a quarter of the hospitals surveyed following a ransomware attack. Data from the CyberPeace Institute suggests that on average a cyber-attack on a health care system leads to 19 days of disruption in patient care. \nIEC develops cyber security standards that can help to ensure the cyber security of medical devices and protect patient safety. For example, IEC TR 60601-4-5:2021 provides detailed guidance on adapting IEC 62443 to the specific needs of the healthcare sector. \nIEC 62443 was originally developed for the industrial process sector but is now used in all cyber physical environments.\nIEC TR 60601-4-5 provides security specifications for medical electrical equipment and systems connected to hospital IT networks. These include the seven foundational requirements set out in IEC TS 62443‑1‑1: identification and authentication control; use control; system integrity; data confidentiality; restricted data flow: timely response to events; and resource availability.\nThe report defines four security levels and the technical capabilities that a device requires to reach a specific level. It specifically references the security level requirements for components of an IT network set out in IEC 62443‑4‑2, which is required reading for anyone using the report.\nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — provides certification to prove compliance to IEC 62443‑4‑2, in addition to IEC 62443-2-4, IEC 62443-3-3, and IEC 62443-4-1.\nAnother key standard included in the report is IEC 80001, which provides guidance on the management of risk related to the use of medical devices in a networked environment. IEC 80001 defines a risk management process that covers the entire lifecycle of a networked medical device, from design and development to decommissioning. \nThe standard focuses on identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with networked medical devices, including cybersecurity threats and failures in communication between devices. \nIEC 80001 is recommended for healthcare organizations and medical device manufacturers that use networked medical devices. It can also help organizations meet regulatory requirements related to medical device safety and security."

The impact of ransomware attacks can be devastating for businesses, with loss of revenue, reputational damage, and legal and regulatory consequences.\nIn response to this growing threat, many organizations are looking to implement robust information security management systems to help prevent or mitigate the impact of these attacks. The most trusted framework is ISO/IEC 27001, a globally recognized standard for information security management. \nImplementing ISO/IEC 27001 provides a systematic approach to information security management. it helps organizations to establish a culture of security and minimize the risk of ransomware attacks.\nISO/IEC 27001 includes a framework of policies, procedures, and controls for managing risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It provides a comprehensive set of controls that can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization and includes a risk management approach that can help organizations identify and prioritize their information security risks. \nISO/IEC 27001 includes both technical and non-technical controls. Technical controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls, help to prevent unauthorized access to networks and data.\nAccording to a report by Informed Sauce, more than 90% of breaches are due to poor patch management. Because it is a critical component of a comprehensive security strategy ISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to establish a robust patch management process to ensure that vulnerabilities associated with missing patches are identified and addressed in a timely manner. \nBut a comprehensive security approach involves not only implementing the right technology and processes but also ensuring that people understand their roles and responsibilities in preventing cyber security incidents. Indeed, employees are often the weakest link in cyber security. \nAccording to Barracuda, 69% of organizations surveyed reported that their ransomware attack started with a malicious email, such as a phishing email designed to steal credentials that would allow attackers to breach the network.\nISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to establish information security policies and procedures, including those related to raising the awareness of employees. This could, for example, include training on how to recognize and avoid phishing emails and other social engineering tactics. \n\nISO/IEC 27001 also advises organizations to review and improve their ISMS regularly to adjust their defences against continuously evolving cyber threats, including ransomware attacks. IECQ conformity assessment can provide added assurance. \nISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate for organizations that have demonstrated compliance.\nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met."

        "abstract": "Stark warning on European wind energy investment.",
        "content": "Europe invested just €17bn in new wind farms in 2022, according to the association for wind energy in Europe, WindEurope, which is the lowest figure since 2009. The investment slumped from €41bn in 2021.\nAccording to WindEurope's latest report, Product Financing and Investment Trends, in 2022 the EU installed 16 gigawatts (GW )and it estimates that the EU will build on average 20 GW of new wind farms over the next five years. WindEurope chief executive Giles Dickson warns: \"The EU needs to build 31 GW of new wind turbines every year to reach its 2030 targets. The EU must urgently restore investor confidence and channel money into its wind energy supply chain if it wants to reach the REPowerEU objectives.\"\nNearly all the financed capacity was for onshore wind farms. France was the only country to finance two small floating offshore wind projects with a total capacity of 60 megawatts (MW). Not a single commercial scale offshore wind farm reached final investment decision in 2022, according to the report. \nAmong the reasons for the slump, inflation resulting from the war in Ukraine prompted central banks to raise interest rates faster than at any\ntime in the last 20 years. This means that borrowing has become more expensive for investors. In addition, supply chain, commodity and logistical costs have risen by up to 50% over the last two years, according to the report. Project developers have delayed financing decisions until the economic outlook improves.\nOn the other hand, the report notes that  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shifted the political landscape towards more renewables. Policymakers see the\nbenefits that renewables bring to energy dependence, in addition to the fight against climate change.\nThis is why the report calls for the EU and European governments  to end the current investment uncertainty caused by unhelpful and uncoordinated national market interventions,  which in some cases can lead to subsidizing fossil fuel investments.\nAccording to the report, The European Green Industrial Act’s proposals, made on 1 February  2023,  are a good first step. The market design proposals send a positive signal to investors and the report calls out to the Council and Parliament to stick to this balanced proposal.\nIEC Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA)\nThe IEC has been leading the way in publishing key safety and performance standards for the wind energy sector, which have enabled the market  to develop at a rapid pace over the last twenty years. Standards and CA Systems have helped industry and regulators overcome uncertainties over the new technology. \nIEC Technical Committee 88 develops standards and specifications for wind turbines, wind power plants onshore and offshore and interaction with the electrical systems to which the energy is supplied. The IEC 61400 Standards are widely used around the world and are essential documents for all those involved in commissioning, designing and maintaining on and off-shore wind farm facilities. Among them, IEC 61400-3-1 outlines the minimum design requirements for fixed offshore wind turbines. IEC TS 61400-3-2 specifies the design of floating wind turbines.\nIECRE (The IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) is the most recent IEC Conformity Assessment  System and is specifically dedicated to renewable energy systems. Its aim is to offer third party assessment for all power plants producing, storing, or converting energy from renewable sources, ensuring that essential quality and safety standards are met.   Wind system manufacturers and suppliers must ensure the performance, reliability and durability of their products. To achieve this, they must consider the materials used to build the turbines, climatic conditions they will be exposed to and the impact of different stresses they will endure over a lifetime. IECRE helps them to achieve these targets, by offering third party testing and certification to the IEC 61400 Standards."

        "content": "A new international standard will help to enhance the security of online transactions, including banking, e-commerce and email. ISO/IEC 29128-1 will benefit all systems and applications that rely on cryptographic protocols. \nCryptography plays a crucial role in keeping transactions safe because it provides a way to secure and protect the information being transmitted over networks. When you send an email or log in to your online banking account, cyber-criminals could potentially intercept the information you're transmitting over the network and use it for fraudulent purposes.\n\nCryptography allows for secure communication by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the information being transmitted. Confidentiality ensures that only the intended recipient can access the information, integrity ensures that the information has not been tampered with or modified during transmission, while authenticity ensures that the sender of the information is verified.\nThe challenge for security specialists is in designing and implementing a cryptographic protocol that meets all of the desired functional and security requirements. A cryptographic protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern the secure communication between two or more parties over a network. \nSuch a protocol defines the methods of encryption, decryption and authentication that allows users to trust the information being transmitted over the network, as well as protect personal identifiable and financial information.\nISO/IEC 29128-1:2023 provides a framework for the verification of cryptographic protocol specifications based on academic and industry best practices. It also proposes a clearly defined verification process based on well-founded scientific methods.\nThe new standard is designed to provide objective evidence that a protocol satisfies its stated security goals. The verification process proposed in the standard is based on state-of-the-art protocol modelling techniques using rigorous logic, mathematics and computer science. \nWhile verification is not a guarantee of security, the process is designed to provide objective evidence that a protocol satisfies its stated security goals. As with any modelling, the results are constrained by the scope and quality of the model and tools used.\nISO/IEC 29128-1 is an essential step in ensuring the security of communication and transactions over networks. It provides a clear and standardized framework for verifying protocol designs in order to help identify and address any design errors or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.  \nThe new standard is the work of the committee on cyber security, known as SC 27, in the joint IEC and ISO technical committee. SC 27 is responsible for developing international standards for information security management systems (ISMS) and related topics.\nThe scope of SC 27 includes the development of publications related to information security management, cyber security and privacy protection. This includes developing standards for the security of specific information technologies and systems, such as cloud computing, mobile devices and industrial control systems.\nSome of the well-known standards developed by SC 27 include ISO/IEC 27001, which provides a framework for the implementation and management of ISMS. The work of SC 27 is critical in helping to ensure the security and privacy of information in our increasingly interconnected and digital world."

        "content": "March 30 is the International Day of Zero Waste. It aims to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns and raise awareness about how zero waste initiatives contribute to the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nE-waste represents a high proportion of global waste and experts estimate that a projected 74,7 million tonnes of electronic and electrical refuse will be reached by 2030 if nothing is done to reduce current rates, which are around 57,4 million tonnes. This is where IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems can play a critically important role.\n\nAn important focus of IEC work is on the circular economy and material efficiency, which is a model of production and consumption that aims to keep materials in use for as long as possible, reduce waste and minimize the use of natural resources.\nThe IEC is preparing a new standard, IEC 63395, which aims to facilitate the systematic, sustainable management of e-waste. Among its objectives, it seeks to reduce the amount of e-waste sent for disposal through reuse and recovery, prevent the inappropriate disposal of e-waste and restrict operators who do not comply with the standard or comparable requirements from receiving e-waste shipments.\nIEC Technical Committee 111, which prepares environmental standards for electrical and electronic products, also issues IEC 62430 which provides guidelines for minimizing the adverse environmental impact of devices throughout their lifecycle. The publication defines environmentally conscious design for all electrical and electronic products, for instance, which materials are used, the quantity of energy consumed to make them, as well as their rate of recyclability.\nIECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, has been leading the way in responding to a market demand for cleaner, greener electronic components and assemblies. Hazardous substances in electronics include, among others, lead, cadmium and mercury. \nSince the early 2000s, IECQ includes a scheme in its portfolio dedicated to the reduction and elimination of hazardous substances:  the IECQ hazardous substances process management scheme (IECQ HSPM).  IECQ HSPM is a technically based management systems approach to implementing and maintaining hazardous substance-free products and production processes. \nIt was developed in response to the need of component manufacturers to give suppliers the means of demonstrating, through third-party assessment, that their electrical and electronic components and assemblies meet specific hazardous substance-free local, national and international requirements.\nMany companies today are working to attain IECQ HSPM certification to IECQ QC 080000, IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components (IECQ System) - Hazardous Substance Process Management (HSPM) System Requirements. The fourth edition, published in May 2017, clarifies how organizations can use IECQ QC 080000 to manage their hazardous substances other than through the outright removal of restricted substances and avoiding their use in products.\nEco-design is part of the answer\nIECQ and TC 111 have also joined strengths on eco-design. The collaboration has focused on the above-mentioned IEC 62430, aimed at organizations intending to integrate environmental aspects into design and development in order to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of their products.\nOn the IECQ side, working group 14: IECQ green approach, was tasked with developing the project together with TC 111. WG 14 was set up to investigate and develop documentation for a green approach within the IECQ schemes and programmes, as well as to play a coordination role for IEC conformity assessment matters and link with IEC TCs in that field. \nNearly three years of a close relationship between IECQ WG 14 and TC 111 experts, has been met with success. IECQ now offers an eco-design service as part of its approved process (AP) scheme."

        "content": "Did you know that the IEC has published over 2 000 Test Report Forms (TRFs) of its standards? These TRF documents showcase the tests performed on a product or component to assess conformity with a standard. They are prepared by a National Certification Body (NCB). \nTRFs are complete and perfectly aligned with IEC and ISO standards. All the required information to document a test or analysis are included in the TRF and its structure matches the relevant IEC or ISO standard. TRFs have been fully verified and endorsed by recognized Test Laboratories and Certification Bodies before public release which means that they are fully validated. \nBenefits of TRFs\nTRFs provide companies with a number of benefits including cost savings, market access and quality-control.\nCost savings\nTRFs create efficiency by helping companies to save time. According to Pierre Selva, Conformity Assessment & Market Surveillance VP at Schneider Electric, \"Buying a TRF helps to save time we do not need to develop our own test reports, allowing us to focus our attention on higher added value topics and our test laboratory engineers are more productive. As time is money, it is fully beneficial to our company.\"\nAccessing international markets\nWhere Certificates are not required, Companies can use TRFs to demonstrate compliance to regulations. Where certificates are required, they can use the IECEE Conformity Assessment system of the IEC, by applying via a National Certification Body. Using a standardized document makes it easier to get acceptance on the international market.\nAs Mr Selva notes, “IEC TRFs are recognized by multiple stakeholders, including our customers and national regulators. The widespread use of IEC TRFs means that our stakeholders are comfortable with the format and can spend their resources on verifying key points rather than trying to find and interpret the relevant data.” \nEnable problem-solving and quality control\nBecause test reports are fully aligned with the structure of the international standard, it makes it easier for companies to identify and solve problems. They can also better control product quality. \nLaboratories can use the test reports to perform and evaluate tests step by step or in an individual sequence. The results can be entered directly into the document, which makes it easier to see which points have already been processed and which need to be completed.\n\"The descriptions used in an IEC TRF are precise and perfectly aligned with the relevant IEC Standards. IEC TRFs are thorough and fully verified and endorsed by multiple recognized test laboratories and National Certification Bodies before their publication. This gives them an important validation,” concludes Mr Selva."

        "published_day": "2023-03-24",
        "abstract": "Technology together with suitable measures are essential to meet climate targets.",
        "content": "The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published on 20 March, highlights the catastrophic impact of human activity on climate change since the industrial revolution in the Western hemisphere, as in reports from previous years. “More than a century of burning fossil fuels as well as unequal and unsustainable energy and land use has led to global warming of 1,1°C above pre-industrial levels. This has resulted in more frequent and more intense extreme weather events that have caused increasingly dangerous impacts on nature and people in every region of the world,” the experts insist.\nThe impacts are multiple and include people dying form extreme heat as well as increased climate-driven food and water insecurity. “Almost half of the world’s population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the IPCC experts and writers of the report.\nMore action needed\nBut not all is doom and gloom. The report also highlights that action can be taken and that the solution to reduce global warming lies in resilient development. “If technology, know-how and suitable policy measures are shared, and adequate finance is made available now, every community can reduce or avoid carbon-intensive consumption. At the same time, with significant investment in adaptation, we can avert rising risks, especially for vulnerable groups and regions,” the IPCC says.\nThe report notes that progress has been made and cites multiple examples of effective adaptation to climate change which include on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry as well as sustainable land management approaches. Urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing flood risks and urban heat. Adaptation options such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have had broad applicability across multiple sectors.\nThe report indicates that in many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions. This includes the deployment of renewable energy systems like solar, wind and hydro and the roll-out of an electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and EVs, together with the promotion of public transportation and cycling in cities.\nBut this is not enough to hit global warming targets set in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Without a strengthening of policies, global warming of 3,2 C is projected by 2100, the report says.\nWhere the IEC can help\nOn disaster mitigation:\nAs natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding occur more frequently and with greater intensity, they can have a devastating impact on cities and the many services that rely upon electricity. Cities need to put in place a plan of action to ensure the continued supply of electricity when a disaster strikes.\nIn 2020, the IEC published IEC 63152 which outlines the basic concepts of how multiple city services can cooperate to maintain the supply of electricity. However, depending on the type of service, the response to a disaster may vary.  For this reason, the IEC has published a new standard to complement the implementation of IEC 63152.\nIEC SRD 63152-2, Smart cities - City service continuity – Implementation guideline and city service cases defines what to consider when designing guidelines for city service continuity. It includes templates and use cases to ensure that service providers address the requirements for a wide range of situations caused by disasters.\nMicrogrids or minigrids can complement the conventional power grid when electricity demand is high but also maintain supply during a grid-outage and restore electricity supply faster. They can also help remote communities gain access to a more reliable supply of sustainable electricity.\nIEC TC 8 publishes several documents which specify the design and management of microgrids. One of its subcommittees, SC 8 B, publishes IEC 62898-2, for instance, which supplies guidelines for the operation of microgrids.\nStandards for renewable energies\nTo this day, the most important source of renewable energy remains hydro power. A key IEC 61850 Standard specifies the role of this much relied upon source of energy and helps it interoperate with the electrical network as it gets digitalized and automated. The standard is part of the IEC 61850 series, which are core standards used for the deployment of smart grids.\nSeveral IEC Technical Committees (TCs) develop international standards for renewable energy systems. They help small and big renewable energy systems to operate safely and efficiently, on-grid or off-grid.\nIn addition to TC 4: Hydraulic turbines, they include:\n\nIEC TC 5: Steam turbines\nIEC TC 82: Solar photovoltaic energy systems\nIEC TC 88: Wind energy generation systems\nIEC TC 114: Marine energy - Wave, tidal and other water current converters\nIEC TC 117: Solar thermal electric plants \n\nCertification of renewable energy equipment, to ensure products, systems and devices are safe, efficient and reliable is a service offered in the IEC by IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\nStandards for sustainable transportation\nA host of IEC TCs are paving the way for greener forms of transport, whether for trains, ships, aviation or road-based vehicles. Read more: https://www.iec.ch/transportation.\nThese include:\nIEC TC 9: Electrical equipment and systems for railways\nIEC TC 18: Electrical installations of ships and of mobile and fixed offshore units\nIEC TC 21: Secondary cells and batteries\nIEC SC 23H: Plugs, Socket-outlets and couplers for industrial and similar applications, and for EVs\nIEC TC 69: Electrical power/energy transfer systems for electrically propelled road vehicles and industrial trucks\nIEC TC 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunications equipment and systems\nIEC TC 97: Electric installations for lighting and beaconing of aerodromes\nIEC TC 105: Fuel cell technologies\nIEC TC 107 : Process management for avionics\nIEC TC 125: Personal e-transporters\nConformity assessment against greenwashing\nIEC Conformity Assessment schemes, such as the ones offered by IECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic System for Electronic Components), provide much needed services to measure and verify companies' environmental claims. They include the hazardous substances process management (HSPM) and the eco design approved process schemes.\nIECQ HSPM is a technically based management systems approach to implementing and maintaining hazardous substance-free products and production processes. IECQ HSPM was developed in response to component manufacturers’ need to give suppliers the means of demonstrating, through third-party assessment, that their electrical and electronic components and assemblies meet specific hazardous substance-free local, national and international requirements.\nRecently, IECQ joined forces with IEC TC 111: Environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems, to offer an eco design service as part of its approved process (AP) scheme. Eco design seeks to minimize negative environmental impacts and promote sustainability throughout a product's life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life management. This includes considering factors such as energy efficiency, resource use, waste reduction, and toxicity. The goal of eco design in the electronics industry is to create products that are both functional and environmentally responsible.\nThe collaboration relies on an international standard developed by TC 111, IEC 62430, Environmentally conscious design (ECD) - Principles, requirements and guidance, aimed at organizations to achieve eco design.\nWith climate change on everyone's mind, the demand for clean and sustainable energy sources is increasing rapidly, and hydrogen, which has been used by industry for decades, is expected to be part of the green energy mix. A new IEC Conformity Assessment scheme ensures it is handled safely.\nAn IECEx (the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres) programme provides the certification of equipment, components and systems, associated with the production, distribution, dispensing and use of hydrogen, including gaseous hydrogen dispensing equipment, components and systems for light and heavy-duty vehicles."

        "content": "In August 2022, a criminal cyber-attack on a UK water company saw hackers gain access to customer banking details. While cyber security threats to the water sector are not new, the digitalization of utilities has increased the risks exponentially.\nThe biggest cyber security hazard facing water companies and all critical infrastructure organizations is the possibility of an attacker taking control of their IT or OT (operational technology) systems to steal data and block or disrupt operations. IEC develops cyber security standards and conformity assessment for both IT and OT. \nCyber-attacks on IT and OT systems often have different consequences. The effects of cyber-attacks on IT are generally economic, while cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure can impact the environment, damage equipment, or even threaten public health and lives. \nThere are three main types of attackers: those who do it for bragging rights, criminals who want to block access to computer systems until a ransom is paid and state-backed attackers trying to gain access to critical infrastructure in what is called cyber-warfare. The latter poses the most significant and under-the-radar threat.\nWhen implementing a cyber security strategy, it is essential to take the different priorities of OT and IT systems into account. IEC provides relevant and specific guidance via two of the world’s best-known cyber security standards: IEC 62443 for OT and ISO/IEC 27001 for IT systems.\nMany of the risks that utilities are facing stem from the continued use of legacy systems, which were installed many years ago. These systems often have minimal, if any, cyber security features and present a significant digital attack surface. \nUtilities must undertake a full assessment of their security systems in order to take the right steps to protect their systems from attacks. Actions may include replacing existing unsecured devices with cyber-secure devices, using firewalls, or segregating IT and OT networks, to ensure any access routes to critical operational networks are blocked to unauthorized users.\nCollaboration between water companies and their supply chain partners is essential to ensure that the whole system is secure. They must use the same, trusted international standards, including:\n\n\nIEC 62443-2 for policies and procedures \n\n\nIEC 62443-3 for requirements at the system level \n\n\nIEC 62443-4 for components and requirements \n\n\nThis is a key concept of IEC 62443 — organizations can provide certified devices, but these devices must be correctly installed and satisfy requirements at the system level. The utilities should then enforce best practices from their employees and other authorized users, as detailed in the standards.\nUnfortunately, it is likely that the scale and complexity of cyber-attacks against the water sector and other utilities will increase in the future. Attackers will always find new ways to penetrate systems.\nThe good news is that the technology to tackle threats is developing at a fast pace and is moving towards being fully automated, driven by artificial intelligence. International standards developers are keeping pace.\nAbove all, though, robust security cannot be achieved through hardware or software alone. As advocated in ISO/IEC 27001 and IEC 62443, achieving resilience requires a holistic strategy that addresses people, policies, products and procedures."

        "content": "A new international standard, IEC 60268-23, specifies acoustical measurement methods for television sets, monitors with built-in loudspeakers and other audio devices with similar acoustical properties, such as flat-panel loudspeakers. This new standard was developed by IEC Technical Committee 100, which is responsible for developing standards for audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment.\nThe new standard provides measurement methods for the audio system of TVs and monitors that take the listening environment into account. This ensures that the sound quality of these devices is consistent, regardless of the installation type and position of the loudspeaker.\nThe new standard was needed because the sound characteristics of TVs and monitors can vary significantly depending on the location and position of the loudspeakers. A lot of TVs  place their speakers at the bottom of the screen, while others are in the middle, side or on the rear of the set.\nSpeakers can also be used on stands or mounted on a wall. Methods used for their installation continue to evolve.\nDue to these variations, it was essential to develop new measurement methods for loudspeakers of TVs and monitors that can take into account the listening environment.\nThe standard applies to acoustical measurements that are performed under free-field conditions and in-situ. It does not assess the perception and cognitive evaluation of the reproduced sound, nor the impact of perceived sound quality.\nIEC 60268-23 complements the existing loudspeaker measurement methods developed by IEC TC 100.\nMost of the world’s audio-video devices rely on the standardization work of TC 100. The committee has published more than 500 standards which shape the audio, video and multimedia landscape.\nOther technical areas that TC 100 deals with include colour measurement and management and multimedia systems and equipment for cars. TC 100’s work ensures that that equipment and systems and are not only of the highest quality but also interoperable, which means that they can be used together seamlessly, regardless of the manufacturer.\nTC 100 also aims to standardize forward looking technology areas like haptics or even the Metaverse. It has recently published a technical report to clarify the conceptual model of haptics in multimedia systems and has set up has set up a group to prepare standards for multimedia equipment relating to the Metaverse."

By collecting data easily and using algorithms to analyze the data in real time, it is possible to formulate an overall picture of what is going on in a given area – and how it can be improved or strengthened.\nHowever, in order for these technologies to work together and process the data, standards are needed. Standardization work is essential to ensure that data can freely circulate between the various systems in a city.\nBecause cities are comprised of interconnected systems that must be addressed holistically, the IEC has set up its Systems Committee for Smart cities. Among its activities, this systems committee develops and maintains a reference architecture model and standards mapping tool for smart cities.

The series provides the methodology for smart city standards inventory and mapping, a database with the standards inventory and guidance on standards inventory and mapping for public health emergencies.\nWhat are the benefits of cataloguing and mapping smart city standards?\nMapping smart city standards helps SDOs, consortia, national standards bodies and city stakeholders to easily find and identify the standards needed for any aspect of smart cities. This could include, for example, standards related to citizen services, city infrastructure, governance, etc.\nStandards mapping also helps to identify gaps in the standardization ecosystem where standards need to be developed. It also supports collaboration between standard developers and standards users.\nCan you tell us more about IEC SRD 63233-1 which has now been published?\nPart 1 of the IEC SRD 63233 series describes a systematic approach to carry out smart city standards analysis based on the IEC systems approach. It defines the steps necessary for standards inventory and mapping.\nWhat is being developed for Part 2 and Part 4 of the IEC SRD 63233 series?\nPart 2 provides a database of smart city standards, including those that already exist or are currently under development. It includes smart city standards from the IEC, ISO, ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU-T, CEN/CENELEC, ETSI, IEEE and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and classifies them based on the methodology defined in Part 1. The database will require continual updates that will be undertaken by IEC SyC Smart cities WG 3.\nPart 4 provides guidance on public health emergencies standards inventory and mapping as per the methodology defined in IEC SRD 63233-1.\nBoth of these parts of IEC SRD 63233 are currently under development, with Part 2 expected to be published later this year and Part 4 in early 2024.\n \nNote: a longer version of this article is available on e-tech."

        "content": "Electricity consumption worldwide has been on a constant rise over the last 50 years, with an estimated usage of about 25,300 terawatt-hours in 2021. During the period between 1980 and 2021, electricity consumption witnessed a more than threefold increase.\nThe surge in industrialization and widespread access to electricity have contributed to the increase in global electricity demand. Modern lifestyles and leisure activities also play a significant role. \nA newly updated ISO/IEC standard addresses the issue of media consumption. Streaming a two-hour movie reportedly pollutes as much as a 45-minute car drive. \nISO/IEC 23001-11:2023 specifies metadata (known as green metadata) that facilitates the reduction of energy usage during media consumption without compromising quality of experience (QoE). \nFor example, the metadata provides information on how to reduce energy usage during media consumption without affecting the quality of the content. The standard specifies several types of metadata that facilitate energy-efficient media consumption. \nThis includes metadata for energy-efficient decoding, encoding, presentation and media selection. The metadata for energy-efficient decoding specifies complexity metrics (CM) metadata and decoding operation reduction request (DOR-Req) metadata. \nThis metadata allows a decoder to vary the operating frequency and reduce decoder power consumption. The remote encoder can also use the DOR-Req metadata to modify the decoding complexity of the bitstream and reduce local decoder power consumption in a point-to-point video-conferencing application.\nThe metadata for energy-efficient encoding specifies quality metrics that a decoder can use to reduce the quality loss from low-power encoding. The new publication specifies RGB-component statistics and quality levels. \nExamples include a presentation subsystem to adjust display parameters based on the statistics to provide a desired quality level from the metadata and reduce power consumption. The metadata for energy-efficient media selection specifies DOR-Req parameters, RGB-component statistics and quality levels. \nIn addition, it allows the client in an adaptive streaming session to determine power-saving characteristics of available video representations and select the representation with the optimal quality for a given power-saving level.\nISO/IEC 23001-11:2023 is an important standard that addresses the need for energy-efficient media consumption. This standard provides a way for content providers to reduce energy consumption during media consumption without compromising the quality of experience. \nThe international standard is developed by the multiple Emmy-winning MPEG group in the joint IEC and ISO technical committee for multimedia."

        "abstract": "Material efficiency is a systemic approach that aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them before they are reused or recycled.",
        "content": "The concept of material efficiency is closely linked to the circular economy, which is an economic model that calls for a radical shift in production and consumption. Material efficiency is about getting the most value out of the materials that we use and reducing waste to achieve a sustainable future. \nIn a linear economy, we take resources and use them to create products. We then dispose of those products when they are no longer useful. \nThis approach is unsustainable as it leads to the depletion of natural resources and the accumulation of waste. In contrast, a circular economy seeks to create a system where resources, which also include waste, are (re-)used efficiently.\nMaterial efficiency is a key component of the circular economy because it enables us to get more value out of the resources we have. It is a systemic approach that aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them before they are recycled or reused. \nBy designing products that use less material or can be easily repaired or remanufactured, we can extend the life cycle of the product. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the product but can also lead to cost savings for businesses. \nOne example of material efficiency in action is the reuse of materials in manufacturing. \nWe can reduce the amount of energy and resources required to create new products by re-using materials instead of virgin materials. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the manufacturing process but also reduces costs for the business.\nAnother example of material efficiency is the use of renewable energy sources in manufacturing. We can reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process, as well as reducing the reliance on finite resources like fossil fuels by using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment can play an important role. The IEC has already developed a number of publications to support material efficiency and the circular economy. Some examples include:\n\nIEC TR 62635 with information on product end-of-life, including the recyclability rate calculation.\nIEC TR 62824 with guidance about material efficiency considerations in the eco-design of products.\nIEC 62309 examines the dependability of products containing used parts.\nIEC 63077 specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment.\n\nIEC 62430 sets requirements and provides guidance on implementing environmentally conscious design (ECD). It covers both physical goods and services, as well as a combination of the two. It applies to any organization, regardless of size, type or sector. \nIECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, tests and provides certification to IEC 62430, as part of its approved process (AP) scheme. \nConformity assessment helps to provide international confidence that the products and services of organizations holding IECQ Certification are designed in accordance with the ECD principles of IEC 62430. In this way, they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12, which is to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.\nLooking forward, additional IEC Standards are under development. For example, TC 62 and TC 2 are developing standards for the refurbishment of medical equipment and rotating machinery, respectively.  \nTC 111 is currently working on a standard for assessing the proportion of reused components in products."

        "content": "In February 2022, the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) became a recognizing National Certification Body (NCB) of the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE). As a recognizing NCB, KEBS operates a national certification approval scheme which recognizes IECEE test reports and certificates for electrical and electronic components, equipment and products.\nKEBS’s involvement within the IEC community as an associate member dates back to February 2005. It joined as an IECEE Member Body in 2008 and has hosted the IEC National Committee of Kenya since 2005.\nIn a recent conversation, Irene Njine, Assistant Manager for the Quality Assurance Department, and Benson Bundi, Principal Inspection Technician for the Quality Inspection Department in KEBS, provided further details about their involvement in IECEE and strengthening their relationship with the IEC.\nKEBS certification marks\nKEBS issues three standardization marks, one of which, Import Standardization Mark of Quality, focuses on imported products. Among the criteria for certification and entering the Kenyan market, products must be tested for conformity to specific safety and performance requirements.\nAccording to Mr Bundi, “Distributors apply to KEBS to be able to have their products sold in Kenya. We then issue certificates for those products registered by KEBS. One of the criteria for registration is the submission of a certificate of conformity as per the IECEE CB Scheme. Once we can confirm through the IECEE database that the certificate is valid, we register the product and allow it to enter our market without further testing.”\nSince its participation as an IECEE NCB in February 2022, KEBS has declared 211 IEC Standards as within their recognizing scope and issued 32 product certificates. “We have declared standards across the 23 IECEE product categories, including batteries, low voltage and high-power switching equipment, installation accessories and connection devices,” notes Ms Njine.\nSatisfying market needs\nMarket reaction to the recognition of the IECEE CB Scheme has been very positive. Mr Bundi remarks, “We have received a lot of positive comments from industry who have benefited from reduced costs in certification and quicker market access. They are able to efficiently and effectively do their business owing to us embracing this certification scheme.”\nPositive market reaction is also evidenced by the increased demand in product registration applications. “We are receiving many applications right now which underscores the importance of the IECEE CB Scheme and the value that distributors place on it. The IECEE CB Scheme is a market tool for KEBS and is now understood to be the easiest way to import high quality goods into the Kenyan market,” explains Mr Bundi.\nA leader in Africa\nIn Africa, only three countries participate in IECEE as member bodies – Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya and South Africa. This can provide KEBS with an opportunity to help neighbouring countries better understand and become involved in conformity assessment activities.\n“Conformity assessment is a recurrent agenda item for the committee meetings I attend on the African continent. We want to help other countries understand the benefits of conformity assessment by preaching this gospel. I tell them that the Kenya Bureau of Standards has been able to go through this process and take the time to help them. We hope to be able to convert them to IECEE,” highlights Ms Njine.\nA longer version of this interview is available on e-tech."

The ultimate goal of the event is to facilitate the further roll-out of smart grids. The week-long programme combines a series of standardization workshops, including case-study presentations, technology innovation panel debates and end-user roundtable discussions.\nAmong the key sessions, Christoph Brunner, who is the Convenor of one the main working groups dealing with substation automation inside the IEC, will kick off  the week with a practical workshop  on the core standards for the smart grid: the IEC 61850 series.\nOn the second and third day, more than 40 utilities will share lessons learnt from recent implementations and their roadmaps for the future. Some will indicate how to support a much faster pace of renewables integration to ensure energy security.\nThe last day will be devoted to smart grid cyber security, showcasing different prevention, detection, and response strategies to cyber threats. Among many other topics, the usability of the IEC 62443 Standards will be looked into.\n“We are delighted to have drawn more than 200 key experts in smart grid technology to take part in our three-track programme of round tables, presentations and discussions during SGTech Week. I can already announce that we will be building on this success next year as we plan to have a six-track programme, adding topics like smart metering and Big Data.

        "content": "Analysts warn that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the cyber security landscape. According to the security firm Darktrace, criminals are using AI chatbots to create more convincing and complex scams that exploit user trust.\nThanks to AI technology, cyber criminals are able to create more targeted and personalized e-mail attacks, making it harder for businesses to defend against attacks. However, organizations can make themselves more resilient by implementing ISO/IEC 27001.\nThe international standard provides a framework, known as an information security management system (ISMS), for managing risks and protecting against cyber threats. \nISO/IEC 27001 recommends a risk-based approach to information security management, which means identifying threats to business-critical assets and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate those risks. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing the human factor in information security, including the risks posed by employees as potential cyber security threats. \nISO/IEC 27001 advises organizations to establish a culture of information security. The aim is to help all employees to understand the importance of protecting information and to ensure that they are actively engaged in maintaining a secure environment. \nThis can be achieved through regular communication and training and awareness programmes, as well as by establishing an information security governance structure that includes senior management. Training should cover not only phishing and other social engineering attacks, but also topics such as password management.\nIn addition, ISO/IEC 27001 recommends that organizations establish clear policies and procedures for managing access to information and information systems. This includes policies for creating and managing user accounts, managing access rights and controlling the use of privileged accounts. \nThe standard also recommends that organizations implement controls to monitor and audit user activity to detect and prevent unauthorized access or use of information.\nProviding added assurance, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nIECQ certification helps to build trust and confidence in the organization's information security practices. This can be particularly important for businesses that are looking to build relationships with customers, suppliers and other partners who need assurance that their information is being protected.\nWhile the use of AI technology by cybercriminals is a concerning trend, consensus-based international standards and conformity assessment offer proven protection. Implementing ISO/IEC 27001 enables organizations of all kinds and sizes to establish a systematic and structured approach to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data."

Only International Standards can help to overcome these barriers.\nLouis Mercier, head of Multilateral Green Trade Policy at the UK's Department of Business and Trade, emphasized that environmental policies can have a mix of positive and negative effects on trade, including added cost, if not designed and  implemented in reference to international standards. This is the case for environmental goods, like wind turbines, one of several case studies illustrating research carried out by the Department.\n\"Trade policy makers, climate policy makers, regulators and standards making bodies need to work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for more sustainable trade,\" he said.\nAlistair Mackinnon explained the role of IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment, notably regarding wind turbines, highlighting the work of Technical Committee 88, which prepares standards for wind energy systems.\n\"The sector has witnessed a sea change over the last 40 years. The renewable energy sector is now a multi-million dollar business and it has become global. A wind turbine can be designed in Denmark, manufactured in China, and deployed on the East or West Coast of America,\" he emphasized.\nHe underlined the openness and the consensus-driven nature of IECRE. \"No stakeholder among our members has more say than another. Everyone is welcomed, valued and respected,\" he stated.\nHe encouraged countries from around the world to join IECRE as members. \"Most of our members come from Europe and the North American continent. Our Asian colleagues also make important contributions, but we would like to see African and South American countries take part as well,\" he said.\nHe recognized that cost, notably for travel, could be a barrier to participation for some countries and called out to the WTO to perhaps find some sort of solution to reduce these barriers.\n\"We are not blessed with the gift of telepathy and can't guess countries' different requirements if they don't take part. I have an example. We have produced various standards for wind turbines over the years but it is only when the Japanese member mentioned that they did not account for typhoon conditions that we included that specific aspect in the standards,\" he concluded.\nFind out more: https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_0703202315_e/tbt_0703202…"

He also touched on India's potential to lead the way in addressing the challenges. \n\nMr Schomberg emphasized the importance of sustainability in all areas of life. He underlined that the demand for energy was increasing rapidly while there was a growing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to the effects of climate change on daily life. \nMr  Schomberg argued that it is not just energy that needs to be addressed for long-term sustainability, but also water, air quality and food. He claimed that customers and citizens had growing expectations of resiliency, lower cost and new services that are cyber secure and respect privacy. \nIt was essential to ensure the universality of sustainability in all areas of life with India projected to become the world’s most populous country by 2050. Mr Schomberg highlighted the role of the Indian government's \"Aatmanirbhar Bharat Plan\" in turning the crisis of the COVID pandemic into an opportunity.\nHe said that global institutions like the IMF and World Bank recognized that the plan was providing the much-needed impetus to economic growth. \nMr Schomberg quoted the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who said that clean energy was the \"ticket to growth and prosperity.\" India has a combined installed capacity of about 175 GW (174.53 GW) of renewable energy sources, including large hydropower, with a potential of over 1000 GW. \nCiting the REN21 Renewables 2022 Global Status Report, he said that India is currently ranked fourth globally in Renewable Energy Installed Capacity (including Large Hydro), fourth in Wind Power capacity, and fourth also in Solar Power capacity. India can also rely on 22 nuclear reactors for resilient carbon-free base load generation.\nThe Indian government is investing a massive 30 billion US dollars in transmission projects to enable the integration of over 500 GW of Renewable Energy Capacity by 2030. He said that this would connect mega solar parks and wind power zones with the national grid, along with installing battery energy storage capacity of 51.5 GW by 2030 to firm up intermittent generation. \nMr Schomberg praised the Indian Prime Minister's initiative of forming the International Solar Alliance as a major step forward in ultimately achieving a world Global Energy Interconnection to fulfil the mission of One Sun, One World, One Grid.\nMr Schomberg emphasized that energy efficiency, demand-side management, controllable loads, electric vehicles and transport could bring a substantial contribution, fully enabled by the deployment of smart metering. He said that the energy choices that India makes will not only have a direct bearing on its growing population but also in interconnected ways affect the global energy market, carbon emissions and the flow of capital.\nMr Schomberg told the audience, which included senior Indian government officials and prominent business people, that international standards were the key to solving the challenges. He said that the IEC was committed to delivering an enabling portfolio of technical standards.\nMr Schomberg chairs the IEC Systems Committee for Smart Energy and is a Lord Kelvin Award laureate."

        "content": "As part of its growing portfolio of products, the IEC has officially launched its standards as extended versions (EXV). With the extended version, users will be able to seamlessly and efficiently consult IEC publications from a single document.\nRecognizing that it may be difficult and time consuming to consult IEC Standards and its references simultaneously, the extended version compiles the key information and content into a single, easy to use document. The extended version includes the relevant clauses from one publication inserted directly into the second publication and highlighted for easy reference.\n“We are very excited to offer IEC publications as extended versions. This will allow users to have an enhanced experience with our standards while also saving precious time,” noted Guilaine Fournet, Head of Sales & Business Development.\nOver 10 IEC Standards were published at the end of 2022 as extended versions. Several manufacturers, interviewed as part of the market research to better understanding user needs, expressed their enthusiasm. Market interest is high.\nAccording to a representative from a leading manufacturing company in Germany, “EXVs help a lot and provide huge benefit. They are easier to read and will be very beneficial for those who are relatively new to standards as it reduces the number of documents to be read simultaneously.”\nAnother manufacturer from Japan agreed. “It is easy to understand the relationships between documents with the EXV rather than existing standards. It will help to save time in reading and understanding publications.”\nThe EXV will also be beneficial to those who are new to standards. New standard users will be able to save time by accessing all of the necessary information from a single document. As notes another manufacturer from Germany, “EXV can target people that are not yet into standardization. The next generation of users would like quick and easy access to information and this could provide the answer.”\nIn 2023, the IEC expects to publish over 60 standards as extended versions. These EXV will primarily be developed from standards in existing series that have been developed by the following IEC technical committees and subcommittees:\n\n\nIEC TC 61 Safety of household and similar electrical appliances, \nIEC SC 61B Safety of microwave appliances for household and commercial use, \nIEC TC 66 Safety of measuring, control and laboratory equipment, \nIEC SC 17A Switching devices, \nIEC TC 96 Transformers, reactors, power supply units, and combinations thereof, and \nIEC TC 116 Safety of motor-operated electric tools"

        "content": "The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has called for human rights to be integrated into international standards to ensure the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. In a speech to the World Standards Cooperation leadership (IEC, ISO and ITU), he warned that the rapid development of digital technologies was putting these freedoms at risk. \nMr Türk argued that just as human rights serve as a set of standards that bind humanity together, technical standards must also be designed to improve the lives of communities and societies. He said it was essential to incorporate the common language of human rights into the way we regulate, manage, design and use new and emerging technologies. \nMr Türk stressed that it was not enough to ensure that standards were technologically sound and economically viable. They must also be designed with the end goal of improving lives, communities and societies through the rights and freedoms binding them together.\nMr Türk also highlighted the need for urgent action and collaboration, citing the Human Rights Council's request to his office in 2021 to analyze technical standards for new and emerging digital technologies and their relationship to human rights. He said his office had conducted wide-ranging consultations with a range of organizations, including academic experts, activists, standards development organizations (SDOs) and civil society. \nMr Türk added that he was pleased with the progress made so far, including a large public consultation, which had brought together representatives from his office, the IEC, ISO and the ITU, among others. He expressed his hope that the trend of closer collaboration between SDOs and the world of human rights would continue.\nHe said it was essential to strengthen the ethics of artificial intelligence and to place human rights at the centre of regulatory frameworks and legislation on the development and use of AI. Mr Türk called for safeguards to be put in place already at the conception phase of new technologies.\nThe UN human rights chief warned that too often new and emerging technologies were designed by men, for men. He argued that doing so excluded women's lived experiences and priorities, as well as failing to take into account the harm to women that such technologies can sometimes enable. \nThe IEC is committed to increasing stakeholder diversity and gender balance in its governance system, initiatives and programmes. Moreover, the standardization work of the IEC helps to protect both people and the environment. \nFor example, the IEC Global Impact Fund is designed to help solve specific environmental, social and governance challenges using international standards and conformity assessment. \nThe IEC Affiliate Country Programme gives developing countries access to international standards and conformity assessment programmes to build more resilient infrastructure and boost exports. They also help to ensure that electrical and electronic goods are safe and efficient\nThe IEC is committed to attracting more women to standardization and conformity assessment work and has developed guidelines for gender balance. Working closely with ISO, the IEC is investing in tools for gender-responsive standards.\nThe IEC offers a platform for dialogue between stakeholders to address societal concerns about the impact of new technologies. A special project launched with Switzerland’s Department of Foreign Affairs last year has collected different stakeholder perspectives on building trust in AI and the relationship between standards experts and regulators"

        "content": "Can international standards play a role in upholding human rights? It is a pertinent question as the UN Secretary-General and other high-ranking officials convene in Geneva for the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council.\nThe best way to answer that question is to start with a definition of human rights. According to the United Nations, human rights are \"rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status.\"\nThe UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlines the fundamental human rights and freedoms and promotes equality, justice and dignity for all. The UDHR encompasses a wide range of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and has provided a framework for developing numerous international human rights treaties and laws while also serving as a key indicator of human rights advancements worldwide.\nThe UN has also recognized that affordable and clean energy is the cornerstone for economic development, facilitating poverty and hunger reduction efforts, improving healthcare, education and empowering women. The IEC develops international energy standards that promote efficiency, safety and sustainability.\nIEC Standards can support human rights in several ways. They also contribute, directly or indirectly, to all 17 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. \nIEC work is essential in providing affordable and reliable energy services. For example, IEC 63318 is a ground-breaking international standard for rural electricity access through DC microgrids. \nIt is playing a pivotal role in eradicating poverty by giving the under-served access to safe and affordable lighting, as well as the possibility to charge mobile phones. It has already transformed the lives of rural communities in India and elsewhere. \nAccess to quality healthcare is another essential human right. IEC work in standardization provides the technical foundation for all essential medical devices used in disease prevention, diagnostics and treatment. The members of IECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment) verify and certify that medical devices work as expected and are safe to use.\nThrough its work, the IEC ensures that safety is an integral aspect of devices and systems, thereby protecting people, critical infrastructure, economies and the environment. IEC Standards address aspects of safety that apply to many products as well as those for a single product type or industry.\nIEC Standards can also protect the rights of workers. IEC 62061, for example, provides guidance on ensuring the safety of machines and those who operate them. It specifies principles that are unique to machinery control systems that provide safety functions will not only detect the risk but, additionally, take preventive action to decrease the risk.\nFinally, technical standards can promote environmental sustainability. Standards such as IEC 62430 provide guidance on how to manage environmental risks and reduce the environmental impact of electrical and electronic products. By implementing these standards, businesses can help ensure that their products are designed and manufactured in an environmentally responsible way, with consideration for the impact on ecosystems and communities.\nTo ensure that technical standards support human rights, it's important to involve a diverse range of stakeholders in the development and implementation process. The IEC is member-led and multi-layered, driven by a global community of experts and interacting with a broad range of stakeholders in society, industry and government. \nThe IEC brings together more than 170 countries. Because our standards embody global consensus on methodologies, processes and requirements, they are accepted in most of the world. They provide technical frameworks, metrics and specifications that regulators can reference in legislation. \nStandards also provide governments with technical references in public tenders, lending confidence that products meet globally agreed rules that have been developed and accepted by industry and regulators."

        "abstract": "Virtual sensors leverage developments on the artificial intelligence and machine learning front to allow for data-driven approaches to estimate key process parameters.",
        "content": "Current developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are bringing affordable virtual sensors to the IoT (Internet of Things), enabling an array of potential applications, from smart homes to industrial automation. Virtual sensors use machine learning to predict what a physical sensor would measure based on past readings.\nWhat are virtual sensors?\nVirtual sensors are software-based models of physical sensors that can simulate their behaviour and generate sensor readings without the need for actual physical hardware. They can be used as digital twins to monitor or control a physical sensor, providing cost-effective and scalable solutions for certain applications. \nVirtual sensors leverage developments on the artificial intelligence and machine learning front to allow for data-driven approaches to estimate key process parameters. In addition to being less expensive, virtual sensors provide an interesting alternative when a physical sensor cannot be placed in the preferred position due to spatial conditions (e.g. lack of room for a sensor) or a hostile environment (e.g. exposure to acids or extreme temperatures). Virtual sensor technology can reduce signal noise and, thus, increase confidence in the signals when a sensor’s output is confirmed by other sensors measuring the same phenomenon. Finally, virtual sensors are extremely flexible and can be redesigned as required, whereas physical sensors, once installed, often can only be repositioned by mechanical intervention.\nCost is a key advantage\nIndustry 4.0 is an important driver of virtual sensing technology. The information needed to digitize a factory plant is obtained from many field sensors. If only physical sensors are used for this purpose, the cost of digitizing a factory can be prohibitive for many companies. This cost can be minimized using virtual sensors.\nHow standards can help\nVirtual sensors are on the way to becoming a fundamental technology for the future of society. Their use is expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of over 30% over the next five years, and that trend will likely continue for many years to come. \nSC 41 is a subcommittee formed by the IEC and ISO to standardize the IoT and digital twin. In a recent interview with e-tech, its Chair, François Coallier mentions “Further down the line, we may be preparing standards for virtual sensors and on the quality of data: how can we ensure the vast amount of information we collect from the various sensors out there is appropriate and meets the right criteria. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42, which prepares standards for artificial intelligence, is looking at these issues, so we could be joining hands on that.”\nRead the full article on etech"

        "content": "Read the full article in e-tech.\nThe world’s biggest consumer tech event, CES, showed all the vital signs of bouncing back to its pre-pandemic self, attracting over 115 000 visitors to the Las Vegas Convention Centre – that’s more than twice last year’s numbers.\nMost of the innovations this year, from farming to utilities infrastructure – via healthcare and factory 4.0 – were led by developments happening in industry, not the home. Steve Koenig, VP of Research at the Consumer Technology Association, kicked off his ‘Tech Trends’ session on the eve of this year’s event by explaining why it was enterprise technology that was innovating this year and helping the world solve some of its greatest challenges.\nWaves of technological innovation, he theorized, tended to happen during periods of economic downturn. The last big recession of 2008 coincided with a raft of consumer-based technologies: 4G, smartphones, tablets and networks.\nIn 2023 however, as many parts of the world struggle with the challenges faced by an economic downturn, innovation is coming largely from the enterprise side as firms look to make efficiencies in production, energy, logistics and supply chain management. This, he said, was largely underpinned by a network layer of 5G connectivity and edge computing, which is fuelling industrial IoT applications, connected intelligence, autonomous systems and quantum computing. “The fifth wireless generation is the first one to be led by enterprise innovation. 5G means faster mobile broadband for consumers, but for industrial IoT applications it is really the greater capacity and ultralow latency that is going to unlock so much innovation this decade,” he explained.\nOn the show floor\nOne of the attractions of the show was to be found on a well-known home security company’s stand, which displayed a humanoid robot that is currently performing security guard tasks for a defence company client. Fleets of these robots can be controlled by human guards using VR technology which enables them to take over the robots virtually as if they were at the patrol location themselves.\nIn healthcare, an industrial 3D software manufacturer’s FDA-approved Living Heart Project enables specialists to produce what it claims to be personalized, highly accurate digital twins of human heart models for cardiovascular care.\nOne US-based farming equipment stalwart displayed an automated farming system product at the event this year that uses sensor and robotics technology to enable farms to seed and fertilize their crops. This system won the firm a CES innovation award along with its self-driving tractor, which it had launched at the show the previous year.\nIEC Standards can help\nThe IEC is paving the way for all these technologies to be used safely, efficiently and sustainably.\nISO/IEC JTC 1, the joint technical committee between the IEC and ISO, issues publications in the field of information technology. One of its subcommittees, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42, prepares standards relating to artificial intelligence. It has recently published ISO/IEC 23053, which describes how machine learning works, including deep learning.\nThe joint technical subcommittee formed between the IEC and ISO to publish standards in the areas of cloud computing and distributed platforms, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38, issues key documents related to edge and cloud computing, including ISO/IEC TR 23188, which examines the concept of edge computing and its relationship to cloud computing.\nThe IEC has recently created a new technical committee, IEC TC 129, which standardizes robotics for electricity generation, transmission and distribution systems. This includes inspection robots, which can vary in size and can be used in the air, underwater, underground and on difficult terrains. IEC TC 47 produces some of the key standards relating to sensors.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "For effective and long-lasting motors and generators, electrical insulation systems are needed. They allow electrical systems to operate safety and effectively under different conditions without significant degradation. They also prevent the transfer of electricity or heat which could result in short circuits and safeguard against voltages that can cause injury.\nHowever, insulating systems need to be assessed. To qualify the assessment, the IEC has published a new edition of IEC 60034-18-1, Rotating electrical machines - Part 18-1: Functional evaluation of insulation systems - General guidelines. This standard defines the general requirements to evaluate insulation systems based on the possible thermal, electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses that they face. The standard also recognizes that more than one factor can impact the insulating systems, such as thermal and electrical stresses, and therefore defines the requirements for multi factor functional testing.\nIEC 60034-18-1 is part of the IEC 60034-18 series of standards which addresses different types of functional evaluation and test procedures for insulation systems of rotating electrical machines. IEC 60034-18-1 provides general guidelines for such procedures and qualification principles, whereas the other parts provide detailed procedures for the various types of windings used in a motor. \n“We are very pleased to publish the latest edition of IEC 60034-18-1. It is an essential standard to help manufacturers better evaluate an insulating system and how it compares to a reference system when tested under equivalent conditions,” notes Martin Kaufhold, the Project Leader responsible for developing the standard.\nThe new edition of IEC 60034-18-1 replaces the previous version published in 2010. Compared with the previous edition, the following updates have been made:\n\n changes for the electrical qualification and evaluation of windings which are electrically stressed by converter-supply\n a focus on general guidelines:  all technical details of procedures and qualification principles have been moved  to subsequent parts of the IEC 60034-18 series\ndetails additional general aspects of functional evaluation and qualification\nIEC 60034-18-1 has been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 2 on Rotating machinery. \n\nA Commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 60034-18-1 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition. It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

        "content": "The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was an opportunity for companies to innovate and bring new content to football fans. \nAccording to research commissioned by a cloud services provider, which surveyed the audiences who planned to watch the event, viewers were largely ready for a new era of interactive entertainment offerings and were willing to pay for digital products and services that made their experience more enjoyable.\nViewers expressed interest in being part of a virtual stadium where they could watch football matches with other fans as if they were there. Gen-Z and millennials were the most interested. Those surveyed generally expressed a growing desire for more interactive experiences like 360° live video of the game, interactive in-game challenges and different AR/VR experiences.\nCompanies certainly responded to the demand for more VR and immersion in the games, judging by the products launched during or just before the World Cup. A Madrid-located immersive tech company launched a 3D football game to coincide with the event that allowed users to play their own version of the tournament, called Super Player.\nSuper Player users were able to pick a virtual World Cup team of their choice and play against other virtual national teams. They were also allowed to play as many simulated World Cups as they wanted, and the more they competed, the higher their ranking would rise for awards.\nWhile avatars and 3D worlds are not new per se – everyone in their thirties and older remembers Second Life – the speed and bandwidth offered by 5G networks, the development of edge computing, blockchain and improved graphics engines make the experience far more realistic, and easier to use, than what was ever feasible previously.\nIEC is paving the way for several of these technologies to be used in a safe and efficient way. IEC Technical Committee 110 prepares standards for electronic displays and is working on a publication which specifies the requirements for e-sports and gaming displays. The TC has already published many standards relating to VR viewing, including VR, AR and MR eyewear displays, for instance IEC 63145-1-2.\nIEC TC 100 publishes standards for audio, video and multimedia equipment, including TV sets, and has recently set up a new working group to prepare standards for multimedia systems and equipment for the metaverse. The IEC and ISO have formed a joint subcommittee, SC 24, which works on the standardization of interfaces for information technology based applications relating to computer graphics and virtual reality.\nHowever, the race is on to create a common language for the metaverse, allowing the user to go from website to website and device to device on the internet. That’s where standards organizations like the IEC and ISO have a role to play.\nWith that in mind, the IEC Standardization Management Board has set up a standards advisory group to look into what standards are required for the metaverse.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "As the uses of artificial intelligence (AI) continue to expand, there is a growing need for effective risk management to deal with issues ranging from technical, such as algorithm failures, to ethical, including bias in decision-making. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and improve our daily lives, but the risks must be carefully considered and managed\nA new ISO/IEC Standard provides essential guidance on risk management for organizations of all sizes and types that utilize AI in their systems or processes. ISO/IEC 23894 shows users how to manage AI-related risks effectively in order to achieve objectives and improve performance.\n“While AI systems are similar to traditional IT systems in many ways, they also present new aspects such as their ability to learn,” says Wael William Diab, who chairs the joint IEC and ISO committee that develops AI standards. \n“SC 42 took the novel approach of developing a framework that employs well-established techniques around risk management. ISO/IEC 23894 provides a holistic and proactive approach to managing AI-related risks with the goal of enabling users to manage the risks effectively to harness the full potential of AI.”\nA framework for risk management\nThe new standard adapts and develops the guidelines and general principles of risk management described in ISO 31000. It describes a framework for risk management that requires users to establish context and to identify, analyze, evaluate, treat, monitor and review the risks. \nEstablishing the context entails defining the organization's objectives and the risks that could impact those objectives, as well as the needs and expectations of stakeholders who will be affected by the risks. Identifying the risks is about identifying the potential risks that could impact the organization's objectives, including risks associated with the organization's activities, processes and external factors.\nAnalyzing the risks means evaluating the likelihood and impact of the identified risks, as well as the potential consequences of each risk. Evaluating means deciding which risks are worth addressing, based on their likelihood and potential impact, and determining the appropriate response to each risk.\nTreating the risks involves implementing the chosen risk response, which could involve avoiding the risk, reducing its likelihood or impact, transferring it to another party, or accepting it. Monitoring and reviewing involve monitoring the risks on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are being managed effectively and reviewing the risk management process to identify any improvements that could be made.\nA structured approach\n“Implementing this new international standard will not only help organizations to ensure that AI systems operate safely and fairly, but also help them to avoid potential risks and negative consequences,” says David Filip, convenor of the working group that developed ISO/IEC 23894. “It can help organizations ensure that their use of AI technology is safe, ethical, and aligned with their goals and values,” \nISO/IEC 23894 provides a structured approach to risk management that can help organizations to identify, assess and address risks in a proactive and effective manner. It provides a framework and principles for ensuring that AI systems operate safely and fairly, while avoiding potential risks and negative consequences. \nIt can ensure that their use of AI technology is safe, ethical, and aligned with their goals and values.\n“ISO/IEC 23894 is designed for a technology that is constantly evolving,” says Peter Deussen, project leader of ISO/IEC 23894. “It emphasises the importance of constantly reviewing, identifying and preparing for potential risks.”\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42\nMr. Deussen presented ISO/IEC 23894 at the second bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop. Topics covered at the event included AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements. \nSC 42 develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 is currently working with IEC TC 65 on a new functional safety standard for AI. The aim is to ensure that systems, equipment and devices that rely on AI technologies function safely, even in the presence of failures or errors. \nTC 65 is responsible for the IEC 61508 series of standards, which covers the design and implementation of safeguards to prevent accidents and minimize risks to people, property and the environment."

        "content": "It is with great sadness that the IEC learned of the passing of former IEC General Secretary Anthony M. Raeburn, at the age of 89, on 28 January 2023. The IEC sends its deepest condolences to his family and friends.\nA career in industry and research\nAnthony Raeburn was appointed General Secretary of the IEC in 1988, a position he held until the end of 1998. Prior to this appointment, he was division manager for airborne radar systems of GEC-Marconi in 1977 and in 1984 he became their marketing manager, responsible for the business development of the company’s seven divisions.\nRaeburn earned a BSc in physics in 1955, and in 1959 was awarded an MSc in microwave physics, both degrees from the University of London. He began his professional career in 1955 as an engineer for English Electric, and in 1960 he joined Elliott Automation as senior engineer, where he was involved in the design and development of radar systems. Later, he headed a team in an automatic landing monitoring project. In 1965 he became assistant chief engineer in the airborne section of the radio and radar division of Elliott.\nFollowing a two year period as a technical officer at the IEC central Office in Geneva, Raeburn returned to Elliott Automation in 1969, where he managed a number of highly successful research and development projects.\nDespite heavy career commitments, he found the time to write and publish several papers on subjects such as ILS monitoring techniques, airborne interception radar and military microwaves.\nLeading the IEC into the 21st century\nIn an interview with the IEC Bulletin, the predecessor of IEC e-tech, Raeburn explained that when he joined, in 1988, there was limited recognition taken of technical advances and business needs, adding that “the consensus process was administered as though it were almost a parliamentary machine: long debates considerable delays, the emphasis being on maximum consensus.” Raeburn wanted the IEC to operate in the real world: for him, the need for more cohesion within the IEC, motivation of the IEC staff, reduction of the average development time of publications and making the IEC a solvent business were the main conditions that would ensure the existence of the IEC as an independent and valued entity in the long term.\nIn short, Raeburn’s objectives were to make the IEC market relevant and, with full support from the successive IEC Presidents and Officers, to lead the Commission into the 21st century.\nFocus on new technologies\nDuring his mandate, the IEC President’s Advisory Committee on Future Technologies (PACT) was established. PACT’s role was to help the IEC fulfil industry’s future demands for standards in the area of new and emerging technologies and of systems with major electrical/electronic content.\nNew publications such as IEC PAS (publicly available specifications) and ITAs (industry technical agreements) were introduced to meet urgent market needs for a form of standardization delivered in months, not years. \nPACT, IEC PAS and ITAs were tools that helped bring the IEC into the 2000s and were abandoned as the number of technical committees addressing new and emerging technologies grew fairly rapidly.\nStructuring conformity assessment\nIn the mid-1990s, the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) was set up to endorse appointments and budgets of all IEC conformity assessment (CA) operations, provide strategic policy and direction and set goals and objectives. Two IEC CA Systems (IECEE and IECQ) were already operational and in 1996, a third system, IECEx, came into being.\nRegional partners\nThe need for agreements with regional standardization bodies was also vital for the IEC. Of great importance was the agreement with the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) in 1996 to coordinate standardization work at the international and regional level and eliminate work duplication between them. The IEC also developed ties with regional bodies in Europe (ETSI), Latin America (COPANT, CANENA), Asia-Pacific (PASC) and Central Asia (EASC).\nIEC CO goes digital\nUnder Raeburn, the IEC launched the first version of its website and worked hard to develop the IEC Webstore, which opened for business in February 1999.\nTo meet demands from the IEC community at large, the IEC Council Board developed a plan for an electronic-only environment in which the entire IEC standards development process, and related administration, be conducted electronically to help shorten development time, save reprinting and mailing costs and improve quality by enabling those involved to work on revisable documents. The target for the 100% electronic environment was 1 January 2001.\nA well respected man\nThere is consensus in the IEC community in describing Raeburn as a hard worker and an effective leader who was widely respected as a person and for the way he ran the IEC and made it a major player in the electrical/electronic standardization field.\nIEC Standardization Strategy Manager Jack Sheldon, now retired, worked under Raeburn for the 10 years of his tenure. “I remember Tony as being a very human personality. He was always approachable, even though I was a mere technical officer at the time.”"

As tiny sensors and parts are becoming a reality – notably in the watch and smartphone industries – new shapes and sizes of robots are emerging in labs around the world. The potential applications are far-reaching, from disaster relief to pollination.\nAccording to The Washington Post, Sawyer B. Fuller, who directs the Autonomous Insect Robotics Laboratory at the University of Washington, is working with his team to create a robotic fly which could be used in search and rescue operations. Such fly-robots could also be employed to look for chemical leaks in the air or cracks in the piping infrastructure.\nEven though progress has been made in producing smaller batteries and sensors, challenges remain and will require more R&D. According to Fuller, it will be difficult to miniaturize all the sensors, power packs and parts needed for tiny robots to move and send data back. Making batteries that are small but powerful enough to provide energy needed for robotic functions remains a quandary. Stabilizing robots that can fly but also carry sensors will take more design research.\nIn addition to more research, standards are and will be required to enable this new field of robotics to become a fully-fledged commercial proposition.\nIEC Standards for robotics and related technologies\nThe IEC has recently created a new technical committee, IEC TC 129, which standardizes robotics for electricity generation, transmission and distribution systems. This includes inspection robots, which can vary in size and can be used in the air, underwater, underground and on difficult terrains. IEC TC 47 produces some of the key standards relating to sensors. ISO/IEC JTC 1, the joint technical committee between ISO and IEC, issues publications in the field of information technology. One of its subcommittee, ISO/IEC SC 41, develops standards for the IoT and Digital Twin, including their related technologies. Another subcommittee, SC 42, prepares standards relating to artificial intelligence. It has recently published ISO/IEC 23053 which describes how machine learning works, including deep learning."

        "content": "Symbols are widespread throughout the electrotechnical industry and most of them are standardized and published by the IEC. Everyone knows the standby power symbol, which was developed by IEC Technical Committee 3, and can be found in IEC 60417.\nSymbols are useful because they visually summarize information which can be quite complex to describe, simply by using words. They can be employed to communicate information in a very direct manner, immediately appealing to audiences which tend to be more and more visually stimulated.\nOther symbols, which are well-less known, but just as useful for experts in electronics, are developed by other TCs in the IEC. TC 90: Superconductivity, is one of these and has prepared several symbols relating to superconductor electronics. These are now defined in IEC 60617 - Graphical symbols for diagrams, which includes symbols of resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.\nAccording to the Convenor of the working group inside TC 90, which has been working on the symbols as well as measurement methods, Masataka Okhubo, “the idea is to develop a common symbolic language for the emerging field of quantum sensing, information and computing and to involve the next generation of young experts in preparing standards.”\n\nQuantum technologies already have a significant impact on the work of IEC Technical Committees in areas such as lasers and semiconductors. More recently, quantum computing has emerged as a new and very exciting frontier for standardization, although it is still very much in its infancy."

        "content": "On February 3, 1879, the British inventor, Joseph Swan, demonstrated the first practically usable electric lightbulb to an audience of 700 people at the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. Swan’s home, in the nearby town of Gateshead, was the first in the world to use electric bulbs, while Mosley Street, in the Newcastle city centre, became the first street in the world to be lit by electric light.\nSwan's incandescent filament electric light bulb was important because it showed that electric lighting was practical and viable. Thomas Edison is credited with improving Swan’s design and the two men settled a patent dispute by jointly establishing the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company. \nLighting technology has evolved to provide better energy efficiency and greater durability. Advancements have included the use of tungsten filaments, the development of the incandescent bulb and the introduction of fluorescent lights.\nToday, the electric light bulb is an indispensable part of our daily lives, providing illumination in homes, offices, and public spaces around the world. The technology has continued to evolve, with the introduction of energy-efficient LED lights that use less electricity and last much longer than traditional incandescent bulbs.\nMore recently, lighting technology is converging with IoT and artificial intelligence to provide smart lighting solutions. Light technology also permeates many other parts of our lives.\nFor example, it allows us to scan our purchases at the grocery store and we rely on lasers for medical imaging, from MRIs to ultrasounds, and for surgery such as skin and eye treatments.\nLasers are used to cut materials in industrial manufacturing applications and for remote sensing technology. Fibre optic cables provide high-speed data transmissions.\nIEC activities\nIEC technical committees provide international standards for various types of lightbulbs, including incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lamps, and LEDs. They cover a range of topics, including the physical dimensions of the bulbs, their electrical and photometric characteristics and their performance and safety requirements.\nThey also cover components and systems in the broader fields of lighting, imaging, lasers and fibre optics:\n\nIEC TC 34 prepares Standards for lamps and related equipment including LEDs, OLEDs, lamp controlgear and fluorescent lamps\nIEC TC 47 prepares Standards for semiconductor devices including sensors\nIEC TC 62 prepares Standards for equipment used medical fields, including imaging equipment\nIEC TC 76 prepares Standards for equipment incorporating lasers and LEDs\nIEC TC 86 prepares Standards in the field of fibre optics\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\nConformity assessment\nIEC conformity assessment provides further assurance by enabling manufacturers to demonstrate that their products meet the full requirements of IEC Standards. \nFor example, the IECQ scheme for LED lighting provides a quality management platform that certifies component suppliers and the manufacturing processes of LED lighting products. This scheme has been set up to guard against the risk of low-quality and unreliable products entering the market.\nIEC Standards and conformity assessment help to ensure the quality and consistency of lighting technologies and provide consumers with confidence in the products they purchase. They also help to ensure the safety of users, protect the environment and facilitate the development of new technologies."

        "content": "Analysts across the wide range of consultancies which focus on Internet of Things (IoT) markets forecast a multi-billion-dollar surge in spending for infrastructure at the edge. As soon as 2025, Gartner predicts that more than half of enterprise-managed data will be created and processed outside the data centre (or central cloud). Deloitte forecasts in its Technology, Media & Telecommunications 2023 Predictions report an enterprise market growth of 22% for edge computing in 2023.\nKey examples of the way edge computing changes working practices can be found in smart manufacturing. “Many manufacturers collect data on the shop floor via IoT sensors and analyze that data to drive predictive maintenance and optimize machine performance,” explains Greg Hookings, Director of Business Development for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at a cloud computing provider.\nOther examples include:\n\nOil rigs in the middle of the ocean using IoT sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) to quickly detect equipment malfunctions before they worsen\nIrrigation systems in remote farming locations which adjust the amount of water used in real time by detecting soil moisture levels\nVideo feeds from street cameras, analyzed to detect if accidents occur and alert the authorities. Such traffic management scenarios are being worked upon by the Barcelona City Council, for instance.\nThe latency reduction resulting from edge computing can unlock applications like robotic surgery that rely on the analysis of highly contextualised data to make split-second decisions.\nRetail stores situated miles away from their companies’ primary data centres which use wireless point-of-sale devices to instantly process payments.\n\nAs more devices become smarter and connected, the increased generation of data will require faster networks and localized computing resources to manage it. This doesn’t mean the death of the centralized cloud, but it does signify that we will operate in a hybrid world where both central hubs and edge computing coexist.\nThe joint technical subcommittee formed between ISO and IEC to publish standards in the areas of cloud computing and distributed platforms, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38, states that the principles of cloud computing taking place in a centralized data centre should be the same as cloud computing that takes place at the edge. In other words, cloud computing and edge computing are both considered in the same continuum.\nSC 38 has published ISO/IEC TR 23188, which examines the concept of edge computing, its relationship to cloud computing and IoT, and the technologies that are key to the implementation of edge computing. IEC Technical Committee 47 publishes some of the key standards relating to sensors, including IEC 60747-14-1, which describes generic specifications for sensors.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "It is with great sadness that the IEC learned of the passing of IEC Past President Dr Seiichi Takayanagi, at the age of 93, on 23 January 2023. The IEC sends its deepest condolences to his family and friends.\nA career in industry and research\nSeiichi Takayanagi was born in Fukuoka Prefecture in 1929. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in applied physics from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, he joined Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company Limited (now Toshiba Corporation), where he initially researched the application of nuclear instrumentation and nuclear physics to the fields of power generation, nuclear medicine and aeronautics at the company’s R&D centre. While based at the R&D centre, he spent a year as a visiting researcher at the University of Manchester in the UK (1959 to 1960). From 1972, he spent almost three years as Toshiba’s Technological Attaché in New York.\nDr Takayanagi was elected Vice President and member of the Board of Directors of Toshiba in 1986. On completing his assignment as General Manager of the Technology Planning and Coordination Division, he was appointed Director of the R&D centre. Under his direction, the Centre developed such advanced technologies as the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) and digital versatile disc (DVD). He was subsequently appointed Senior Executive Vice President, with the ultimate responsibility for Toshiba’s technological development policy.\nDr Takayanagi obtained a Doctor of Science degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology.\nFor many years, Dr Takayanagi contributed to both educational and research activities as a lecturer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and visiting professor at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology. He was a member of numerous societies and served on governmental advisory bodies such as the Council for Energy (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) and the Council for Aeronautics, Electronics and other Advanced Technologies (Science and Technology Agency), and on numerous industrial committees, including committees of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) and the Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association. In 1990, Dr Takayanagi was honoured to receive the \"Person of Scientific and Technological Merit\" award from the Minister of Science and Technology.\nPromoting the IEC in Asia and around the world\nDr Takayanagi became a member of the Japanese National Committee (JNC) of the IEC in 1994 and, starting in 1998, he represented his country on the IEC Council Board (CB).  As such, he served on the working group that prepared the IEC Masterplan 2000.\nHe was IEC President from 2002 to 2004, serving as President-Elect in 2001 and as Immediate Past President in 2005-2006.\nThe first year of his presidency was marked by important milestones.\nOpening of the IEC-APRC in Singapore\nOn 21 February 2002, he presided over the inauguration of the IEC Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (IEC-APRC) in Singapore. The IEC had recognized the need to promote awareness and understanding of IEC activities among businesses and maximize the participation of IEC members in the organization’s activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Dennis Chew was appointed Regional Director and today seven staff members are based in the Singapore office.\nHigh-level meeting at IEC GM in Beijing\n\n\n \nDr Takayanagi attended his first IEC General Meeting (GM) as President in Beijing, China in late October 2002. While the programme of the GM is always established well in advance of the actual event, there was an unexpected addition to it that year: at the end of the CB meeting on 30 October, the Chinese National Committee requested a special meeting on 1 November between IEC Officers, CB members and Jiang Zemin, who served then as President of the People’s Republic of China and General secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe meeting was widely reported in the Chinese media\nJiang Zemin spoke for about an hour with the IEC delegation about the importance of IEC International Standards in world trade and their role in the Chinese economy. He said that international standardization and accreditation work is a necessary basis for the global economy, trade, industry and technology. He committed to adopt almost all IEC Standards (except those not applicable in China) by 2005.\n“They also play an active part in breaking down technical barriers in trade and contribute to the improvement of people’s lives,” he said. Jiang also mentioned that in the 1960s, as an electrical engineer, he had participated in IEC work and had fond memories of those times.\nJoining forces with sister organizations\nThe World Standards Cooperation (WSC) was established in 2002. The move stemmed from the 1999 GM in Kyoto, Japan when the IEC and ISO Presidents agreed that stronger collaboration was needed between the two organizations. At the 2000 ISO General Assembly, the IEC President recommended that IEC, ISO and ITU should cooperate more actively. Each organization formally agreed and, in 2002, the WSC was established. Under this banner, the three organizations strengthen and advance the voluntary consensus-based international standards system as an important instrument for economic development, sustainability and global trade.\n1906 Award\nThe IEC 1906 Award, which recognizes exceptional achievements of active experts in technical committees, subcommittees and the IEC conformity assessment systems, was created in 2004, during Dr Takayanagi’s presidency.\nAdvocate for a shorter development time of standards\nAs President, Dr Takayanagi urged the IEC to follow the Masterplan 2000 objective of decreasing by half the average development time of IEC publications. This was achieved during his term as President.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Dr Takayanagi was very active in promoting IEC-related activities mainly in Asia. He travelled extensively throughout the region and met with IEC stakeholders to raise awareness about IEC International Standards and conformity assessment activities."

        "content": "“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data,” says Sherlock Holmes in a Study in Scarlet, the story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that first introduced the Victorian sleuth to the world. The great detective’s point is that gathering data is always the first concrete step towards finding a solution.\nEven a challenge as huge as tackling the impact of humankind’s activities on the environment relies on our ability to gather and analyze information to make the right decisions. The Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to gather the relevant data in real-time while using a standardized approach ensures not only the quality of the data but also that it is always comparable and compatible.\nAn IoT system collects data from various sensors, such as growth meters for plants and infrared cameras for animal movement, in addition to physical, biological, or chemical sensors for air, water and soil monitoring. The data collected is transmitted through the network infrastructure, analyzed, and evaluated to monitor trends. \nOne of the major advantages of an IoT-based monitoring system is that it can provide real-time monitoring and management of the ecosystem. This makes it possible to detect changes, such as pollution, as they happen and to take corrective actions that are timely and appropriate. \nIoT helps by transforming a single-point monitoring station to a multi-point network monitoring system, enabling the observation of the entire ecosystem from both macro and micro perspectives. This results in a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem and its interactions, which can also help in taking proactive measures to prevent environmental degradation.\nA new international standard, ISO/IEC 30179, describes an IoT system for ecological environment monitoring for natural entities, including air, water, soil and living organisms. It covers the infrastructure and entities of the IoT system, as well as the general requirements\nThe new standard provides guidance on the real-time monitoring of the environment and can improve the interoperability of various eco-environmental monitoring systems. This can lead to the full utilization of the observed data for various eco-environmental applications, including the analysis of relationships between different ecological entities and the study of changing trends in the ecosystem.\nThe benefits of the IoT-based eco-environment monitoring system extend to various stakeholders, including public users, monitoring organizations, as well as government agencies responsible for managing the ecosystem. The system also provides benefits to the developers of communication modules, integrated devices, and monitoring service platforms.\nISO/IEC 30179 is a critical tool that can support efforts to monitor and manage the environment more efficiently. By providing real-time monitoring and management, the system helps to detect and prevent environmental degradation, promoting a sustainable ecosystem. \nThe new standard has been developed in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO. It is the work of SC 41, which prepares standards for the IoT."

Major work was completed in updating and aligning all our rules documents in accordance with the Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) policy. Our stakeholder groups have remained very proactive as we ease out of the pandemic restrictions on meetings and travel. The IECRE assessment programme continued apace albeit almost exclusively on a remote basis. New work was started on model validation and cyber security and the test labs continued with several proficiency testing programmes. \nWork continues in the marine sector after having welcomed our first certification body. Our photovoltaic (PV) sector has made good progress with the PV Rating System through the efforts of a small but enthusiastic group of dedicated members and the concept is now being developed to the next level.\nWe were able to hold our first management meeting with face-to-face participation in Frankfurt, kindly hosted by our friends and colleagues from the German Member Body. We were delighted to have CAB support in acknowledging Denmark’s Frank Ormel’s contribution to IECRE through the IEC Thomas Edison Award. CAB accepted our final version of an improvement plan, and we look forward to the ongoing delivery of its objectives. My personal regret is that our global assessment programme became somewhat protracted largely due to the challenges of working remotely.   \nLooking ahead to 2023, what goals does IECRE hope to achieve?\n2023 sees the start of my second and final term as Chair of IECRE and I hope that we can continue to grow the system, incorporate new deliverables and welcome new member bodies. We will be utilizing a financial model and cost base which we hope will bring added flexibility for members whilst maintaining the system’s financial stability. It is difficult to develop IECRE without a secure financial base so efforts will be required to ensure that our financial model meets member aspirations whilst allowing us to pursue new challenges. Grid issues remain a challenge but our working group in this area has made excellent progress and we hope to soon have an IECRE deliverable for Grid Code Compliance (GCC). With travel restrictions generally easing, we hope to return to more proactive face-to-face meetings and expedite the ongoing assessment programme more easily. New deliverables are always being assessed in the light of technical developments under the auspices of the Standardization Management Board (SMB) and we hope to add gearbox/drivetrain testing in the near future."

The Request for Proposals (RFP) and accompanying application form have now been published with submissions due by 8 March.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund supports projects that enable environmental, social and economic impact including through the application of IEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. The first project, Catalyzing innovation for circular models – Turning battery e-waste into e-resources, will support an SME-led project in Africa to promote battery circularity.\n“Batteries are ubiquitous. They enable connectivity, power a wide range of applications and are set to play an essential role in decarbonising our electricity supply. However, without proper end-of-life management, they can have a negative impact on the environment. For this reason, we will focus on promoting sustainable battery e-waste management in Africa for the first Global Impact Fund project,” noted Philippe Metzger, Secretary General and CEO of the IEC.\nThe project will find solutions to preserve the natural resources used in batteries and prevent their negative impact on the environment. Matthew Doherty, IEC Global Impact Fund Senior Advisor and Officer highlighted that, “We are seeking a project that has the potential to accelerate system change and market shaping through technological and business model innovation, and that has a strong focus on scalability and sustainability particularly through the use of standards and conformity assessment schemes.”\n“We are very excited to have reached this stage, within a few months of launching the Fund. The feedback from the broader community has been very positive and we are expecting some strong proposals and, ultimately, an interesting and impactful inaugural project,” noted Mr Doherty.\nNext steps\nInterested stakeholders are invited to complete the application form with details about their proposed project including its scope, activities, objectives, indicators, outcomes, output and impact, as well as the roles and responsibilities of any individuals and entities involved. A comprehensive budget plan should accompany the application form.\nSubmissions are due by by 8 March. This will be followed by a pre-screening, selection committee first-round assessments and panel interviews with shortlisted candidates. The selection process is expected to be concluded by 28 April. \nAbout the Global Impact Fund\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund advances the IEC vision for a safer and more efficient world by supporting projects that address many of today’s social, economic and environmental challenges using IEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nThrough its partnership model, the Fund will help drive the need for a coordinated, consensus-driven approach to electrification while avoiding the fragmentation that perpetuates barriers to the green energy transition.\nIt is initially supported through a three-year annual contribution of 1% of the IEC Capital & Reserves over the 2022-2025 pilot phase. This seed funding will build a global partnership aligned with the IEC values and mission."

We interview him for e-tech and the blog.\nRead the full interview in e-tech.\nLooking back at 2022, what would you say were SC 41 main achievements?\nWe published several important standards, including on the compatibility requirements for devices within industrial IoT Systems, ISO/IEC 30162 and ISO/IEC 30169 on IoT applications for electronic label systems. These standards are first editions and are more specifically to do with the IIOT – the Industrial IoT. We also published several standards on the topic of underwater sensors, some of which are second editions, like ISO/IEC 30142-2 on underwater sensor networks.  This standard, as well as ISO/IEC 30171-1, which standardizes underwater wireless acoustic networks, has many applications for industrial uses, for detecting underwater pipeline leakages or discovering underwater resources for instance, but it can also be employed for environmental monitoring.\nWe are looking at forming a joint working group with ISO Technical Committee 43 on the environmental impact of acoustic sensors used underwater. The idea is to help industry but also to minimize the impact of sensor technology on the environment and affect wildlife as little as possible.    \nLooking forward, what is in the pipeline in terms of new standards?\nWe have prepared the final draft of ISO/IEC 30179, which sets out an overview and general requirements for environmental monitoring. We have cooperated with ISO/TC 268, which deals with sustainable cities and communities over this standard. We are working on a second edition of our foundational standard ISO/IEC 30141, which defines a reference architecture for the IoT. It will be quite an evolution from the first edition and will be aligned with architecture standards from ISO/IEC SC 7, which prepares standards in software and systems engineering.\nWe are also working on several standards for digital twins. A priority will be to publish a standard on the reference architecture for digital twins in the next two years. One of the challenges is that the market is evolving at a very fast rate, and we need to be able to publish the standards that are required in a timely fashion. Other TCs are also publishing standards relating to digital twin, and we need to provide them with the framework quite rapidly. We can’t ask them to wait for us. Of course, the COVID pandemic has slowed things down a little, but we hope that thanks to future face-to-face meetings, we will overcome many of the remaining hurdles.\nFurther down the line, we may be preparing standards for virtual sensors and on the quality of data: how can we ensure the vast amount of information we collect from the various sensors out there is appropriate and meets the right criteria? ISO/IEC SC 42, which prepares standards for artificial intelligence, is looking at these issues, so we could be joining hands on that."

One of the few women at the head of a European Standards Organization, she gives us her insights on the challenges ahead for PKN. (read the full interview in e-tech.)\nCan you describe your role and what you do at the Polish National Committee?\nIn June 2022, I became the President of PKN. Since 1950, PKN has hosted the National Committee (NC) of the IEC in Poland. The role of the President of the IEC NC is also assigned to the function of the President of PKN. Prior to that, I was the Secretary of PKN for over a decade.\nI am responsible for the efficient functioning of the standardization system in Poland, not only in the field of electrotechnology but also in other areas. There are over 250 technical committees in Poland with more than 3 000 experts. PKN supports the organization and work of these committees, and is also involved in the dissemination of standards, training and education about standardization. These most important tasks and many others are carried out by around 230 people. And I make sure that everything runs smoothly.\nWhat are the most important focuses for PKN?\nIn 2020, PKN adopted a strategy for 2021-2030. It is no coincidence that the timeframe of this strategy correlates with the one adopted by international and regional standards organizations of which PKN is a member. Our mission is to efficiently organize standardization activities in accordance with European and international solutions, developed with the active participation of interested communities and parties. This, in turn, leads to the popularization of the use of standards and other standardization documents in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Polish manufacturers and service providers, facilitate trade and ensure quality and reliability of products and services. One of the strategic goals is to increase active participation in international and regional standardization organizations. \nHow is the Polish NC addressing issues around diversity?\nThere are many women working at PKN, including in managerial positions. The vast majority of senior and middle managers are women. I realize that the situation is different in technical committees, but this is changing.\nAt PKN, we are taking steps to increase the diversity in Polish technical committees. I am thinking primarily of promotional activities aimed at convincing the different stakeholder groups to participate in standardization work. We hope that a wide range of educational activities aimed at secondary schools and universities will result in increased diversity. And, of course, there is our national programme for young professionals, which we have been running for five years. This year's workshop was attended by 86 people, 52% of whom were women."

        "abstract": "On 24 January 1950, the American inventor Percy Spencer obtained the original microwave oven patent. Nowadays, IEC standards help to ensure that microwave ovens are reliable and safe to use.",
        "content": "On 24 January 1950,  the American scientist and inventor, Percy LeBaron Spencer, successfully patented a \"method for treating foodstuffs\", which was later given the more market-friendly name of microwave oven.  Today, international standards and conformity assessment ensure that microwave ovens perform efficiently and are safe to use. \nAccording to his biography, Spencer was working with magnetrons — electron tubes for amplifying or generating microwaves — when he noticed that the candy bar in his pocket had melted. He decided to experiment using corn kernels, which became the world’s first microwaved popcorn.\nSince its invention over 70 years ago, the microwave oven has transformed lives and eating habits across the world. \nSpencer’s invention has changed eating habits and made life easier, especially for working people with little time to prepare meals. More than 70 years later, microwave ovens still function in much the same way that Spencer envisaged. \nEssentially, they use microwaves, a type of electromagnetic radiation, to heat food. The microwaves are produced by a device called a magnetron, which is located inside the oven.\nThe magnetron works in conjunction with a capacitor, a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The capacitor is connected in parallel with the magnetron and helps to stabilize the voltage across the magnetron, allowing it to produce a steady stream of microwaves.\nThe capacitor in a microwave oven is capable of handling the high voltage that is required to operate the magnetron. They usually have a voltage rating of around 2500V-3000V and can be dangerous if not handled properly.\nWhen the oven is turned on, the magnetron generates microwaves, which are directed into the cooking chamber by a waveguide. The microwaves cause the water molecules in the food to vibrate, which generates heat and cooks the food.\nThe oven has a metal mesh or perforated metal sheet called a Faraday cage around the oven chamber to contain the microwaves within the oven and prevent them from escaping.\nSeveral IEC Standards are relevant for microwave ovens. Here are a few examples:\nIEC 60335-1: Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 1: General requirements. This standard sets out the general safety requirements for household and similar electrical appliances, including microwave ovens, and covers the safety requirements for the capacitors, such as their insulation and overvoltage protection. This standard is also available as a CMV.\nIEC 60705: Household microwave ovens - Methods for measuring performance. This standard describes the methods that should be used to measure the performance of microwave ovens, including power output and cooking time, for example.\nIEC 61000-3-2:  Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 3-2: Limits - Limits for harmonic current emissions (equipment input current ≤16 A per phase). This standard sets limits for the harmonic current emissions from microwave ovens to ensure that they do not cause interference with other electronic equipment.\nIEC 62301: Household electrical appliances - Measurement of standby power. This standard specifies methods for measuring the power consumed by appliances in standby mode, including microwave ovens.\nAll of these standards are covered by the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components. IECEE provides the assurance that tested and certified products meet the strictest levels of safety, reliability and performance as stipulated by the relevant international standards."

        "abstract": "IEC 62351 is a series of standards for the security of power system control centres and communication networks.",
        "content": "According to IEC 62351, a series of standards for the security of power system control centres and communication networks, \"Security measures should be built into every system from the moment they are conceived.\" That does not mean, however, that critical infrastructure locked into legacy systems cannot benefit from the principles of security-by-design. \nSecurity-by-design means taking known cyber threats into consideration during the initial design and development phase for components, software implementations, system configurations, network configurations, planning procedures and data management. For legacy systems, the standard provides practical advice on managing transitions to security-based designs, including countermeasures in all system retrofits and upgrades.\nIn essence, IEC 62351 gives detailed advice on protecting energy management systems and on the secure exchange of energy-related data. The series addresses system architecture and identifies a series of effective countermeasures that can be applied to commonly used protocols to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. \nThese include the widely used IEC 61850 standard, which defines communication protocols for electrical substations, as well as IEC 60870-5, IEC 60870-6, IEC 61970 and IEC 61968. Recent cyber-attacks on the energy sector have targeted some or all of these protocols. \nFor example, Industroyer, the malware used in the notorious December 2016 attack on Ukraine’s power grid, targeted the IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104 and IEC 61850 protocols. IEC 60870-5-104, a protocol commonly used by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA systems) in the energy domain, is the exclusive target of Industroyer2.\nIEC 62351 shows users how to implement a risk management process that not only identifies and assesses potential security threats and vulnerabilities but also describes countermeasures to mitigate or eliminate those risks. For example, they include clear definitions of user roles, encryption and authentication to protect against eavesdropping, spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks, as well as intruder detection and incident response.\nThe standard stresses the crucial importance of pervasive monitoring of the system and provides practical guidance. Systems must be subject to continuous testing during their life cycle not least because cyber threats are in constant evolution.\nProperly implemented, IEC 62351 enables the immediate detection of any power supply failure caused by a cyber-attack. It can enhance the protection of power stations and reduce the need for costly upgrades and enhancements during their operating life.  \nIEC 62351 helps to protect against malicious attacks and disruptions to the power supply, ensuring a reliable and resilient power grid. It provides guidelines for the protection of communications networks and data, as well as the management of security risks:\n\"Security includes not only firewalls or the \"encryption\" that most people assume is the only security measure necessary, but also authentication, role-based access control, prevention of denial of services, monitoring and audit functions for the information infrastructure, and last, but by no means least. security policies that enforce and supplement the security measures.\" (IEC 62351-1: Power systems management and associated information exchange - Data and communications security - Part 1: Communication network and system security - Introduction to security issues.)\nIEC 62351 is the work of IEC TC 57/WG 15, an expert group of ICS operators, SCADA engineers, security specialists and networking engineers from more than 20 countries, spread over four continents.\n \nRead more\nCyber security and resilience guidelines for the smart energy operational environment"

        "abstract": "The IEC Systems Committee for Smart cities has published a standard detailing what to consider when designing guidelines for city service continuity.",
        "content": "Electricity is the backbone to modern life. It powers the many systems in our cities, from street lights to hospitals and transportation networks. As natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and flooding occur more frequently and with greater intensity, they can have a devastating impact on cities and the many services that rely upon electricity. For this reason, cities need to put in place a plan of action to ensure the continued supply of electricity when a disaster strikes. \nIn 2020, the IEC published IEC 63152 which outlines the basic concepts of how multiple city services can cooperate to maintain the supply of electricity. However, depending on the type of service, the response to a disaster may vary.  For this reason, the IEC has published a new standard to complement the implementation of IEC 63152. \nIEC SRD 63152-2, Smart cities - City service continuity – Implementation guideline and city service cases defines what to consider when designing guidelines for city service continuity. It includes templates and use cases to ensure that service providers address the requirements for a wide range of situations caused by disasters.\nAccording to Tatsuya Shimoji, who led the project team on city service continuity, “We need to ask ourselves: if such a major disaster (possibly multiple disasters at the same time) causes a power outage, how can we, as a city, survive? This is the concept that we are trying to address.”\nContinuity planning is a key factor to minimize cost and damage should critical infrastructure become inoperable. It ensures that potential disasters have been considered and local plans developed for the restoration of services. Because no city service can operate without electricity, getting the electricity supply to function again is the most urgent and important task following disasters.\nAs Mr Shimoji notes, “With this standard, we want to provide organizations with examples and case studies that document how to ensure the continuity of electricity supply to maintain city services. In order to secure services in a city at a minimum level during grid power loss due to disasters, each organization which provides services should establish a business continuity plan to secure its electricity supplies appropriately.”\nIEC 63152-2, which is a systems reference deliverable includes city service use cases for various target organizations such as municipalities, developers, and building administrators. The city service cases included are applicable during an emergency as well as during non-emergency situations such as power outages based on normal service. \nThis standard has been developed by the IEC Systems Committee for Smart cities."

        "abstract": "IECEx is supporting the fledgling hydrogen economy to ensure the safety and security of equipment and workers operating in a hydrogen environment.",
        "content": "Hydrogen gained public notoriety on 6 May 1937, when the Hindenburg airship exploded, killing 35 people and bringing to an end the era of ocean-crossing zeppelins.  While hydrogen is extremely flammable, it is also a clean-burning fuel that many now believe has the potential to play a significant role in the fight against climate change.\nIt is widely believed that hydrogen could be an asset in the decarbonization of global energy systems, as well as potentially playing a key role in providing electricity, heat, energy storage and transport solutions. This is also because we know a lot more nowadays about keeping hydrogen safe, thanks in large part to international standardization and conformity assessment work.\nHandled by skilled professionals in industrial facilities with restricted public access and the appropriate equipment, the risks are limited. The widely touted hydrogen economy envisages much wider applications for hydrogen, meaning many more people, not all versed in the operating of hazardous areas and much greater risks of accidents.\nIECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres, is bringing its expertise to the hydrogen economy. IECEX has more than 25 years of experience in testing and certifying electrical and non-electrical equipment, repair and overhaul facilities as well as personnel competence associated with use of equipment in explosive (Ex) atmospheres.\nSince IECEx experience includes areas where hydrogen may be present, it was evident that extending its coverage to the fledgling hydrogen economy was the right thing to do to ensure the safety and security of equipment and workers operating in a hydrogen environment.\nWorking safely in a hydrogen environment\nIn addition to material assets, IECEx has also extended its IECEx certification of personnel competence scheme for assessing and certifying individuals working in potentially hazardous areas, to address hydrogen safety. For this purpose, IECEx has now added one unit of competence – Unit Ex 011 – addressing basic knowledge of the safety of hydrogen systems.\nCertification to Unit Ex 011 provides an understanding of the nature of hazardous areas, limitations on devices that may be taken into a hazardous area and the occupational health and safety responsibilities, as well as procedures related to hazardous areas. To conduct actual work in a hazardous area and/or on Ex equipment that involves hydrogen, workers would need to obtain certification to at least some of the other units of competence.\nTraining for and obtaining certification to Unit Ex 011 will undoubtedly be a plus for anyone working in the presence of hydrogen.\nAbout the CoPC\nTo cover all safety aspects in Ex environments and to complement the certified equipment scheme, IECEx has developed the IECEx certificate of personnel competence (CoPC) to provide independent proof that the certificate holder has the required qualifications and experience for working on electrical equipment located in hazardous areas and can implement IEC International Standards covering explosive atmospheres.\nFor the CoPC, competence is defined as \"the ability to apply knowledge\" rather than simply assessing knowledge. In this sense, the assessment of persons includes assessing their ability to perform certain Ex-related tasks. All individuals working in hydrogen environments would highly benefit from the training, testing and certification that the CoPC provides.\nAll IECEx certificates offer clear proof of compliance with international standards, an important assurance for anyone responsible for the safety of those working in such areas.\nRead more\nHydrogen economy: IECEx helps minimize risks"

        "content": "Investors are betting on the metaverse becoming an important part of our daily lives. According to McKinsey, in the first five months alone of 2022, organizations developing metaverse technology and infrastructure attracted more than 120 billion USD in investments.\nIt is a massive spike in investment, representing more than double the amount spent in 2021 and coming 30 years after the science fiction writer, Neal Stephenson, coined the term metaverse for his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. In the novel, Stephenson depicts the metaverse pretty much as we know it now: a virtual reality world that is accessed through the use of brain-computer interfaces. \nStephenson’s vision of virtual environments where people can interact with each other and with virtual objects in a fully immersive way has influenced the development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. It is also the inspiration behind social media networks, AR Games, VR games and VR platforms, including OpenSimulator and Second Life.\nAlthough much of the focus has been on leisure activities, including social media and gaming, the metaverse could also be used in countless other ways. Examples include healthcare, education, skills training and personal coaching. \nThe metaverse could transform office life, facilitating interactions between remote workers and making virtual meetings more engaging and more efficient. Travel operators could perhaps offer virtual tours of remote destinations on Earth or of distant planets and solar systems.\nIndustry is already embracing the metaverse with a variety of products and services, but with different technical solutions and products that are not interoperable progress has been slow. Other challenges that need to be addressed include ethics and governance issues, risk management, safety and data protection.\nWhat is also slowing progress is the lack of a common vocabulary to facilitate the exchange of information. These are all areas where international standards could make a difference.\nOf course, international standards already exist to ensure the trustworthiness and safety of the specific technologies used in the metaverse. These include, for example, artificial intelligence, haptic technology, holography, the Internet of Things and VR, among others. \nWhat we do not have yet are global standards that systematically address the metaverse as a whole. For this reason, the IEC Standardization Management Board has decided to set up a Systems Evaluation Group (SEG 15) to explore the needs of the metaverse. \nSEG 15 will develop a common understanding and definition of the metaverse, investigate the need for standardization, and provide recommendations for an initial roadmap. It will also engage with technical committees in IEC and ISO, as well as with other relevant organizations."

        "content": "A commented version of IEC 60216-5:2022 provides a quick and easy way to compare all the changes with the previous 2008 edition. Comments from the experts who developed the standard (IEC Technical Committee 112) shed light on the reasons behind the most relevant changes.\nIEC 60216-5:2022, Electrical insulating materials – Thermal endurance properties – Part 5: Determination of relative temperature index (RTI) of an insulating material specifies the experimental and calculation procedures to be used for deriving the RTI of an insulating material. The RTI is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand elevated temperatures without degrading its physical properties.\n\nThe RTI is determined by exposing a material to a series of progressively higher temperatures and measuring its electrical insulation properties at each temperature. Its performance at each temperature is then compared to its performance at a reference temperature.\nThe higher the RTI, the better the material's ability to withstand elevated temperatures without degrading its physical properties. The calculation procedures set out in IEC 60216-5 are supplementary to those of IEC 60216-3. \nIn addition, IEC 60216-5 refers to other parts of the series that are indispensable for its application: \n\nIEC 60216-1: 2013, Electrical insulating materials – Thermal endurance properties – Part 1: Ageing procedures and evaluation of test results \nIEC 60216-2:2005, Electrical insulating materials – Thermal endurance properties – Part 2: Determination of thermal endurance properties of electrical insulating materials – Choice of test criteria \nIEC 60216-3: 2021, Electrical insulating materials – Thermal endurance properties – Part 3: Instructions for calculating thermal endurance characteristics\n\nThe experimental data can in principle be obtained using destructive, non-destructive or proof tests, although destructive tests have been much more extensively employed. Data obtained from non-destructive, or proof tests can be “censored”, in that the measurement of times taken to reach the endpoint has been terminated at some point after the median time but before all specimens have reached the endpoint (see IEC 60216-1). \nGuidance is given for the preliminary assignment of a thermal class for an electrical insulating material (EIM), based upon the thermal ageing performance. While the thermal classification of an EIM is not directly related to the thermal classification of an electrical insulation system (EIS), the thermal classification of an EIS follows the same concepts as presented in this part of the 60216 series."

A maximum of four partnerships will be set up each year with each partnership able to undertake up to three projects. Current partnerships will not be affected by these new procedures.\nFocusing on projects\nAs part of the revised application process, potential mentees will need to clearly detail the projects that they would like to develop further in their country. Examples of topics include participating in the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems, setting up mirror committees, attracting stakeholders or establishing a Young Professionals programme.  \n“By focusing on specific topics with clearly defined objectives, it is possible to measure the outcome and success of the project. It also enables the IEC Secretariat to personalize the partnership based on the needs of the mentee,” notes Sei-Yun. “It is for the applicants to define what they would like to achieve and for us, together with the IEC Regional Directors, to help find the right support.”\nFor each project, participants will be asked to complete a report. “By doing so, we hope to not only increase transparency but also to provide lessons on how the IEC can better provide support to its community,” remarks Sei-Yun. These reports will serve as a basis for measuring the success of the projects and will be shared with IEC management. \nRevised timeline\nAs part of the revised structure of the IEC Mentoring Programme, the timeline has been revised. In February, mentees will be asked to submit their applications to the programme and define their projects. Prior to submitting applications, mentees will need to complete the IEC Mentoring Programme online course to ensure a full understand of the programme.\nWhile potential mentors can contact the IEC Secretariat at any time to indicate their interest in the programme, a formal call of interest will be sent out in March. This will be followed by a matchmaking week when mentors and mentees will be paired. In April, mentors and mentees will have the opportunity to discuss their partnership and clarify the project plans and objectives. \nThe partnership will then take place from 1 May until 30 April of the following calendar year with the possibility for an extension for up to six months should any work remain unfinished.\nResources available\nA number of resources are available to learn more about the IEC Mentoring Programme. This includes:\n\nIEC Mentoring Programme webpage\nMentoring course for potential member mentees and affiliate mentees\nBest practices guide\nContact the Mentoring Programme Coordinators: mentoring@iec.ch \n\nApplication forms for the programme will be available in early 2023."

        "content": "You have been Chair of IEC TC 69 for around a year and a half – what would you say have been the main achievements of your TC over that period?\nStandardization is real teamwork. Many convenors and experts work together inside TC 69 to produce the key standards required for e-mobility. My role as Chair is to put oil in the machinery. I do my best to push standardization forward, to solve problems and to support cooperation with other TCs. I would say one of the main achievements of the TC has been to keep up the momentum for standardization despite the COVID pandemic thanks to virtual meetings. We have published several standards in 2022 including, for instance, publicly available specification (PAS) IEC 62840-3, a safety publication on the topic of battery swap systems. We equally issued IEC 63119-2, which lists use cases for a charging roaming service. Such a service allows EV drivers to charge their cars outside their charging service provider's network with only one customer account.\nBut perhaps the most interesting standard is the first edition of a crucial publication, IEC 63110, which establishes the management protocol for the EV charging and discharging infrastructure. This is the first part of a standard which will address the general requirements for the establishment of an e-mobility eco-system, therefore covering the communication and data flows between different e-mobility actors as well as with the electric power system. It is an important standard for remote control and monitoring of the charging infrastructure and has the potential to support the interaction between EV end users, the local installation, e-mobility actors, the grid and the electricity market. We expect to publish the full standard towards the end of next year.\nAny new projects in the pipeline?\nWe have started several new projects in various areas, including on high power wireless transfer, megawatt charging, the exchange of local charging stations with local energy management systems, management of distributed energy storage based on EVs, to name but a few. We have also started the maintenance of several standards, for example IEC 61851-1, the basic conductive charging standard. An interesting current area of development is bi-directional energy transfer.\nWe also expect to publish many standards in 2023 that will help with the use of new technologies for charging, control and administration. We will complete the IEC 61980 series for wireless power transfer. This technology enables convenient and user-friendly wireless charging without the requirement for cables.\nRead the full interview in e-tech"

They can be found in different types of installations such as homes and offices, as well as telecommunication installations, hospitals, and solar plants. The requirements of cable ties vary depending on its application. For example, cable ties used in a solar plant will need to be heat resistant and able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. \nThe IEC has recently published a new edition of its standard IEC 62275, Cable management systems – Cable ties for electrical installations. This standard provides specifies requirements for cable ties and their fixing devices as a means used for managing and securing wiring systems in electrical installations. They can be used in other applications although additional requirements may apply. \nUsing this standard, cable ties are classified based on their material (metallic, non-metallic or composite components), loop tensile strength, maximum and minimum temperature, flame propagation and resistance to environmental influences such as ultraviolet light or corrosion. The standard also provides guidelines for testing.\nThis previous version of IEC 62275 was published in 2018. Compared with the previous edition, the new standard includes the following changes:     \n\nscope clarification and new definitions\npossibility to carry out tensile strength tests with dead weights\ndifferentiation of rubber and acrylic adhesive fixings\nclarification of mechanical testing and testing of resistance to UV light for integral devices\nrevised classification for metallic cable ties\n\n\nIEC 62275 has been prepared by IEC Subcommittee 23A: Cable management systems which is part of IEC Technical Committee 23: Electrical accessories. \nA Commented version (CMV) of IEC 62275 is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous editions.

        "content": "A ransomware attack against Costa Rica’s Ministry of Finance disrupted businesses across the country and abroad earlier this year. Costa Rican imports and exports came to a standstill that lasted for a number of weeks. \nIt underlines the increasing importance of cyber security for the global connectivity of businesses, governments and supply chains. Threat actors, ranging from criminal gangs and activists to lone hackers and rogue nations, are targeting critical infrastructure, attacking supply chains and attempting to steal personal identifiable information, including passport and credit card information. \nConsensus-based international standards, based on industry best practices, provide a tried and tested methodology to prevent and mitigate cyber-attacks in a digitally connected world. IEC develops standards to protect both data (IT) and the operational technology (OT) found in critical infrastructure.\nISO/IEC 27001\nThe joint IEC and ISO technical committee, JTC 1,  develops one of the world’s best-known cyber security standards for IT. ISO/IEC 27001 shows organizations of all sizes how to implement an information security management system (ISMS). \nThe ISMS described in ISO/IEC 27001 is a framework that provides a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology. ISO/IEC 27001 also advises on designing countermeasures (controls) to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, as well as for regulating access to critical information systems and networks to ensure business continuity.\nConformity assessment provides assurance that a standard has been implemented correctly. Organizations wanting to show that they meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 can apply for an independent assessment to obtain an international IECQ certificate of conformity.  \nISO/IEC 27036\nBusinesses rely on third-party vendors to acquire products and services, including cloud companies to store sensitive data. From a cyber security standpoint, this introduces risks to both acquirers and suppliers. \nThe four-part standard ISO/IEC 27036 provides essential guidance on supplier relationships, including supply chain and cloud service security. \nIEC 62443\nCritical infrastructure, ranging from road and railway systems to manufacturing plants and power utilities plays a critical role in a nation’s ability to trade. The international standard IEC 62443 is designed to keep cyber-physical systems running. \nThe classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, also known as ClassNK, advises shipbuilders to incorporate the IEC 62443 series into their cyber security strategies. As the operational technologies on ships grow increasingly sophisticated, they are also becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\nNowadays, malware regularly hits operational environments, including those in the maritime sector. For example, the 2017 NotPetya malware attack crippled ports, terminals and cargo-handling operations.\nIn fact, IEC 62443 can be applied to any cyber-physical environment, where IT and OT converge, and provides an effective solution for industrial supply chains, especially when combined with the IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme. The industrial cyber security programme of the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector.\nTrusted guidance\nCyber security has a critical role that supports international trade amid the ongoing digital transformation of the global economy. \nConsensus-based international standards based on best practices and the insight of experts from all over the world offer guidance that can be trusted. They provide essential advice on securing a business process from the inbound to the outbound supply chains to avoid disruption and manage risks, including financial risk."

        "content": "We are not far off the time when cyborg cockroaches fitted with video cameras could be first responders sent to locate survivors trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Researchers are already able to mount microchips and sensors onto cockroaches and other insects to control their motion by remote control. \nIEC expert François Coallier says cyborg cockroaches are a good example of the convergence of two domains that traditionally are thought of as separate: biology and digital technology. Mr. Coallier, who studied biology before becoming an engineer, was presenting a progress report to the IEC Standardization Management Board on the work of the standards evaluation group (SEG 12) on bio-digital convergence.\nThe IEC established SEG 12 to investigate current research and technology activities, identify critical challenges and to propose a roadmap for future standardization. SEG 12 is also carrying out important work on terminology, which will help to facilitate the exchange of information and to serve as a basis for future standardization activities. \nBio-digital convergence is a vast, multidisciplinary field, covering everything from biomaterials to human augmentation. Mr. Coallier explained that to address this challenge SEG 12 had set up six working groups to focus on different areas. \nThe first of these, WG 1, is responsible for communications activities, as well as drafting reports. \nWG 2 is focusing on bio-digital standardization opportunities for supporting the reverse-engineering of living systems and systems of systems. This encompasses genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, informatics, microbiomics, neurosciences and synthetics, among others.\nWG 3 is looking at standardization opportunities in life systems and bioengineering. Topics covered include but are not limited to: biosensors, biometrics, bio-foundries, bioprocessing, biofuels, drug discovery and engineering, synthetic biological circuit, metabolic engineering, genetic engineering, artificial life, organ-on-chip (OoC), and artificial organs. \nThe work of WG 4 is centred on bio-digital standardization opportunities in the area of human augmentation. It includes brain-machine interfaces, digital hardware enhancement, ubiquitous and continual monitoring, enhanced strength, enhanced sensing, embodied computing, ambient intelligence and biohacking.\nWG 5 is tasked with exploring bio-digital standardization opportunities in the bioengineering of agricultural systems and systems of systems, including forestry, aquaculture, livestock farming, cellular agriculture and molecular pharming. Topics covered include internet of things applications such as precision agriculture, as well as embodied computing for animals and the genetic engineering of food, in the framework of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger. \nWG 6 is concentrating on bio-digital standardization opportunities in the area of environmental systems of systems. Topics covered include geoengineering, sustainability and the UN SDGs related to climate action, life below water and life on land.\nFinally, WG 7 is looking into the social, risks and ethical aspects related to bio-digital convergence.\n\nMr. Coallier said that in addition to cooperating closely with the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB), SEG 12 was working with experts from ISO and the joint IEC and ISO technical committee (JTC 1), in addition to the European standards development organizations CEN and CENELEC, and several other international organizations.  He added that the multidisciplinary aspects of SEG 12's work meant that further expertise would be required in areas such as agriculture. \nThe SMB thanked Mr. Coallier and welcomed the ongoing work in SEG 12 on terminology. The SMB also acknowledged the strategic importance of bioengineering when planning future IEC technical activities."

As YP Leaders, they will each pilot a project with the support of the YP Programme and their fellow young professionals. \nThe new YP leaders have expressed their enthusiasm for the YP Programme. According to Aida Al Yaaqoubi from the United Arab Emirates, “We are surrounded by talented young professionals nationally and regionally who are unaware of the limitless possibilities to contribute to IEC. Alongside my fellow leaders and young professionals, we will strive to make a significant impact.\"\nIn the upcoming year, Aida plans to develop a database that will allow young professionals and IEC experts to connect and collaborate. She highlights the importance of having young professionals involved in standardization. “With what is happening in the world now, I feel that our opinions, our thoughts and our work should be heard and presented in current standards as well as future standards.”\nMareen Tiedemann from Germany agreed. “The YP workshop was fantastic and provided us with so many opportunities to learn about standardisation and conformity assessment. There was also time to actually get to know people and experience the diversity of the programme.” \nMareen has been an active participant in the national YP programme in Germany, Next Generation DKE, since 2019. As part of her involvement in DKE, Mareen initiated the programmes’ virtual regulars’ table, for networking, learning and “having fun”. \nBased on her experiences at the national level and results of the breakout session during the YP Workshop, Mareen plans to help IEC National Committees optimize their YP programmes by developing a guide (the so-called Dreamguide), with ideas for NCs on how to reach out to young professionals. As she notes, “Young professionals can provide fresh insight to a variety of different topics, including urgent issues such as renewable energy and decarbonisation. They should be heard in standardisation which is why National Committees should engage with this new generation.”\nCameron Chapman from New Zealand also plans to champion diversity within the IEC community as a YP Leader. “My initial thoughts for a project come from the themes that we've talked about during the YP workshop and the IEC General Assembly which centre around getting more YPs involved in the organization,” he observes.\nCameron also shared his enthusiasm for the YP Programme. “It has been a fantastic opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the IEC community and organisation. The opportunity to talk with leaders in the organisation has been invaluable. I want to maintain the energy that's been developed through the week.”\nThe three YP Leaders issued a joint statement: During the IEC YP Workshop in San Francisco, we met 85 YPs from 43 IEC National Committees; and we were astonished by the positiveness and vibrant energy of the cohort, and the motivation of the YPs to drive developments in standardization and contribute to the community. \nElected as the three YP Leaders, we are honoured to represent the 2022 YP programme cohort. In the projects we are going to lead, within the next year, we want to contribute to the further development of National YP programmes, improve contact between YP alumni, and sustainability.\nFor further information about Aida, Mareen and Cameron, please visit the YP Leaders page on the IEC website."

        "abstract": "A number of standards for specific appliances have been updated to align with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 which provides general safety requirements for household electrical devices.",
        "content": "Household appliances have developed into an immense industry. Including both large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines as well as small appliances like toasters and irons, it is a market that is expected to grow. \nAccording to Statista, the sales of domestic appliances exceeded USD 400 billion in 2020. Further growth will be driven by demand from expanding middle classes in developing and newly industrialized countries as well as the launch of smart and connected appliances.\nThe IEC provides a series of standards to ensure the safety of these household appliances. Known as the 60335 series, it is comprised of two parts, with the first part consisting of the general safety requirements for all appliances while the second part addresses the requirements for specific device types.\nThese standards provide protection against many types of hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation when appliances are used under normal conditions. It also considers how electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.\nIn 2020, the IEC published the sixth edition of its general safety requirements IEC 60335-1, Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety – Part I: General Requirements. As a result, a number of standards for specific appliances have been updated to align with the latest addition of IEC 60335-1.\nThese new editions to the IEC 60335 series include the following:\n\nIEC 60335-2-17, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-17: Particular requirements for blankets, pads, clothing and similar flexible heating appliances\nIEC 60335-2-54, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-54: Particular requirements for surface-cleaning appliances for household use employing liquids or steam\nIEC 60335-2-85, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-85: Particular requirements for fabric steamers\nIEC 60335-2-21, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-21: Particular requirements for storage water heaters\nIEC 60335-2-8, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-8: Particular requirements for shavers, hair clippers and similar appliances\nIEC 60335-2-16, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-16: Particular requirements for food waste disposers\nIEC 60335-2-3, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-3: Particular requirements for electric irons\n\nThese standards have been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 61 which addresses the safety of household and similar electrical appliances.\nAccording to Randi Myers, Secretary to IEC TC 61, “IEC 60335 standards are vital for the appliance industry to manage the risk associated with electricity and appliances. We are really excited with the speed at which we have been able to publish the new editions of these standards.”\nAvailability of Commented versions\nTo better identify and understand the changes made between the current and previous editions, these standards are available as Commented versions (CMV). Michelle Andersen, the Convener of the editing committee for IEC TC 61 which is responsible for the preparation of the commented version standards, explains that they “provide a single source document for the requirements and a brief summary of the rationale for the changes from the previous edition of the standard.” \nBy doing so, standard users, such as appliance manufacturers and certification bodies, can better understand why new requirements or revisions have been made to a standard. As Michelle notes, “The greatest benefit of the CMV is that it offers this background information in a concise and easy to use format. So far, IEC TC 61 has developed a number of CMVs for our specific appliance (part 2) standards since the publication of IEC 60335-1in 2020. We are now working with the IEC to develop others over the next couple of years.”"

        "content": "For many people living in  rural and poor areas, grid connectivity – and owning fridges connected to the grid – is not a realistic solution. But even when households are connected to the grid in deprived areas, frequent electricity outages, brownouts or blackouts create problems for conventional refrigerators, which are not designed to work in such intermittent energy conditions. The unreliable delivery of electricity – with communities often only being able to access power for a couple of hours a day – can cause equipment damage and food safety concerns.\nThese supply problems are referred to by experts as “weak grid” conditions. IEC TC 59, the technical committee which prepares performance standards for household appliances, has established a new working group, inside the subcommittee (IEC SC 59M) dealing with refrigerating appliances. It is developing a standard expected to address unique conditions that impact performance and quality of refrigerators being used in energy-constrained areas. The document will specify the essential characteristics and performance specifications of off-grid and weak grid refrigerating appliances for domestic or light commercial use, cooled by internal natural or forced air convection. The standard will also establish test methods for checking performance requirements and energy consumption characteristics.\nAccording to Patrick Beks, the Convenor of the working group, coming up with a definition for “weak grid” is one of the challenges for the standard. “We have decided to specify different weak grid classes, which vary according to the location. This is a new concept for IEC performance standardization, as it takes into account real-life situations in developing countries, where the grid does not always meet people’s expectations,” he explains.\nTo find out more about this work, read e-tech."

        "content": "Beatriz Novel was one of three women who received this year's Thomas Edison Award. She answers our questions about  the subcommittee she chairs and how gender fits into the picture.\nWhat are the challenges you face as Chair of SC 23E? Which will be the key areas for standardization in years to come?\nThere are many, many challenges. We are moving to an all-electric society and the role of IEC Technical Committee 23 and its subcommittee, 23E, will be key as we standardize protection devices that are essential for electrical installations. One of our greatest challenges is to prepare standards relating to DC technology. All the photovoltaic installations generate DC, for instance, and many consumer devices used in the home have DC loads, from mobile phones to PCs. There are DC charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries use DC as well. We need to make sure that the people using DC installations are protected. Lower-voltage DC is an important technology to enable electricity access, most notably in the developing world, and we are working to make it safe as well. We have already standardized circuit-breakers for DC and established some guidelines for residual current devices (RCD) protection. We are currently developing a product standard for DC RCDs that has been asked for by the Systems Committee for LVDC. We have been producing standards relating to the protection of charging stations for EVs for several years already and we need to maintain and improve them, as the use of EVs grows at a very fast rate. To that effect, we are working other IEC TCs, such as IEC TC 69, which prepares standards pertaining to electrical power transfer systems for electrically propelled road vehicles and industrial trucks.\nYou are one of three women this year who received the Thomas Edison Award – a historic event. What are your thoughts on gender diversity in the IEC?\nI found it awesome that three out of the six awardees were women. It shows that things are changing. However, out of the 1 800 members who attended the IEC General Meeting in San Francisco, only 400 were women. Only 26% of the Young Professionals at the GM were women, which should give cause for some concern. Women must be encouraged to go into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) studies. We need to explain what electrical and electronics standardization is in schools and at university. We should also improve flexibility at work. More should be done to help mothers take part – tools can help, remote meetings work well, and travel is not always essential, long working hours neither. Another important point is that women sometimes need to be asked to take on responsibilities. Some people don’t like to come forward unless they are invited to do so. They lack the confidence and the self-worth to step forward by themselves. We need to make sure we put the right candidates forward, ask and sometimes insist that women participate. We also need to share our experiences more.\nRead the full interview here:"

        "abstract": "A new international standard provides practical guidance, based on best practices, about managing and overseeing big data analytics.",
        "content": "Big data drives digital transformation by enabling prediction trends in datasets that go far beyond the capabilities of legacy analytic tools in terms of volume, velocity, variety and variability. Organizations require a process management framework to reap the benefits of big data analytics by ensuring that different functional groups and roles within an organization interplay with each other with the appropriate processes, purposes and outcomes. \nA new international standard, ISO/IEC 24668: Process Management Framework for Big Data Analytics, provides practical guidance, based on best practices, on managing and overseeing big data analytics. It describes processes for the acquisition, description, storage and processing of data, irrespective of the industry or sector in which the organization operates. \n“ISO/IEC 24688 provides a framework to leverage big data analytics across an organization,” said Wael William Diab, who chairs the joint IEC and ISO committee on artificial intelligence. “It builds upon the successful big data foundational standards.”\nThe new international standard will help any organization that relies on big data analytics to develop an efficient process management framework based on global best practices. The framework is designed to leverage big data analytics across all functions in the organization and includes process capability levels and process attributes for assessing capability. \nISO/IEC 24668 takes the various process categories into account, along with their interconnectivities. These process categories include organization stakeholder processes, competency development processes, data management processes, analytics development processes and technology integration processes.  \nThis framework can be used not only for managing processes but also for enabling risk determination and process improvements. It will help organizations to develop competitive advantages, as well as to improve sales and customer experiences.\n“ISO/IEC 24668 offers a unique capability in competency development processes for big data. It was based on the big data application provider, framework provider, and service partner defined in ISO/IEC 20547-3: Big Data Reference Architecture for the advancement of workforce planning, capability development, and functional knowledge for big data analytics,” said Wo Chang, Convenor of SC 42/WG 2 on Data.\n\n\nThe figure above gives an overview of the framework with the key process categories, along with process reference model and provides a process assessment model with help of a process measurement for the advancement of big data analytics in an organization. \n\nOnce in place, the management framework will enable organizations to improve decision-making and respond more effectively to both opportunities and threats. In addition, it will help organizations to reduce errors and costs. \nISO/IEC 24668 has been developed by the joint IEC and ISO committee for artificial intelligence, SC 42. The committee is responsible for developing foundational and horizontal standards for AI, including, computational approaches, data science and machine learning, as well as big data standards and analytic standards that leverage AI and big data.\n“ISO/IEC 24668 is the first assessment standard on process capability from the committee for artificial intelligence, SC 42 for big data analytics. It will help at an organisation level to understand the readiness as well as the opportunities to improve within the organization for having a better journey for implementing big data,” said Gautam Banerjee, Editor of ISO/IEC 24668.\nSC 42’s unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements and application domain needs, as well as ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available. The next SC 42 workshop is taking place on 29 and 30 November 2022.\nThe November workshop will cover four content tracks: AI applications, beneficial AI, novel AI standardization approaches, and emerging AI technology trends and requirements. It will include a presentation about ISO/IEC 24668.\nVisit the IEC Academy and Capacity Building webpage for more information and registration details.

        "content": "The light bulb is often cited as an invention that changed the world. Since the 19th century, lighting technology has advanced significantly and, most recently, has introduced smart features. With smart lighting, devices are connected to the network to enable two-way communications allowing for new features and control. Energy efficiency, automated control and wellness are some of the benefits possible with intelligent lighting technology.\nAs these technologies become increasing popular in both domestic and commercial environments, consumers need solutions that are interoperable between different manufacturers. To enable standardized solutions, the IEC has published a series of technical standards, the IEC 62386 series, that offers an open protocol for a lighting control system. Known as digital addressable lighting interface technology, it is a dedicated lighting-control protocol widely used throughout the industry.\nTo introduce the latest advancements in lighting technology, updates have been made to several standards in the IEC 62386 series including:\n\nIEC 62386-101, Digital Addressable Lighting Interface – Part 101: General requirements – System components\nIEC 62386-102, Digital Addressable Lighting Interface – Part 102: General requirements – Control gear \nIEC 62386-103, Digital Addressable Lighting Interface – Part 103: General requirements – Control devices\n\nAccording to Scott Wade, Project Leader for these three standards, “With the standardization of the digital addressable lighting interface, we are able to achieve interoperability between different vendors. The updated versions of these standards offer many new features for the control gear and control devices, as well as backwards compatibility with the previous versions.”\nThese standards have been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 34 on lighting.\nCommented versions (CMV) of the official IEC 62386-101, IEC 62386-102 and IEC 62386-103 standards are available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous editions. They also include comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

        "content": "What inspires the next generation of IEC Young Professionals (YPs) and provides an exciting and engaging experience?  We welcomed the YPs to San Francisco and Silicon Valley on Halloween with an exciting look and introduction to 5G technology.\nHow about looking at the innovative future of 5G applications? We beamed live into the 5G Innovation Centre on Australia’s Gold Coast to showcase some incredible real-world applications of 5G, including immersive learning with firefighting haptic VR suits, incredible speeds, robotics, a 5G bike helmet, shark attack search tools and rescue drones from Bondi Beach.  \nAt our special 5G workshop in San Francisco, we certainly got the YPs talking and thinking of the future.  And given it was Halloween, in a world first – we built and tested a ‘spooktacular’ 5G Pumpkin!  That’s right – we had a super-fast 5G pumpkin connected by mmWave and experienced some hair-raising multi-gigabit per second download speeds. \nKeeping with our Halloween theme, we transformed our hotel meeting room into our special test lab to debunk some scary 5G conspiracy theories regarding RF safety. We invited the YPs to do some 5G RF exposure testing to assess the “fright level” of a highly connected society. We turned it over to the YPs to do some live testing of everyday devices to bring some light to the realities of exposure levels.\nOur lab included:\n\nSpectrum analyzers and calibrated antennas \n3G, 4G and 5G mmWave connections\n5G pumpkin\nWi-Fi devices\ntwo-way radios\nbaby monitor\nradar speed gun\nmicrowave oven\nwireless power transfer devices\n\n\nOur YPs scoured the lab for the best 5G connections, searching for the best connections to fully test 5G and finally locating an optimal location in the corridors near the windows, where reception was good.\nSo, what device above has the highest level of electromagnetic energy? Our YPs had to guess and there were certainly some surprises. Some had thought that 5G would be the highest based on past fake news reports. However, 5G had some of the lowest levels and this due to its efficiency but what had the highest?\nAn everyday microwave and baby monitor had the highest levels of radio frequency from our test devices. The YPs explored different testing positions to really see the comparison live and to debunk the conspiracy theories. And was it as scary as some would fear on Halloween? No, all testing was well below the public safety limits.\nTC 106 (responsible for the methods for the assessment of electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields associated with human exposure) experts Kaitlin O’Keefe, Matt Butcher and guest Jerrold Bushberg joined me and were right at home in the new YP test lab, engaging with the YPs and sharing their knowledge and expertise.\nWe challenged the YP to keep an open mind and dream big with our 5G pumpkin and beyond!"

        "content": "Batteries are ubiquitous. Used to power a wide range of applications, from electric vehicles and trains to electronic devices used daily by people across the globe, demand for batteries is expected to increase. According to Statista, global demand is expected to increase from 185 GWh in 2020 to over 2 000 GWh by 2030.\nHowever, batteries can have a negative impact on the environment and contribute to the problem of e-waste, particularly in countries lacking infrastructure and resources to address the issue. If not safely disposed at the end of their lifecycle, batteries can release toxic pollutants into the environment with harmful consequences to human health. Proper disposal, reuse, repurposing and recycling are solutions to preserve the natural resources used in batteries and prevent their negative impact.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund has announced that its first project will focus on promoting sustainable battery e-waste management in Africa. It has now issued the first formal documents as part of the project entitled Catalysing innovation for circular models in Africa - turning battery e-waste into e-resources. \n“We are really excited to be able to move forward with the first project of the IEC Global Impact Fund”, stated IEC President Yinbiao Shu. “With this project, we will bring the benefits of IEC International Standards and the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems to help solve the challenge of e-waste and its harmful impact on human health and the environment.”\nThe first project will support an SME-led project in Africa. Interested parties are invited to respond to the Call for Expressions of Interest (CEI). Feedback to the CEI will be incorporated into the Request for Proposals (RfP) which is expected to be issued in early 2023. Further information is available from the Project Concept document. \nAbout the Global Impact Fund\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund advances the IEC vision for a safer and more efficient world by supporting projects that address many of today’s social, economic and environmental challenges using IEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. \nThe Fund will help drive the need for a coordinated, consensus-driven approach to electrification while avoiding the fragmentation that perpetuates barriers to the green energy transition. \nIt is initially supported through a three-year annual contribution of 1% of the IEC Capital & Reserves over the 2022-2025 pilot phase. This seed funding will build a global partnership aligned with the IEC values and mission."

Rockwell Automation hosted the training.\nPeer Assessment - Keeping up the grade \nIECEE, the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, is a multilateral certification system based on IEC International Standards. Its members use the principle of mutual recognition (reciprocal acceptance) of test results to obtain certification or approval at national levels around the world.\n“Peer Assessment is one of the core principles of IEC and all IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. It facilitates mutual trust among the participants, which leads to mutual recognition of test results and CB Test Certificates within the community”, said Wolfram Zeitz, Executive Secretary of IECEE.\nPeer assessor training allows IECEE assessors to maintain their qualifications, without which, they cannot operate as an assessor within IECEE. This is achieved with an exam at the end of the training.\nTopics for discussion\nThe three-day peer assessor training focuses on the harmonization of assessment criteria to ensure that all IECEE NCBs, their CBTLs and customer testing facilities (CTFs) apply IECEE rules and procedures consistently and fully comply with them.\nAdditionally, the programme also ensures that the latest modifications of rules and procedures decided recently by the IECEE management committee are brought to the attention of the peer assessors and are implemented in the assessments.\nThe training covers many aspects including:\n\nPrinciples and purpose of IECEE peer assessment\nHow to organize an assessment\nAssessor code of conduct\nCollecting data and completing reports\nPresenting the final report and follow up assessments\n\nIn addition, participants shared their experiences for testing and certification in the areas of energy efficiency (E3), electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), lighting (LITE), batteries (BATT), photovoltaics (PV), and electric vehicles (ELVH).\nDedicated to Fabio Gargantini\nThe training was dedicated to Fabio Gargantini who passed away earlier this year. Mr Gargantini was an IECEE Lead Assessor and trainer as well as the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 61: safety of household and similar electrical appliances.

That was one of the chief takeaways from an international roundtable on the SDGs that took place during the IEC General Meeting in San Francisco.\nThe SDGs are a set of 17 ambitious goals aimed at tackling climate change, poverty and other global challenges. The IEC believes that international standards and conformity assessment can help the world to achieve those goals.\nThe first part of the IEC roundtable explored the role and responsibility of corporations in addressing the UN SDGs. Distinguished speakers included: Jim Matthews, the Director of Technical Standards and Standards Policy for Corning, the US multinational technology company; Jonathan Colby, the US-based President of Streamwise Development, a consultancy company for the renewable energy sector; Ajay Garg, the Director and Chief Executive Officer of SMC Global Securities, based in India; Phil Piqueira, Vice President of Global Standards for Underwriters Laboratories (UL); and Vimal Mahendru, the IEC Special Envoy for SDGs and a co-organizer of the roundtable discussion. \nThe panellists agreed that organizations that made misleading claims about the impact of products or services on the environment and society would pay the price in the marketplace. “It's difficult to say but I think that  the profit motive is a big factor,” said Mr. Piqueira.\n“I think it's in the corporation's best interest, in the shareholders’ best interest and in the consumers’ best interest for the corporation to pay attention to the goals of the SDGs,” he continued.\nMr. Matthews concurred. “Why do we care? It’s because our shareholders want us to do the right thing, as do our customers.”\nMr. Garg said the important thing for organizations was to incorporate the SDGs into their decision-making, “Because you don't want to just pay lip service.”\n“I think one of the best ways to avoid greenwashing is to start and encourage the development of a stamp or some kind of third-party verification of these claims that companies are making,” said Mr. Colby. \n“IEC conformity assessment could enable entities and corporations to look at their own work and ask if they conform to what is required by the UN SDGs,” agreed Mr. Mahendru. \nIEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems directly or indirectly contribute to all of the 17 SDGs. They provide the foundation that allows all countries to put in place sustainable, resilient infrastructure to stimulate economic development and innovation and apply global best-practice to manage quality and risk.\nIEC International Standards embody global consensus on methodologies, processes, and specifications and are often used in regulations. They enhance access to technology and innovation, promote the development, transfer, and dissemination of environmentally sound technologies, and facilitate participation in global trade.\nThird-party conformity assessment refers to a type of certification performed by a person or organization that is independent of the seller or the buyer. It provides the highest level of assurance.\nThe IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies, into which professional conformity assessment bodies (CABs), from all over the world work together through peer assessment to ensure consistent and comparable results.\nA second roundtable panel focused on the importance of standards and conformity assessment in addressing SDGs for everyone. Roundtable co-organizer Sonya Bird, a member of the IEC National Committee in the US and of the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) provided an overview of the IEC commitment to the SDGs and work to date."

        "content": "Artificial intelligence affects every industry and has revolutionized critical fields like medicine. It supports medical professionals in diagnosis, treatment and analysis. For example, AI is used to observe the vital signs of patients receiving critical care and alert clinicians if certain risk factors increase. \nAnother area where AI has enabled scientists to make considerable progress is in the study and analysis of climate change. \nFor instance, AI can help to anticipate natural disasters and their impact. In addition to forecasting, the technology can show ways to adapt infrastructure to minimize the impact of natural disasters. It can also analyze historical data and predict future trends, allowing the building of early warning systems.\nFurthermore, AI could play an important role in making us aware of our carbon footprint. It can help to calculate the individual impact and make recommendations on how to improve it. It can be used as a tool to educate the public on how simple changes can collectively make a significant difference on a larger scale.\nIn doing so, these tools help to meet SDG 13 which is to combat climate change and its impacts.\nThe IEC and ISO are working on standards to address these technologies through their joint committee, SC 42: Artificial Intelligence. A Technical Report has been put together to address the various use cases. These include how to forecast consumption in smart grids or home energy management systems.\nRead more in e-tech."

During the Forum, Battsengel Gurragchaa, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme Leader since January 2021, provided an overview of the key achievement of the Programme over the past year.\nAs she notes, “After having celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Programme in 2021, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme continuously seeks to improve its offerings to support the affiliate countries to develop and enhance their active participation in IEC activities.”\nExpanding and strengthening participation\nSince its launch in 2001, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme has provided numerous countries with the opportunity to participate in the international standardization and conformity assessment activities of the IEC without the financial burden of membership. \n“Since the last General Meeting, we are pleased to welcome two new countries in the Affiliate Country Programme: Somalia and Timor Leste which joined in December 2021 and January 2022 respectively,” notes Battsengel Gurragchaa. This brings the ACP community to a total of 86 countries.\nParticipating countries are encouraged to adopt and reference IEC publications in their national laws and regulations and can select up to 200 IEC Standards free of any commercial consideration, for national adoption. A total of 67 countries have adopted IEC International Standards since the launch of the Programme. As Battsengel Gurragchaa announced, “This year, Angola, Liberia and Dominica have made their first declarations of national adoption.”\n“We have also welcomed Burundi and Liberia as new Affiliate Plus countries in our community. They will have new benefits such as the opportunity to increase its quota of free IEC Standards for national adoption.” An upgrade to Affiliate Plus is possible once an affiliate country has established a National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) and has adopted at least 50 IEC Standards. Currently, 37 countries have upgraded to Affiliate Plus.\nPromoting conformity assessment\nThe IEC encourages affiliate countries to adopt IEC International Standards and to recognize and implement IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) certificates and reports at the national level. Affiliate countries engage in conformity assessment in a two-stage process. With ACA prelude, affiliate countries are encouraged to acquire knowledge about the IEC CA systems while ACA status encourages affiliate countries to implement the deliverables of the IEC CA Systems. \nCurrently, 19 countries are ACA prelude and seven countries have the ACA status. “On behalf of the ACP, I congratulate the countries that have made progress in the ACA and wish them success in their future implementation of IEC CA certificate nationally,” commends Battsengel Gurragchaa.\nStreamlining the benefits of ACP\nThe Terms and Conditions of Participation Agreement has been circulated to affiliate countries for signature by the end of 2023. The agreement streamlines all the existing benefits and obligations of the Programme and includes an updated version of the Declaration of Adoption. \nRevamping mentorships\nThe IEC mentoring programme leverages the experience and knowledge of IEC National Committees to the benefit of affiliate countries. “This year, the IEC revamped its procedure which is now an annual programme, with a maximum of 4 partnerships per year. The main objective of this revamp is to enhance the commitment and insure and active participation from both parties,” notes Battsengel Gurragchaa.\nThe ACP is currently hosting five active mentoring partnerships. “One affiliate country has partnered with mentor this year: Congo with Côte d’Ivoire. We wish to their partnership great success and achieving their objectives in due time,” she notes."

        "content": "San Francisco, 28th October 2022 – Business and industry leaders from around the world are joining technology experts in San Francisco for the 86th annual IEC General Meeting (GM). This year, nearly 2’000 participants representing around 90 countries are taking part. Keynote speakers will include Laurie E. Locascio, the US Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology.\nThe 2022 IEC GM officially begins on Monday 31 October. It will focus on the importance of standardization for supporting global commerce and removing barriers to trade. International standards and conformity assessment enable businesses in the US, for example, to access new markets and to innovate on products that can be consumed around the world. \nThe standardization work of the IEC also helps to protect both people and the environment. In this context, delegates will learn more about the IEC Global Impact Fund, launched earlier this year, and how it will help to solve specific environmental, social and governance challenges using international standards and conformity assessment.\nIEC President Yinbiao Shu said, “With our Global Impact Fund, we will leverage IEC International Standards and conformity assessment to deal with some of the most pressing challenges facing the world. We must offer our contribution to make our world a better place for everyone.”\nDelegates will examine the role that international standards and conformity assessment can play in enabling a digital and all-electric society, characterized by safe, ethical and trustworthy technologies and universal access to affordable, clean and sustainable energy.\nThe IEC Secretary-General, Philippe Metzger, said: “International standards and conformity assessment are powerful tools that can help governments and regulators to implement policies more efficiently and to reach development goals more quickly. The General Meeting is an important appointment for building a better future, where everyone has access to clean and sustainable energy and where technologies like artificial intelligence are leveraged to improve global health and well-being.”\nOne of the highlights of the 2022 IEC GM will be an interactive International Roundtable on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Distinguished speakers representing a broad range of stakeholders will look at how IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems are helping to meet the SDGs. They will also examine the role and responsibility of corporations in addressing the goals.\n“All SDGs are impacted in some way by standards, which offer tools to help achieve the SDGs,” said Vimal Mahendru, the IEC envoy for the UN SDGs. “Understanding how IEC Standards and conformity assessment help to achieve the SDGs allows all stakeholders to leverage technologies and build a better world.”\nThe IEC National Committee of the United States General Meeting is hosting this year’s GM, from 31 October to 4 November. Information, including registration, is available on the IEC General Meeting website.\n\nAbout the IEC\nThe IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that brings together 173 countries and coordinates the work of 20 000 experts globally. IEC International Standards and conformity assessment work underpins international trade in electrical and electronic goods. It facilitates electricity access and verifies the safety, performance and interoperability of electric and electronic devices and systems, including, for example, consumer devices such as mobile phones or refrigerators, office and medical equipment, information technology, electricity generation, and much more.\nConformity assessment refers to any activity that determines whether a product, system, service and sometimes people fulfil the requirements and characteristics described in a standard or specification. Such requirements can include performance, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, durability, or environmental impacts such as pollution or noise. Verification is generally done through testing and/or inspection."

        "content": "A new edition of ISO/IEC 27001 provides updated guidance on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. The revised international standard comes against the backdrop of digital transformation, with cyber-attacks and security breaches surging to record levels. \nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) reports that cyber-attacks increased by a staggering 125% worldwide in 2021 and that they are expected to continue growing. Moreover, WEF’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook says that in 2021 the average cost of a data breach to companies and other organizations was $3.6 million. \nOrganizations that have not adopted or implemented a cyber security framework are the most vulnerable to cyber-crime, including successful phishing attacks, ransomware, or data theft, among others. A cyber security framework is essential for protecting sensitive data, including regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nThe information security management system (ISMS) described in ISO/IEC 27001 is one of the world’s best-known and most trusted cyber security frameworks. It is a consensus-based international standard based on industry best practices.  \nISO/IEC 27001 provides a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology. It shows users how to design ‘controls’ for protecting sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or credit card numbers, for example. \nISO/IEC 27001 offers a tried and tested methodology to build resilience by directing resources efficiently to identify attacks earlier and take steps more quickly to mitigate the initial impact. Implementing the ISMS means embedding information security in the business continuity management systems to ensure that IT services function at adequate levels during a disruption. \nUpdates and revisions in ISO/IEC 27001:2022 include new security controls in Annex A, largely anticipated by the new edition of ISO/IEC 27002 published earlier this year. It includes a number of new additions and updates, while other controls are merged to address evolving cyber-security threats.\nProviding added assurance, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance. \nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nThe cost of not having an ISMS or other effective security measures in place can be detrimental to any business, not only financially but also in terms of reputational damage. Litigation poses a serious threat to organizations, especially in cases where customers, employees, or business partners suffer actual financial losses. \nAnd that is not restricted to cases where hackers steal credit card data, for example. The phrase “actual financial losses” could also refer to a drop in a company’s share price."

        "content": "Online learning tools are one of the ways of meeting SDG 4 and IEC Standards help to make them accessible.\nDistance learning has the potential to provide a real lifeline to children in remote areas. Yet, according to a Brooking report, less than 25% of low-income countries provide remote learning opportunities and, of these, the majority are using TV and radio. Many children in remote areas have no access to computers or the internet at all. One way around this is through TV and radio, which have proven a useful vehicle for distance education, in Africa for instance.\nIEC Technical Committee 100 prepares standards for video, audio and multimedia systems and equipment, including radio and TV. The IEC 60107 Standards specify requirements for broadcast television receivers.\nSolar-powered devices in The Philippines\nIn some territories without reliable access to electricity, solar-powered radios, tablets, and Wi-Fi sets have been distributed by governments and charities to enable distance learning.\nIn the Philippines, for instance, the government teamed up with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to issue solar-powered transistor radios and other information technology (IT) kits in a bid to support distance learning among secondary school students from poor and disadvantaged families in remote areas during and beyond the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe initiative saw 6 680 solar-powered transistor radios, 3 500 android tablets and 21 Wi-Fi local area network (LAN) sets with solar-powered batteries supplied to students and teachers in selected remote schools. The IEC publishes several standards pertaining to off-grid solar PV devices and remote access to electricity. The IEC 62257 technical specifications make recommendations for small renewable hybrid solar PV systems for rural electrification. \nVirtual reality and 5G\n5G connectivity – with its ultra-low latency and high bandwidth characteristics - is enabling teachers to make use of mixed reality applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) across all areas of the education spectrum. \nSweden is at the forefront of virtual education, with the city of Kungsbacka trialing a remote learning platform that has seen positive results. The Inclubit-360 software allows teachers to provide remote support to students with physical or mental disabilities, illness or other difficulties that prevent them from going to school.  \nThe joint subcommittee formed between the IEC and ISO, SC 24, standardizes interfaces for information technology-based applications relating to computer graphics and virtual reality. This includes image processing, environmental data representation, support for mixed and augmented reality and the interaction with it.\nThe idea is to enable various systems, including software, to interoperate – bringing their cost down as they adopt standardized specifications. In the future, this should enable less rich emerging nations to have access to these technologies as well.\nRead the full article on etech"

Five of these trains began running over the summer in Lower Saxony, a state in the northern part of the country. The regional rail line intends to replace all its diesel-powered trains with this cleaner form of transport over the coming months.\nThe trains, called Coradia iLint, combine hydrogen with oxygen to produce power. They only emit steam and water, and any heat created gets recycled and used to power the vehicles' air conditioning systems.\nThe IEC has been working on two new standards to help the integration of fuel cells into railway systems for traction: IEC 63341-1, Railway Applications – Rolling Stock - Fuel Cell – Part 1: Fuel Cell Power System and IEC 63341-2, Part 2: Hydrogen Fuel System. The first revision of the Committee Draft (CD) of these standards was recently finalized during a recent IEC Technical Committee 9 meeting in Saint-Ouen, in the Paris suburbs. These drafts will be then distributed to all National Committees which take part in these standardization efforts to provide comments over the next three months. IEC TC 9 prepares international standards for the railways field including rolling stock, fixed installations, management systems for railway operation, their interfaces and their relationship to the environment.\nTo read more about these standards and the experts working on them: e-tech."

Standardization representatives from the G20 countries endorsed the declaration.\n“By referencing consensus-based international standards in their policies, world leaders can achieve priority issues goals of this G20 meeting, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). International Standards transform policy objectives into actionable outcomes,” said IEC Secretary-General Philippe Metzger. \nThe three main pillars of the 2022 G20 meeting are global health architecture, digital transformation, and sustainable energy transition. The IEC/ISO/ITU declaration underlines how international standards and conformity assessment can contribute to building a greener and more sustainable future. In addition, the declaration notes that the three international standards bodies provide an institutional framework with the participation of a broad range of stakeholders from across society.\n“International standards are instruments that enable the development of a harmonious, stable and globally recognized framework for the deployment and use of new technologies,” said ISO Secretary-General Sergio Mujica. \n“International standards are vital to global trade and economic development. Given life by collaboration and consensus, standards can help us ensure that digital transformation benefits everyone, everywhere,” said the Director of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, Chaesub Lee. \nThe Chairman of BSN, Kukuh S. Achmad assessed that standards and conformity assessments can help the world to recover together, recover stronger, and in a sustainable way.\n“In the last two years, the global pandemic has affected every aspect of people's lives, from health and education to international trade. The process of handling the global pandemic cannot be separated from the support of international standards,\" he said.\nIn the International Standards Summit 2022, standardization figures from around the world explained the correlation of international standards with the priority issues of G20 2022 and SDGs.

        "content": "\"Classification: method of structuring a defined type of item (objects or documents) into classes and subclasses in accordance with their characteristics.\"\n (ISO/IEC TS 4213)\n\nClassification is about categorizing data sets into classes. A simple example is an email spam filter, which classifies incoming messages as spam and not spam.  \nThe classifier needs examples of ‘spam’ and ‘not spam’ emails to learn how to perform the task by recognizing patterns. The spam filter will almost certainly make mistakes, which can only be ironed out by regularly evaluating its performance.  \n\nThe joint IEC and ISO committee on AI, SC 42, has developed a new Technical Specification — ISO/IEC TS 4213 — that specifies methodologies for measuring the classification performance of ML models, systems and algorithms. It describes methodologies for binary classification, such as the spam filter example given above, as well as multi-class and multi-label classification use cases.\nISO/IEC TS 4213 describes consistent approaches and methods that can be applied to comparing results more efficiently across different evaluation regimes. The new TS builds on foundational concepts in the recently published ISO/IEC 22989, which covers AI concepts and terminology.\n“Computational algorithms are at the heart of artificial intelligence systems. This novel standard facilitates consistent and fair outcomes across different algorithmic approaches,” said SC 42 Chair Wael William Diab.\n“This publication reinforces the committee’s goal of enabling broad responsible adoption of AI and complements an extensive portfolio of work that addresses the entire AI ecosystem.”\nISO/IEC TS 4213 specifies methodologies for measuring classification performance of machine learning models, systems and algorithms. It helps to answer questions, such as, 'How good\" is the model and how reliable are its predictions?'\nISO/IEC TS 4213 is part of a wide spectrum of approaches to ensure fairness and reduce bias in the increasingly prevalent ML systems on which society relies. These touch all aspects of modern life.\nFor instance, analysts estimate that three-quarters of job applications in the US are processed by algorithms. Many banks are using artificial intelligence to make loan and credit evaluations.\nLeft unchecked, bias can lead to a host of unfair decisions, including job rejections or being wrongfully denied bank loans.\nSC 42 develops international standards for AI. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, as well as ethical and societal concerns.\nSC 42 also organizes a bi-annual ISO/IEC AI Workshop series that is freely available. Archives of the inaugural workshop from May and registration for the upcoming workshop in November can be found on the workshop series website.\n \nRead more\nMeasuring the performance of ML classification"

        "content": "Can you give a short history of the IEC National Committee of Jordan?\nOn February 2010, the IEC approved Jordan's request to join the organization as its 78th member. The Jordan Standards and Metrology Organization (JSMO) formed the IEC Jordanian National Committee (JNC), with a requirement for it to achieve a balanced representation from all stakeholders in Jordan including manufacturers, ministries, government institutions, electric power generation and distribution utilities, research and development centres, universities, laboratories, the Consumer Protection Association, and so on.\nThe JNC is responsible for formulating the general policy to identify the national needs for the publication and review of Jordanian standards in the electrotechnical field. It supports the work of IEC Technical Committees by studying the drafts of international standards and adopting them at a national level. The JNC also takes part in the elaboration of standards at an international level. The country currently is a participating member in three IEC TCs and related working groups: TC 23B:  Plugs, socket outlets and switches, TC 34: Lighting and TC 61C: Safety of refrigeration appliances for household and commercial use.\nWhat are the main challenges for the Jordanian National Committee?\nThe greatest challenge facing our National Committee is the lack of financing which affects our participation in IEC TC meetings (due to the travel and accommodation costs). Jordan is an emerging economy and our financial resources are therefore limited. \nWhy did you take part in the Women@IEC video campaign?\nThe presence of women - as electrical engineers- in the electrotechnical sector has become more commonplace and encouraged. Only two decades ago things were very different, and women were very hard to find.  Participation in the Women@IEC campaign was an opportunity for me to show the ability of Arab women in general and specifically from Jordan, to be involved in the electrotechnical field, a field which not so long ago was restricted to men. It was also an opportunity to show, through the positions I have held for the last twelve years, that if women are confident, they can fill senior management roles. I also wanted to encourage more women to join us.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "abstract": "The recent cyber-attack against one of Australia’s biggest telecommunications companies underscores the vital importance of having an information security management system (ISMS) in place.",
        "content": "More than two million people have been affected in what many believe to be Australia's biggest-ever data breach. The  cyber-attack against one of the country's leading telecommunications underscores the critical importance of having an information security management system (ISMS) in place.\nThe breach exposed the names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses of the affected customers. Although the company claimed that they had been the victims of a sophisticated attack, it later emerged that this may not have been the case. \nIt is alleged that the company effectively “left the window open” by not having sufficient or effective cyber security measures to safeguard personal identifiable information (PII). Arguably, the easiest way to have protected themselves and their customers would have been by implementing international standards and getting themselves conformity assessed. \n\nConsensus-based international standards, based on industry best practices, provide a tried and tested methodology to prevent  cyber-attacks.  \nISO/IEC 27001, for example, can help in several ways but first and foremost by showing organizations of all sizes how to implement an ISMS. It is a framework that provides a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology. \nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and repercussions. It also advises on designing countermeasures (controls) to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, as well as for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nImplementing the ISMS described in ISO/IEC 27001 means embedding information security continuity in the business continuity management systems. Organizations are shown how to plan and monitor the use of resources in order to identify attacks earlier and take steps more quickly to mitigate the initial impact.\nProviding added assurance, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nThe cost of not having an ISMS or other effective security measures in place can be detrimental to any business, not only financially but also in terms of reputational damage. Returning to the Australian case, analysts believe that the company's customers are likely to launch a class action lawsuit.\nLitigation poses a serious threat to organizations, especially in cases where customers, employees or business partners suffer actual financial losses. And that is not restricted to cases where hackers steal credit card data, for example. \nThe phrase “actual financial losses” could also refer to a drop in a company’s share price.\n\nThis was the case, for example, when Yahoo shareholders brought a class action lawsuit after the company’s market value dropped as a result of criminals taking advantage of poor security to steal sensitive data. Yahoo settled for USD 80 million in early 2018."

        "content": "Environmentally conscious design (ECD), sometimes called green design or eco-design, is based on the principles of ecological sustainability. The aim is to develop sustainable products and services that minimize waste and facilitate recycling. \nECD can bring multiple benefits for organizations, their customers and other stakeholders, such as cost reduction and improved marketability, in addition to contributing to improving the environment.\nIn addition, achieving a so-called ‘circular economy’ has been a key objective of regulators around the world. In this context, regulators have started making requirements for environmentally conscious design throughout the lifecycle of products.\nThey include raw material acquisition, manufacture, distribution, use, maintenance, re-use and end-of-life. \nThe circular economy offers a new approach to achieving sustainable economic growth. Replacing a linear model where products are made, used and disposed of, the circular economy calls for a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived. \nIt is based on circular mechanisms in which products and materials can be reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured and, ultimately, recycled.\nIEC has released a number of standards relating to the circular economy. Among these, IEC 62430: Environmentally conscious design - Principles, requirements and guidance sets requirements and provides guidance on implementing ECD.\nThe standard covers physical goods, services, and a combination of the two and applies to any organization, regardless of size, type or sector. It is intended for anyone who is either directly or indirectly involved in the implementation of ECD into the design and development of a product or service.\n\nIEC 62430 notes that all products affect the environment during all stages of their lifecycle. These environmental impacts range from slight to significant, and from short-term to long-term.\nProducts may impact the environment at the local, national, regional or global level. In order to minimize these impacts, it is essential to implement ECD within the initial design and development stage. \nIn addition, IEC conformity assessment verifies that standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems. To this end, IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, tests and provides certification to IEC 62430, as part of its approved process (AP) scheme. \nThis helps to provide international confidence that the products and services of organizations holding IECQ Certification are designed in accordance with the ECD principles of IEC 62430. In this way, they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12, which is to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns."

The proposed directive is based on the IEC standards for USB-C and power delivery IEC 62680-1-3 and IEC 62680-1-2. \nMany manufacturers around the world have already adopted the IEC 62680 series of standards. It specifies the common charging interoperability requirements of external power supplies (EPS) for use with data-enabled smart mobile phones up to 100 Watts.\nIn addition to smartphones, a wide range of other devices will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C port before they can go on sale in Europe. They include digital cameras, earbuds, e-readers, handheld videogame consoles, headsets, keyboards, laptops that are rechargeable via a wired cable, mice, portable speakers, portable navigation systems and tablets. \nSix hundred and two MEPs voted in favour of a common charging solution, while 13 voted against and eight abstained. The 27 EU member states are expected to approve the directive later this month in what is seen as a formality.\nMember states will then have 12 months to transpose the new rules and a further 12 months to apply them. \nThe vote means that European consumers will no longer need to replace their chargers when they purchase a new device. The new rule will enable them to use a single charger for a wide range of small and medium-sized portable electronic devices.\nThe EU Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, celebrated the result on Twitter: “As of autumn 2024, the time when we had to fight with many different chargers will start becoming a memory of old, strange times of unnecessary costs, waste and inconvenience,” she tweeted.\nOne of the main aims of the regulation is to reduce e-waste by allowing consumers to reuse existing chargers. \nAround 420 million mobile phones and other portable electronic devices were sold in the EU in 2020. According to an EU impact assessment study in 2019, 29% of chargers sold with mobile phones in the European Union in 2018 had a USB-C connector.\nThe EU estimates that disposed of and unused chargers generate 11,000 tonnes of e-waste every year.\n \nFind out more\nRelated content in e-tech:\nAn interchangeable charging solution for all consumer electronic devices is here\nMultimedia:\nWatch a video that explains the benefits of IEC 63002; co-developed by IEC TC 100 experts and USB-IF."

        "content": "Some 828 million people in the world faced hunger in 2021. This is about 180 million more people since the UN embarked on its 2030 Agenda in 2015. Conflict, climate change and various economic shocks exacerbated regional inequalities in 2021. And this is before even alluding to the current cost of living crisis and rise in food prices, triggered by the war in Ukraine, which will be a hugely aggravating factor in 2022.\n“One major problem is that the amount of available arable land is decreasing because of climate change and growing urbanization,” says analyst Brandon Beh, at consultancy firm IDTechEx. “Globally, we need to increase food production efficiency and technology can help us do this.”\nOne of the answers - but far from the only one - is vertical farming. There are already more than 2000 vertical farms in the US, growing produce such as lettuce, herbs and berries. British firm Jones Food Company is building what it claims is the world’s largest vertical farm (1,5 hectares) in Gloucestershire. It aims to supply 70% of the UK’s fresh produce within the next 10 years. One research company expects the industry to grow to $9,7bn worldwide by 2026. Proponents believe the concept can feed millions of people.\nOthers aren’t so sure. “If vertical farming is the only way we can produce enough food to tackle food insecurity, then it is not the answer,” says Beh. “Only in an extreme scenario where the climate is so bad that we cannot farm outside does vertical farming become the only solution.”\nThe problem with vertical farming is its cost. Aside from banks of LEDs, it requires a network of sensors and cameras to collect data about plants and the environment. “Those who cannot already afford conventional farming technologies are not going to be able to afford vertical farming,” says Beh. However, standardization in all these areas - cameras, sensors, LEDs etc- can help to bring the cost of the technology down and create a level playing field for manufacturers involved in supplying vertical farmers. IEC is developing standards in these different areas relevant to vertical farming. For instance, IEC 62031 establishes safety specifications concerning LED modules for general lighting. IEC Technical Committee 34, which publishes this standard, has set up an advisory group on horticultural lighting, AG 15, which provides a coordinated approach to standardization in this area.\nRead more: On the path to global food security | IEC e-tech"

        "content": "Wind turbines play an important role in global efforts to combat climate change but must themselves be able to cope with extreme weather conditions. International standards and conformity assessment ensure that they can withstand even hurricane-force winds.\nThere are many examples of wind turbines surviving extreme conditions, which was not the case 40 years ago, before standards and refined dynamics models were available. Indeed, the IEC 61400 series evolved as a result of turbines failing in extreme wind conditions.\nNowadays, wind turbines are built to strict guidelines found in IEC 61400. For example, IEC 61400-1 defines the design conditions (“external environmental conditions” combined with a wide variety of turbine operating conditions) that onshore wind turbines must satisfy to satisfy certification requirements. \nIEC 61400-3 adds the external conditions that must be considered for offshore designs.\nIEC 61400-1 recommends a special design class for areas with very high extreme winds, whether hurricanes (North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific), typhoons (north-western Pacific Ocean) or cyclones (South Pacific and the Indian Ocean). Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are all storm systems with winds exceeding 119km/h (74 mph).\nThe design class presented in IEC 61400-1 enables turbines to withstand winds of around 290 km/h, which is almost 180 mph. It also allows design for even more severe external conditions, when needed.\nThe annexes of the standard include the unique characteristics of hurricanes and guidance on how to address them in the design process. The magnitude of winds, waves and other important design conditions are determined by specific site data.\nThe IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications(IECRE) evaluates whether a turbine design meets the requirements in IEC 61400. It is the only internationally developed transparent conformity assessment system.\n“What is required is that every offshore and onshore installation specifically defines all the external conditions that may occur at that site over the expected life of the project, usually 30 years but no less than 20 years,” says IEC expert Sandy Butterfield.\n“This requires the project developer to gather historical data for their site and use it to forecast a set of design conditions which projects the extreme winds, waves, currents, and any other events that the turbines could experience, including hurricanes.”\nIEC TC 88 is responsible for developing the IEC 61400 series and other standardization in the field of wind energy generation systems. This includes wind turbines, wind power plants onshore and offshore and interaction with the electrical systems to which the energy is supplied."

        "content": "In 2019, both IEC and ISO signed the UNECE Gender Responsive Standards Declaration, pledging to make the standards they develop and the standards development process they use gender responsive.\nSignatories committed to, among other things, “acknowledge that representation of women in standards development is almost always below parity and that the outcomes for men and women are not explicitly addressed during the standards development process.” They also committed to taking action to ensure that standards become gender responsive.\nJoint effort between IEC and ISO\nThis led to several initiatives including the founding of the ISO/IEC JSAG on gender responsive standards. One of the JSAG's initial tasks was to conduct the first ever industry questionnaire on gender-responsive standards development among IEC and ISO technical committees and subcommittees.\nPerspectives were gathered from 356 respondents (50% IEC, 50% ISO). The committees covered a range of sectors, from the technical industries to the service-orientated ones. \nThe overall results of the questionnaire unearthed the lack of gender responsiveness in standards development and showed that a lot of work remains to be done for standards to fully address the gender issue.\nGuidance document on gender responsive standards\nOne of the decisions taken, following these results, was to draft a  joint guidance document on gender-responsive standards targeted at IEC and ISO technical committees, to help them include gender considerations in the standard development process.\n\"This guidance document aims to provide standards developers and all technical committee (TC, SC, PC, SyC) and working group (WG) participants with important considerations and questions to aid them in ensuring the standards they are developing are gender responsive. Given the breadth and depth of standardization, there is no singular solution to ensuring that a standard is gender responsive. As such, this guidance is intended to be the first in a series of joint ISO-IEC communications, training and technical policy products on GRS,\" the document explains in the introduction.\"\nAs part of the guidance, an optional GRS assessment form will be sent to standard developers to be filled when embarking on new work items or revising existing standards. The JSAG also commits to providing training together with UNECE on how to use the document over the next 18 months. Feedback from the TCs is also encouraged. A letter signed by IEC Secretary-General & CEO Philippe Metzger and ISO Secretary-General Sergio Mujica was sent out to the various stakeholders at the same time as the document, urging standard developers to read the guide and fill in the form.\n\"The ISO/IEC JSAG has been working very hard over the last few years to address gender issues in standards development.  We have all learned how important it is for our technical committees to understand and recognize that standards are experienced differently based on a person's gender. One of our goals in the ISO/IEC JSAG was to ensure that both men and women benefit equally from standards which resulted in the team preparing a guidance document on  Gender Responsive Standards.  This guidance will help ISO and IEC technical committees and the standards they develop remain relevant today and in the future for the benefit of all society, \" says Lynne Gibbens, co-convenor of the JSAG from the IEC.\n\"In the future we want the standards we write to remain relevant – relevant to all, be it man or woman! Inclusion and diversity are key requirements for standards  to be used everywhere. I believe that if this guideline and checklist on gender responsive standards is used by our technical community, we will take a huge step towards implementing that vision. The guide is not mandatory, but I hope it will inspire and be of great practical use for anyone involved in standard writing,\" says Karin Lindmark, co-convenor of the JSAG from ISO.\nTo find out more about the document, click here."

This is why they require specialized knowledge, skills and experience.\nIn addition to the certification of electrical and non-electrical equipment, IECEx offers a certificate of personnel competence (CoPC) scheme certifying the skills and expertise of those working in Ex areas, so that anyone in an Ex location benefits from the highest level of safety.\nThe CoPC provides companies working in the Ex field with independent proof that a person has the required competence and capability (based on qualifications, experience and demonstrated ability) to implement the international Ex standards and to work on, or repair, equipment located in hazardous areas. This can be especially important for consultants and contracted staff.\nThe international IECEx certificate is personal, non-transferable and valid across international borders. As well as the certificate itself, IECEx-approved personnel are also furnished with a wallet-sized identification card with photo ID traceable to the IECEx certificate itself, providing instant proof of certification. It complements the IECEx certified equipment scheme and IECEx certified service facilities scheme.\n \nWatch the video on the IECEx certification of personnel competence scheme on YouTube\nWatch the video on the IECEx certified service facilities scheme on YouTube\nWatch the video on the IECEx certified equipment scheme on YouTube\nWatch the videos on the IECEx certified equipment scheme (available with subtitles in 10 languages), the IECEx certified service facilities scheme and the IECEx certification of personnel competence scheme on the IECEx website homepage: www.iecex.com/"

        "content": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos famously warned that there is no alternative to digital transformation. Visionary companies, he said, will carve out new strategic options for themselves, while those that do not adapt, will fail. The world of standards and conformity assessment is no different and that is why the IEC and ISO are driving the digital evolution of international standards to address the current and future needs of citizens, societies and economies globally.\nIEC and ISO are collaborating closely on SMART to align their visions and ambitions. The joint programme aims to ensure that IEC and ISO products and services remain the most attractive and relevant to markets and societies, today and tomorrow. \nSMART is a digital capability that will transform the way IEC and ISO share knowledge supporting the world of tomorrow. It refers to the formats, processes, and tools necessary for users (humans and machines) to interact with standards over the entire dynamic lifecycle. \nThere is no plan to phase out existing formats such as paper and pdf. Instead, SMART will offer a unique opportunity for IEC and ISO to implement digital solutions that serve the needs of all stakeholders, from industry, regulators, and end-users to society as a whole.\nStandards developed today by IEC and ISO are focused on humans as primary users. While these standards can be read by computers, they cannot be interpreted and therefore comprehensively processed by machines. \nThe next generation of IEC and ISO standards will provide tailored and up-to-date content at the right time to the relevant users, whether they are humans or machines. Manufacturers are expected to integrate SMART standards into their entire product and service lifecycles to accelerate development at a lower cost and ensure compliance with the latest applicable regulations. \n\nSMART will enable standards developers to focus on content creation in a much more effective way by using advanced digital tools to automate processes over the whole development lifecycle. End users will benefit from digital standards whose content is tailored to their needs and updated constantly.\nRegister for the upcoming IEC SMART standards webinar to find out more, including the expected benefits to standards developers and users. The webinar takes place on Tuesday 27 September at 13:00 (local time in Switzerland)."

        "content": "Electricity meters measure energy consumption and some provide load management functionality. In most countries, the energy consumption measured by the meter forms the basis for energy suppliers to generate a bill for consumers to pay for their usage. \nIn some countries, payment meters are used that provide consumer with the ability to pay for their energy consumption at the meter. Payment meters have the facility to accept credit by means of a token (e.g., smart card, key, or over the air). They measure the energy usage and, through the use of in-built tariff data, deduct the charge from the available credit. Payment meters are fitted with a supply control switch that cuts off the supply when the available credit has been exhausted. The supply is restored when more credit is added. Features such as Emergency Credit allow consumers to restore their supply if they cannot, for some reason, manage to top up their credit.\nSmart meters often have the facility to be configured as payment meters, providing the ability to be topped up remotely over the air in real time, which can be more convenient for consumers.\nTo ensure the performance and functionality of these meters, the IEC published an updated edition to IEC 62055-31, Electricity metering – Payment systems – Part 31: Particular requirements – Static payment meters for active energy (classes 0,5, 1 and 2). This second edition replaces the first edition published in 2005.\nAccording to John Cowburn, the Project Leader responsible for the development of IEC 62055-31, “The electricity grid is undergoing massive transformation, particularly with the introduction of smart meters in many countries. Customers need access to a reliable power supply with transparent and flexible billing solutions. The updated version of IEC 62055-31 brings the standard into alignment with the recently updated metrology and safety standards.”\nThe new edition of IEC 62055-31 defines the functional requirements that apply to payment meters, including basic informative requirements as well as test methods for some operations, while also providing flexibility for the wide range of options available on the market. IEC 62055-31 has been designed to align with the requirements of IEC 62052-31 which specifies product safety requirements for equipment for electrical energy measurement and control. \nIt has been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 13: Electrical energy measurement and control. \nA commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 62055-31 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition. It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

        "content": "The authors of a new report claim that from a strictly economic point of view, even climate deniers should support the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The Oxford University study says that going green could save the world as much as 12 trillion US dollars by 2050.\nIt dismisses the 2022 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as overly pessimistic. The IPCC said that keeping global temperatures rises under two degrees would result in a loss of GDP by 2050.\n\"There is a pervasive misconception that switching to clean, green energy will be painful, costly and mean sacrifices for us all – but that’s just wrong,\" says Professor Doyne Farmer. \"Renewable costs have been trending down for decades.\n“They are already cheaper than fossil fuels in many situations, and our research shows that they will become cheaper than fossil fuels across almost all applications in the years to come. And if we accelerate the transition, they will become cheaper faster.”\nAnalysts agree that limiting global warming will require a major transition to renewable energy, as well as increased energy efficiency. The IEC provides the tools that will enable such a transition. \nPromoting energy efficiency\nA number of IEC technical committees develop energy efficiency standards for specific products and systems, such as IEC TC 59 for household appliances, TC 100 for audio, video and multimedia systems and TC 2 for motors. In addition, the IEC has set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) to help IEC technical committees adopt energy efficient solutions and support energy efficient technologies through their standards.\nConformity with standards is necessary to verify the energy efficiency claims made by manufacturers. IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, operates the Electrical Energy Efficiency (E3) programme to test and verify energy efficiency for electrical/electronic equipment, based on IEC International Standards.\nAdopting renewable energy\nThe IEC develops a number of standards to ensure the safety, performance and efficiency of renewable energy systems for wind (IEC TC 88), solar (IEC TC 82), hydraulics (IEC TC 4), marine (IEC TC 114) and solar thermal (IEC TC 117). IEC Standards also facilitate the integration of renewable energy systems in the electrical grid.\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications), is specifically designed for renewable energy systems. Established in 2014, IECRE provides third-party certification of equipment and services in the solar, wind, and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and performance.\nSustainable transport\nIn February 2022, the IEC set-up a new systems committee that will address the issue of the future of sustainable transport. It will work together with a number of IEC technical committees such as those involved in railways (IEC TC 9), shipping (IEC TC 18), batteries (IEC TC 21), electrical accessories (IEC TC 23), road vehicles (IEC TC 69) and personal e-transporters (IEC TC 125).\nCircular economy\nUsing materials more efficiently, including reusing and recycling products and minimising waste, also plays a significant role in combatting climate change. Material efficiency, which is an essential part of the circular economy, calls for the conservation of materials by making products more durable and resource-efficient, in addition to facilitating the reuse or recycling of parts at the end of their life.\nCurrently, the IEC is developing a number of standards related to the circular economy, including general method for assessing the proportion of reused components in products, guidance on material circularity considerations in environmentally conscious design and sustainable management of waste. In addition, the Advisory Committee on environmental aspects () provides guidance on issues related to the environment, including the circular economy and material efficiency.\nThe IEC is fine-tuning the existing toolkit to facilitate the work of governments. A new advisory group has been set up to evaluate the potential for standardization activities addressing product carbon footprint evaluation and documentation in digital format.\nIn addition, IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, is collaborating with  IEC TC 111, which develops horizontal standards related to the environment, to develop climate change-related conformity assessment services."

        "abstract": "For IT, cyber security is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. The cyber-physical assets that keep modern society safe and functioning need a different approach.",
        "content": "All too often, cyber security is understood only in terms of IT, where the emphasis is on protecting, in equal measure, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called C-I-A triad. Unfortunately, this approach does not work for the cyber-physical assets that keep modern society safe and functioning. \nThese assets, also known as critical infrastructure, are found in a wide range of sectors, such as energy, health, manufacturing and transport. \nThe Industrial Internet of Things has accelerated the growth of cyber-physical systems, where the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT) converge. Sensors and monitors connected to OT gather, analyze and communicate data with other devices and systems to improve quality, efficiency and safety. \nIn cyber-physical systems, where IT and operational technology (OT) converge, the emphasis must shift from protecting the C-I-A triad to prioritizing safety. That is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk and the priorities are about protecting people and the environment. \nIn the cyber-physical world, everything is geared toward the physical movement and control of devices and processes to keep systems working as intended. For example, OT helps ensure that a generator comes online when there is an increase in electricity demand, or that an overflow valve opens when a chemical tank is full, in order to avoid hazardous substances spilling. \nIn OT environments, industrial automation and control systems (IACS) run in a loop to check continually that everything is functioning correctly. These systems include the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology and human-machine interfaces (HMI) that are at the very heart of cyber-physical systems. \nFrom a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that, unlike business systems, IACS are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. Moreover, cyber-attacks on IT and OT systems tend to have different consequences. The effects of cyber-attacks on IT are almost exclusively economic, while cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure can impact the environment, damage equipment, or even threaten public health and lives.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges based on global best practices. For example, IEC 62443, is designed to keep OT systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.  \nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nIn an ideal world, power stations and other critical infrastructure would be secure by design. In addition to security standards for key communication protocols, IEC 62351 provides guidance on designing security into systems and operations before building them, rather than applying security measures after the systems have been implemented. The thinking is that trying to patch on security after the fact can at best be only a quick fix and at worst comes too late to prevent the damage from being done."

IEC National Committees can now collect, consolidate and submit their national comments to IEC TS 62600-200 ED2 directly in the OSD platform.\nIEC TS 62600-200 ED2 has been developed entirely on the OSD platform and is the second draft IEC publication to use the OSD member commenting features. “We are very excited to be piloting the online standards development and welcome it as a positive improvement. IEC TS 62600-200 ED2 is one of our five standards written using the OSD platform and the first of IEC TC 114 standards to reach the CD stage,” notes Jonathan Colby, the Chair of IEC TC 114 on marine energy.\nIn June, IEC 60512-28-100 ED3, prepared by IEC SC 48B, became the first IEC draft standard at the CD stage to pilot the member commenting features on the OSD platform.\nUnderstanding the OSD platform\nThe OSD platform is a joint IEC and ISO programme that provides standards developers with new digital tools to streamline the process of drafting and editing international standards. The platform enhances efficiency and collaboration throughout the process, from the preparation of a standard to its final publication.\nThe Authoring stage of the OSD pilot enabled IEC technical committees to use the OSD platform to draft international standards. The second stage, which introduced member commenting features, launched on 5 July 2022. \nBenefits of online member commenting\nThe OSD member commenting simplifies the process for IEC members to collect and provide feedback during the standards development commenting stages. It aims to enhance collaborative work and consensus building while also increasing efficiency.\nBecause the member commenting process is handled online, National Committees no longer need to manage multiple documents or complete separate forms. They benefit from a secure environment that allows experts to make their comments directly in the context of the draft standard. New tools are available, such as comment grouping as well as tagging and filtering.\nOSD member commenting process\nThe IEC Secretariat disseminates the link to the CD document once the ballot opens.\nThe National Committee Admin (NCA) is responsible for providing access and permission to national mirror committee experts. These national mirror committee experts, representing national stakeholders, are invited to provide their comments. They can access the platform using their existing IEC credentials or an external authentication system.\nThe NCA resolves comments received from their national experts. These comments are submitted to the IEC as the national position. Depending upon the arrangement within an IEC NC, this role may be administered by a National Mirror Committee Secretary.\nUpcoming training sessions\nTraining sessions will take place on 20-21 September to guide IEC National Committees on the use of the OSD member commenting features. They will address the following topics:\n\nHow can NCAs provide access to national mirror committee experts?\nHow can national mirror committee experts comment?\nHow can NCAs/national mirror committee Secretaries resolve comments, and submit their national positions to the IEC?\n\nRegistration and further details are available from the IEC Academy."

In a digital environment bursting with huge volumes of data, ontology can help retrieve, process, use and reuse information. \n“They are a vital part of ensuring interoperability, linkability, traceability, discoverability and explainability of digital content, particularly machine readability, executability and interpretability of digital content for intelligent decision making and smart actions,” explains Manikandan Krishnankutty, a Co-convenor to the IEC working group on terminology for smart cities (SyC Smart Cities WG 1). This can bring many benefits to a smart city which is comprised of many different systems.\nWithin the IEC, work is underway on smart city ontologies to support consistency among ontologies relevant to smart cities and to ensure that any city related ontologies or data models used in IEC Standards are consistent with those developed by other standards development organizations (SDOs). \nTo build awareness about smart city ontology standards being developed by international SDOs, the IEC System Committee (SyC) on Smart cities is organizing an international virtual seminar together with the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee on ICT.

These large data storage \"farms\" are key enablers of the digital transformation of our economies.\nThese aggregated computer networks provide important services such as data storage, backup and recovery, data management and networking.\nLarge server networks are big consumers of electricity and generate a large amount of low-level heat. Not only do they require a lot of energy to function, but they also need power to run the cooling and air-conditioning devices which enable them to perform at their best.\nWhile the heat generated by computing power can be repurposed and used for domestic heating, for instance, routine energy management processes are implemented in the data centres themselves to reduce their overall energy and heat consumption.\nIn order to measure how data centres contribute to increasing CO2 emissions through their large consumption of energy, key performance indicators (KPIs) are required. That is where the work of ISO/IEC Subcommittee 39: Sustainability, IT and Data centres comes in.\nIt has published several standards which enable policymakers and other stakeholders to measure the effect of data centres on climate change. ISO/IEC 30134-1 defines common requirements for a holistic suite of KPIs for data centre resource efficiency while ISO/IEC 30134-8, which has just been published, presents specific rules on the Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) metric, along with its theoretical and mathematical development.\nThis document concludes with several examples of site concepts that could employ the CUE metric."

        "content": "IECEE, the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, is a multilateral certification system based on IEC International Standards. As the Chair of IECEE, Steven Margis notes, “Since its establishment in 1985, we have had a substantial global impact ensuring the safety and performance of products, reduced costs and delays for industry and boosted global trade.”\nWhen it comes to new technologies and services that are developed, IECEE has taken a flexible approach to allow it to respond to the evolving needs of its members.\nCybersecurity\nTechnology has brought in many advantages, but these benefits also bring challenges. To ensure security in industrial automation and control systems, the IEC has published the IEC 62443 series of standards. In 2016, IECEE developed a programme to test and certify cybersecurity based on parts of this series. Certification to IEC 62443 requires an assessment against a set of technical capabilities or process-oriented capabilities.\nThe certification programme for cybersecurity is based on the identified market needs of its stakeholders. “We are offering a solution that leverages IEC standardization in an emerging technology to introduce defined levels of cybersecurity to the marketplace. With cybersecurity, we focus on capabilities, competencies, and maturity and security levels. It is not our traditional approach of empirical laboratory testing to determine compliance results.” mentions Margis.\nArtificial intelligence\nAI and machine learning (AI/ML) require standards to establish international consensus regarding approaches to compliance in these emerging areas. While the standardization of AI is underway, it remains a nascent technology within the realm of conformity assessment. \nIn addition, AI/ML technologies introduce new challenges for conformity assessment since they operate dynamically, continually evolving, learning and adapting. “These use cases and applications will require both the standards and conformity assessment communities to re-assess time honoured models to ensure appropriate levels of compliance to meet market needs and expectations can continue within the framework of these modern technologies.”\nSMART standards\nAs part of its digital transformation, the IEC is exploring ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a more flexible way. Together with ISO, the IEC is developing a common vision for so-called SMART standards that will be modular, machine readable, and eventually, machine interpretable and executable.\nConformity assessment is essential to the integrity of IEC Standards and has been included within the scope of the SMART standards work. As Margis notes, “Conformity assessment will need to assess how SMART standards will impact the conformity assessment services offered in relation to these standards. \nAn evolution is underway in lockstep with the needs and requirements of IEC stakeholders and the larger community of global acceptance interests. To be effective to those interests, it is key that the IEC continues to expand its reach and engage market stakeholders, including regulators and local acceptance interests, via its network of National Committees and related Member Bodies from full members, associate members and affiliate members alike.”\nRead the full article on etech."

        "content": "What is your technical background?\nMy personal technical interests lie in aspects of electrical network control and operation functions, so called SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and DMS network control systems that are used by grid owners, combined with the securing of maintenance aspects for the smart grid. I have been dealing with the practical aspects of the IEC 61850 Standards for the smart grid, which play a key role in the set-up of network automation. I am also a member of the IEC Board Task Force on SMART Standardization and Conformity Assessment.\nSecuring the electricity grid, this critical asset for society, is of utmost importance, especially today in the turbulent market situation we are facing in Europe. A reliable and robust grid, both in normal and abnormal conditions, becomes a key requirement for ensuring our societies continue to function normally. Such a grid is also essential to enable the all-electric transformation.\nHow is SESKO dealing with issues such as inclusion and diversity?\nIn my view, inclusion and diversity should be considered as core values of any organization, as they are essential in bringing about success. At SESKO, they are building blocks of our strategy, and they have been aligned with our sustainability goals. Our extensive network of experts, which are very diverse, build the strength of the whole organization. We must meet the ESG (environmental, society and governance) challenges while considering social criteria. In the end it also boils down to the ways we support and serve our key stakeholders.\nWhat are the key challenges for SESKO now and in the future?\nWe have updated our strategy, heading towards 2030, in a similar fashion to the IEC. Our vision requires SESKO to be the most knowledgeable partner for electrotechnical standardization locally. Moreover, Finland has set the ambitious goal of being carbon neutral by 2035, which impacts requirements for industry as well as technical development aspects. Recently, the Finnish Ministry of Trade published a statement on the national energy and climate strategy, where it recognized the role of international and European standards as means to increase national competitiveness. I feel the introduction of new value-added tools such as the commented versions of IEC Standards (CMVs), combined with the use of the new online standardization platform will give powerful new possibilities to the standardization experts and standards users. At the same time, it is important that these key applications are developed carefully so that they truly support the work of experts. SESKO must be pro-active in following up and supporting the development of these and other ICT-tools during pilot phases to ensure local compatibility.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "abstract": "Current air conditioners have a negative impact on the environment. The IEC published a new standard on refrigerants which enables a broader use of climate friendly refrigerants.",
        "content": "With the increase in heatwaves sweeping across the world the demand for air conditioners is on the rise. According to the IEA, the number of air conditioners in use will grow from 2 billion today to 5,6 billion in 2050.\nUnless new, efficient ways of cooling and more environmentally friendly coolants are applied, this will have a significant negative effect on the climate.\nA newly published standard, IEC 60335-2-40, Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety – Particular requirements for electrical heat pumps, air-conditioners and dehumidifiers, is helping to alleviate this problem. It allows for the use of refrigerants with a lower global warming potential (GWP) while also putting in place the necessary measures to ensure a high level of safety.\nUnderstanding refrigerants\nRefrigerants are a key element in the refrigeration cycle. However, because some of the most commonly used refrigerants were harmful to the ozone layer, worldwide efforts to reduce the use of such substances led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. While the Montreal Protocol has allowed the ozone hole in Antarctica to become smaller, it has also led to the replacement of certain substances with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that may not damage the ozone layer but are considered greenhouse gases with the potential to cause global warming.\nAs a result, countries adopted the Kigali amendment, which entered into force on 1 January 2019. It requires countries to phase out the use of HFCs by more than 80% over the next 30 years.\nSignificant update of IEC 60335-2-40\nThe new edition enables the broader use of climate-friendly refrigerants, while addressing the safety and performance of electric heat pumps, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. These new safety measures help limit leaks and increase the circulation of airflow to dilute the concentration of the refrigerant.\nAsbjørn Vonsild, who led the revision to the standard, said, “IEC 60335-2-40 ED 7 enables a broader use of climate-friendly refrigerants by providing new safety test methods to expand options for new technologies and alternative construction of appliances using these refrigerants.”\nIndustry-wide consensus\nIEC 60335-2-40 has been unanimously approved by IEC National Committees demonstrating widespread consensus from countries all around the world. Over seven years, 55 experts representing 17 countries participated in 100+ meetings that culminated in the unanimous approval of IEC 60335-2-40 in April 2022.\nAchieving climate targets\nIEC 60335-2-40 will enable governments to fulfil their obligations under the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol by providing options to reduce the reliance on HFCs in air conditioners and heat pumps. In Europe, for example, proposed legislative updates to limit emissions from HFCs.\n“IEC 60335-2-40 enables the European Union to implement the Kigali amendment by providing options to reduce the reliance on HFCs in air conditioners and heat pumps,” Vonsild noted.\nThe focus on heat pumps is another environmental benefit of IEC 60335-2-40. Heat pumps are more energy efficient compared to other heating and cooling systems, their increased adoption can help limit the negative impact on the environment.\nA commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 60335-2-40 Standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition."

        "abstract": "IEC Technical Committee 4 prepares standards for hydro-turbines, which are gradually adapting to dryer and hotter summers.",
        "content": "The very high temperatures during the summer and the lack of rain have drastically reduced the level of water in many of Europe’s main rivers, including the Po in Italy and the Rhine in Switzerland, France and Germany. This in turn generates lower levels of hydropower in countries which traditionally rely strongly on that energy in the overall power-mix.\nMany forget that hydropower is the most important source of renewable energy in the world and that it is also essential to meet the 2050 zero emissions target. Broadly, the two most common forms of hydropower in Europe are run-of-river plants, which rely on continuous water flow from a river to generate power, and reservoir storage, which stores water behind a dam and releases it in a controlled way to produce electricity.\nUnsurprisingly, run-of-river plants have been hit the hardest this summer as river water levels dropped. Hydropower plants are having to adapt to this new situation using the latest technology.\nMost plants have been around for many years and are having to renew their equipment to be able to face these new challenges.\nIEC Technical Committee 4 publishes a wide number of standards pertaining to the safety and performance of hydraulic turbines. According to the TC 4 Chair, Pierre Maruzewski: \"Climate change and environmental degradation have resulted in a reduction of water inflow at some hydropower plants, as well as a decrease in reservoir levels.\n\"It is important to bring facilities that have been around for decades up to date. Turbines have evolved a lot over recent years and can be adapted to different water flows and function at variable speeds, for instance. \n\"Some hydropower plants suffer from water head reduction, together with a decrease in efficiency of energy conversion in hydro turbines. Variable speed turbines can be a more energy-efficient solution. Sensors and microprocessors perform better every year thanks to technology innovations.”\nAmong the many standards published by the TC, the IEC 63132 series provide guidance for installation procedures of hydroelectric machines. These standards are very useful for countries wishing to install new hydro facilities and which have little or no prior knowledge of hydro power."

Following is an excerpt from the interview.\nHow does TC 114 work relate to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?\nIn our recently approved strategic business plan, we have identified ten SDGs to which we contribute to, either directly or indirectly. Marine technology is grounded in sustainability. In TC 114, it is part of our DNA. It is quite a natural fit for us to connect to the SDGs. Within the industry, I talk a lot about the disconnection that would exist if our industry would pollute the environment while claiming to be a clean, renewable energy – that would not work in the marketplace! Inherently, our equipment must be safe for the environment and be sustainable because we are fundamentally contributing to a sustainable energy future. If our devices and equipment are harmful to the environment, that goes against our main goals for the industry.\nHow are standards evolving in the marine industry as it morphs from a testing and experimental sector into a fully-fledged commercial proposition?\nOne of our concerns when we started our work as a TC in 2007 has always been the lack of in field application of the standards, as we were essentially dealing with test facilities and prototypes. The TC 114 community has recognized the need for standards that are more adapted to commercial-scale deployments. The lessons learnt from applying the standards in the real world have had an impact. Several priorities are identified in our new strategic business plan and relate to open water and commercial scale deployments. One of them is to develop a new suite of standards on installation, operation and maintenance necessary to meet the needs of our growing industry.\nHow has the first certification body for marine energy systems inside IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) been a game changer?\nThe progress in IECRE is of huge importance to the marine energy sector. In 2020, we had our first test laboratory and in 2021, the first certification body. Most international mature industries are built on a foundation of standards and certification. For us to achieve relevance and grow in the marketplace as an industry, our technology must have third-party independent verification. We want to avoid the mistakes made by other industries. We are leveraging the experience of the wind energy industry, one of the sectors of the IECRE. This is of huge importance to us in driving our industry forward.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "abstract": "The IEC and ISO publish a new technical report that provides advice on addressing ethical and societal concerns about artificial intelligence",
        "content": "IEC and ISO have published a new Technical Report (TR) that provides advice on addressing ethical and societal concerns about artificial intelligence. Intended for technologists, regulators and society at large, it takes an objective and practical approach.\n“Our committee took the novel approach of concurrently working on enabling broad adoption by looking at the entire AI ecosystem and simultaneously addressing ethical and societal concerns,” said Wael William Diab who chairs the IEC and ISO joint committee on AI. “Ethical considerations are tightly integrated across the entire work program of the committee. This project provides the blueprint of how it all comes together to enable responsible AI adoption and its benefits.”\nIndeed, the growing program of work within the committee not only has dedicated projects such as this one on ethics and societal concerns but enables and supports responsible adoption across the portfolio of work. For instance, use cases, governance, foundational, trustworthiness, the management systems standards and other projects directly and indirectly address this topic. This novel approach means that the suite of standards that the committee works on is ready address this topic from day one, highlighting the importance of responsible adoption. “This publication is for all AI stakeholders,” says the project convenor, David Filip. “It gives them practical guidance on ethical frameworks, risk mitigation and best practices.”\n“Handled properly, AI can radically transform the world for the better,” says the project leader, Viveka Bonde. “ISO/IEC TR 24368 will help regulators and decision-makers who often struggle to keep up with the rapid evolution of the technology.”\n“This is an essential and practical guide for anyone interested in acquiring a greater understanding about the responsible adoption of AI technologies. It is non-partisan and objective,” said ISO/IEC expert Lenora Zimmerman. \nThe TR leverages use-cases to apply the principles and themes discussed to real world situations and technical work.  One of the examples concerns semi-autonomous vehicle platooning.\nOne of the use-cases describes a convoy of trucks travelling along a motorway in close formation. The lead driver grips the wheel as she stares out at the road in front, but the vehicles training behind are self-driving, freeing the other drivers to sleep, read social media posts or pursue other interests. \nThe authors of ISO/IEC TR 24368 use the road train example to highlight a number of issues, ranging from stress and boredom for the driver to trust over system reliability when driving next to a computer-controlled platoon. They identify a number of ethical and societal considerations related to the use-case, such as accountability, professional responsibility, privacy, safety and security, community involvement and development, respect for the rule of law and labour practices. \nThe TR provides a general introduction to the broad categories of ethical theory — virtue ethics, utilitarianism and deontology — and international human rights practices. It includes practical examples of practices for building and using ethical and socially acceptable AI. \nISO/IEC TR 24368 features a handy glossary of terms and definitions, as well as a bibliography for further reading. Two annexes provide additional context.\nAnnex A presents a selection of principles for AI that have emerged out of the international community. Annex B offers practical use-cases linked to the themes and principles identified in the TR.\nThe ISO/IEC AI committee, known as SC 42, brings together engineers, ethicists, lawyers and others to work on issues such as trustworthiness and biases in algorithms, as well as foundational concepts, data standards, reference architecture, use-cases and application guidelines. Recent SC 42 publications include guidelines on algorithms and the governance of AI in organizations."

However, to fully leverage the benefits of these technologies, standards are needed. \nGiven that cities are made up of individual though interconnected systems that must be addressed holistically,  the IEC set up its Systems Committee (SyC) for Smart Cities. Together with the IEC technical committees, it ensures that IEC Standards fully address user needs. It also collaborates with other standards development organizations (SDOs) to provide solutions that can leverage the know-how of each organization and avoid overlaps.\nTo better understand the work of the SyC Smart Cities Advisory Group (AG) 10 on Cooperation, IEC e-tech spoke with its Convenor Wei Sun who also serves as the Vice Chair for SyC Smart Cities.\nWhat are the objectives of the SyC Smart Cities AG 10 on Collaboration?\nAG 10 on Collaboration was established in July 2021 with the objective of proposing policies, methods and procedures to support collaboration using the IEC systems approach within IEC technical committees and system committees as well as with other SDOs that have common interests in the field of smart cities standardization\nSince its establishment in mid-2021, what has AG 10 achieved so far?\nBecause a smart city is a complex system of systems, SyC Smart Cities needs to establish and maintain liaison with other IEC technical committees, subcommittees, system committees and advisory groups as well as with ISO and other SDOs. To date, IEC SyC Smart Cities has established 15 liaisons with IEC committees (TCs/SCs/SyCs), 12 liaisons with ISO committees as well as several liaisons with the ITU.\nWhat are the benefits of cooperating with IEC SyC Smart Cities?\nIEC SyC Smart Cities focuses on the demand side to capture the requirements of all stakeholders that can benefit from electrotechnical standards. The work of AG10 is to collaborate with the relevant IEC TCs/SCs/SyCs to develop, maintain and implement an overall work plan to provide the standards needed to support smart cities. We also work closely with other SDOs to ensure that IEC Standards fit within the packages of standards needed to meet the requirements of smart cities.\nMost of the standards that result from our work will be developed through cooperation with other IEC TCs/SCs/SyCs and SDOs. AG 10 seeks to build a communications channel that can collect and explore the interests and concerns of SDOs related to smart cities. \nRead the full article on e-tech"

        "content": "The IEC has just published IEC 63318, the first standard developed by the Low Voltage Direct Current (LVDC) Systems Committee. Rajeev Sharma is the Convenor of the working group which prepared this essential document.\n“I am convinced this standard, once implemented, will prove to be a game changer as it will enable to bring electricity access to millions of deprived households across the world,” he says.\n“LVDC will act as an enabler for electricity access by the use of locally generated DC power through non-conventional sources, such as sun or wind. It will also bring greater energy efficiency,” Sharma points out\nApplying the World Bank Multi-Tier Framework\nThe standard adopts the World Bank’s Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) initiative approach, which redefines the way energy access is measured, going beyond the traditional binary measure of “connected or not connected” for electricity access.\nThe MTF starts with the lowest level of access (Tier 1), referring to limited access to small quantities of electricity for a few hours per day, enabling the household to use electric lighting and phone charging This level of access can be provided by a small solar lighting system.\nHigher tiers of access are defined by higher capacity and longer duration of supply, enabling the use of medium and high-load appliances (such as refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioning). IEC 63318 refers to level 2 and level 3 of the World Bank classification.\nChallenges addressed by IEC 63318\nThe standard had to solve several technology conundrums, some of them dealing specifically with the co-existence of DC systems with an AC grid. According to Sharma, other challenges included: “defining a voltage that is inherently safe and results in low distribution loss; earthing considerations; being compliant with other existing standards while addressing current needs; paving the way for its evolution into a microgrid standard in the future; and, last but not least, ensuring scalability and a sustainable ecosystem of parts and suppliers”.\nRead more in e-tech."

That is why an effective cyber security strategy must address not only processes and technology but also people. \nEnsuring those practices and procedures are properly maintained relies on an efficient governance model, such as the one outlined in ISO/IEC 27014. This standard defines cyber security governance as the “system by which an organization’s information security systems are directed and controlled”. \nIt is the job of all managers in an organization to implement the relevant policies and principles in their departments. Unfortunately, senior executives in some organizations continue to believe that cyber security is a problem for the IT department.\nAn organization’s CEO plays an important role in defining the values of an organization. He or she has the power and influence to make cyber security an important part of the organizational culture. \nLack of awareness about risk issues is a sign of a weak cyber security culture. It can be easily remedied with training and capacity building activities, which should start at the new employee induction stage. \nISO/IEC 27014 recommends training and awareness programmes to establish a positive information security culture. The standard recommends roles and responsibilities for executive management and boards of directors in all types and sizes of organizations. \nThe objectives of the standard are to “align security program and business objectives and strategies, deliver value to stakeholders and the board, and ensure information risks are adequately managed”. \nThe standard defines six overarching governance principles, which are defined as “accepted rules for governance action or conduct that act as a guide for the implementation of governance”:\n\nestablish organization-wide information security\nadopt a risk-based approach\nset the direction of investment decisions\nensure conformance with internal and external requirements\nfoster a security-positive environment\nreview performance in relation to business outcomes\n\nIt also defines five governance processes, which are “a series of tasks enabling the governance of information security and their interrelationships”: evaluate, direct, monitor, communicate and assure. Together, these principles and processes form the governance of information security.\nIEC develops cyber security standards and conformity assessment for both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). These include two of the world’s best-known cyber security standards: IEC 62443 for cyber-physical systems and ISO/IEC 27001 for IT systems. \nIEC 62443 also calls for regular training for all employees to minimize the risks caused by human error.\nConformity assessment provides further security by ensuring that the standards are implemented correctly: IECEE certification for IEC 62443 and IECQ for ISO/IEC 27001."

Understanding the relationship between the 17 SDGs and cities goes a long way in making our cities smart, sustainable, resilient, safe, and secure.\nAs a first step, international standards development organizations (SDOs) need to map their standards with the relevant SDGs. To develop a comprehensive strategy to map all the SDGs with different city aspects and develop a holistic set of standards to guide city stakeholders, a group has been constituted under the IEC ISO ITU Joint Smart Cities Task Force.\nHow to map the 17 SDGs with city systems \nAs a first step, we need to first develop a conceptual/reference model for sustainable development followed by a conceptual/reference model for smart cities. Based on these models, we can identify, and define the relevant KPIs for the cities in the context of the SDGs and their targets.\nThis is followed by mapping the standards developed by the IEC, ISO and ITU, as well as other SDOs to the agreed KPIs.

        "published_day": "2022-08-08",
        "abstract": "Lea Emmel, 2021 YP Leader, provides her perspective on how the IEC can benefit from age diversity.",
        "content": "The issue of age diversity is often neglected in everyday work and its importance is truly underestimated. This is precisely why it concerns all of us - especially in the field of standardization.\nIn standardization, the term \"expert\" is used to refer to those who develop standards. An expert describes a person who has a high level of knowledge or skill related to a particular subject or activity (Weinstein, 1993). This does not necessarily associate the term with a specific age, as if one might think of when looking at the average age in standardization committees. Although no statistics exist on the average age of members in IEC committees, most experts will certainly agree that it tends to be above average.\nAt the same time, new technologies are increasingly pushing their way into standardization. Younger experts are coming along with them, but they often do not have enough experience in the development of standards. With its Young Professionals Programme, the IEC is already actively building this knowledge, but the practical experience can only be gained through real standardization work in the committees. It becomes clear that age diversity is a significant topic for standardization and that it should be in everyone's interest to tap the potential of multigenerational teams.\nAge diversity creates a balance between traditional and modern practices by exploring new ways of thinking. In this context, communication and collaboration are crucial for creating the appropriate dynamics where unique ideas can grow.  \nIn addition, the exchange of experiences is essential. More experienced standardization experts can share knowledge and at the same time have new experiences with younger ones. In return, the younger experts can contribute new ideas. The exchange of knowledge and the discussion of certain specifications can lead to a more effective problem solving, which in turn advances standardization.\nThe development of standards based on a consensus approach involves many discussions and requires time. However, this procedure is essential to ensure the necessary acceptance of standards. With uniform teams of experts, it would certainly be easier to find consensus quickly, but uniformity prevents innovation. Above all, innovation is an important factor in addressing the challenges of tomorrow. Diverse experience, knowledge and perspectives are therefore essential to develop innovative solutions. Promoted by age diversity, mixed-age teams empower each other to apply methods and thought processes that are not necessarily common for the respective age group. \nAnd finally, there are various studies (Hammermann et al., 2019) showing that mixed-age teams increase the productivity of the team as a whole, rather than that of individual members. The increases in productivity are primarily linked to the shared knowledge gained from previous experiences, which enable new solutions to problems.\nAge diversity can thus provide a competitive advantage, promote the exchange of experiences, drive innovation, and increase productivity. Young and experienced experts can perfectly complement and learn from each other. After all, only a mixed-age team allows experience and wisdom to come to the fore just as much as young enthusiasm and inquisitiveness. This once again highlights the importance of actively involving the next generation within the IEC.  \nLea Emmel was elected as IEC YP Leader in 2021 and is working as a risk manager for the medical device manufacturer Dräger in Germany. In her YP project at the IEC, she is addressing the issue of standardization in university education and hopes to\ncontribute to the IEC so that it can benefit from the advantages of mixed-age teams.\n \nSources:\nWeinstein, B.

        "content": "The task of our IEC System Committee on Smart Cities is: To foster the development of standards in the field of electrotechnology to help with the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems.\nIn other words, it is to help ensure that all the many standards of relevance to cities that are being developed by IEC and other standards development organisations (SDOs) provide a consistent and helpful set of guidance.\nRole of WG 1 on Terminology\nThis is where Working Group 1 on Terminology has a vital role to play. Our focus is to develop a multidisciplinary concept system to enable all the stakeholders to use the same “language”, to promote harmonized terminology and consistent vocabulary that can be used by all IEC standards committees and by other SDOs. \nWe are developing definitions for key smart city related terms and a concept system to show how they all relate together in order to help TCs and other SDOs to describe their standards using consistent terms. As of August 2022, WG 1 has undertaken two projects in the area of terminology and concept systems. \n\nIEC SRD 63235 Smart city system - Methodology for concepts building was published in 2021. \nIEC 60050-831 International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) – Part 831: Smart city systems to be published in 2023.\n\nWork on ontology\nOntology is becoming a key subject in the world of IoT, big data, AI and digital twins of smart cities and smart city systems standards and SMART standards. An ontology defines the concepts and relationships used to describe and represent an area of knowledge.\nOntologies are used to classify the terms used in a particular application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those relationships. They are a vital part of ensuring interoperability, linkability, traceability, discoverability and explainability of digital content, particularly machine readability, executability and interpretability of digital content for intelligent decision making and smart actions.\nRecognising the inevitable role ontology has to play in the domain, we are building on existing projects to develop an ontology framework to support the move to machine readable and machine actionable standards.\nThus, WG 1 attempts to scope out and develop work on smart city ontologies to support consistency among ontologies relevant to smart cities that are published by other international SDOs and to ensure that any city related ontologies or data models used in any IEC standard are consistent with those developed by relevant groups in ISO, ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU-T, W3C, and IEEE. WG 1 has undertaken the project on Smart city systems ontology gap analysis to be completed in 2024.\nTwo virtual workshops on ontology for smart cities and smart city systems were held by WG1 in September 2020 and November 2020. An international virtual seminar on ontologies for Smart Cities and Smart City Systems is to be held on 22-23 September 2022 jointly organized by IEC SyC Smart Cities, ISO/IEC JTC 1, and the IEC Academy. We see these workshops as an important part of both raising awareness of the importance of ontologies and bringing together representatives of different standards committees and different SDOs working in this area to help support alignment and consistency."

International standards and conformity assessment are supporting efforts to achieve net-zero emissions targets and to build a sustainable future. \nThe IEC brings together a global institutional framework that enables a broad range of stakeholders from around the world to collaborate on technical solutions that reflect best practices. Their work helps to connect global economies, ensures the safety and well-being of citizens and builds trust in technology.\nIEC Standards are the culmination of a consensus-driven process based on clearly defined, transparent rules. A worldwide network of more than 20 000 experts works together to provide the technical foundation for effective solutions that can help to mitigate the impact of climate change, as well as build the necessary resilience to withstand its consequences.\nConformity assessment\nIn addition to developing and publishing standards, the IEC administers the only globally standardized approach to testing and certification. The four global IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems bring together certification bodies and testing laboratories in up to 54 countries.\nAmong other things, they allow public and private stakeholders to verify and certify safety, quality and interoperability. In this context, IECQ has created a new working group that aims to address CA needs related to environmental certification, including Eco design (circular economy), impact verification of products or services, environmental footprint, environmental performance, and others.\nIECRE, meanwhile, is specifically designed for renewable energy systems. It provides third-party certification of equipment and services in the solar, wind, and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and performance.\nSafety, security and efficiency\n\nIEC work helps to strengthen the robustness of critical infrastructure, such as the electricity grid, through built-in safety mechanisms, processes and minimum requirements. It promotes the safe and efficient use of renewable energy, whether integrated into the grid or installed off-grid to allow remote communities to access electricity. \nIEC work integrates the circular economy practices of reducing and eliminating waste through intelligent design, material efficiency and recycling, without compromising the continued safety and performance of systems and devices. The IEC supports energy efficiency measures by providing globally relevant performance measurements, advocating for the dissemination and promotion of energy-efficient technologies and defining minimum energy performance requirements, as well as quantifying greenhouse gas emissions \nCollaboration with others\nThe IEC collaborates with ISO to accelerate climate action. Together the two organizations have collected case histories demonstrating the use of standards for regulations. \nA joint IEC and ISO Climate action kit and a dedicated website provide regulators with real-life examples for enacting public policies that influence climate change initiatives. \nRead more\nClimate action\nUnderpinning sustainable development (IEC and the UN SDGs)"

        "abstract": "Semiconductors are the key elements for the majority of electronic systems. They have given us transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, solar cells and silicon chips.",
        "content": "The IEC Electropedia defines a semiconductor as a “substance the conductivity of which due to charge carriers of both signs is normally in the range between that of conductors and insulating media and in which the volumic numbers of charge carriers can be changed by external means.” \nThey are vital and costly components of modern technology, from smartphones to hypersonic aircraft and refrigerators to pacemakers. As the world becomes more digital, there has been a huge upsurge in demand for semiconductors. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues contributed to global shortages. As a result, goods ranging from new cars to video doorbells are either in short supply or more expensive. \nThat is because semiconductors are integral to anything containing electronics. They are used in diodes, integrated circuits, solar cells and silicon chips, for example.\nThe recent shortages are why the United States and the European Union have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in semiconductor production. At the moment, the vast majority are produced in Asia.  \nHow does the IEC help?\nIEC Technical Committee 47, Semiconductor devices, prepares international standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of discrete semiconductor devices.  TC 47 develops the IEC 60747 and IEC 62047series of standards for semiconductors.  \nIEC TC 86, Fibre optics, is responsible for the IEC 61290, IEC 61291, and IEC 61292 series.\nSince the properties of semiconductors are related to the devices where they will be used, different standards address, for example, switchgear and controlgear, converters, and X-ray machines. This means that the standards that apply to the design and test methods for the device also address semiconductor requirements.\nOther TCs with semiconductor requirements include:\n\n\nIEC TC 22, Power electronic systems and equipment\n\n\nIEC TC 40, Capacitors and resistors for electronic equipment\n\n\nIEC TC 82, Solar photovoltaic energy systems\n\n\nISO/IEC JTC1, the joint technical committee on information technology established by IEC and ISO\n\n\nIEC International Standards, together with the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components (IECQ), offer a unique solution to manufacturers, suppliers and buyers of semiconductors or devices using semiconductors. It is a one-stop shop that provides specifications for the design of products that can then be tested and certified by IECQ.\nIECQ ensures the quality, safety and reliability of all electronic components, monitors and tests the use of hazardous substances in electronic equipment and provides assessment and certification for facilities that handle unprotected ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive devices.\nManufacturers using electronic components and semiconductors, or processes related to electronic components covered by IECQ certificates have the assurance that their products will perform as designed and removes the need for prolonged performance testing of componentry and sub-assemblies."

        "content": "Scientists at the MIT have developed an adhesive ultrasound patch that is the size of a postage stamp. Patients will be able to go about their daily lives while the wearable patch scans their internal organs, blood vessels or digestive system. \nCurrently, ultrasound imaging requires large machines that look like desktop computers and can only provide snapshots of a patient’s health. In contrast, the small patch works for 48 hours in order to provide doctors with more detailed information.\n\nThe new device benefits from recent advances in miniaturization. In this context, it can be seen as part of a wider trend towards monitoring that can be used for both hospital inpatient supervision as well as part of outpatient care.\nFor instance, electronic thin patches are being used to help manage diabetes or applied to the skin in order to continually monitor glucose levels and, in some cases, can pump insulin into the bloodstream. \nRole of standards\nIn March 2017, the IEC set up Technical Committee 124 (TC 124) with the aim of providing standards in the field of wearable electronic devices and technologies which includes materials and devices that are patchable, implantable, ingestible as well as those made from electronic textile materials.\nAccording to Jae Yeong Park, Secretary to IEC TC 124, “The business environment of wearable technologies is rapidly expanding on a global basis, and we see the emergence of new markets and applications. Already, more than four thousand companies, including all major electronics multinationals, are developing wearable electronic devices and technologies for the global market.”\nThe standardization of wearable technologies is still in its early phases. However, according to Park, “There is a common agreement that only international standardization can reduce the cost and effort for early industrialization and provide effective guidelines towards stabilization and expansion of the market.”\nRecent publications\nIn 2021, IEC TC 124 issued its first publications consisting of three international standards and one technical report. IEC 63203-101-1 provides definitions to the vocabulary frequently used in relation to wearable technologies thus ensuring a common basis for the discussion of key concepts while IEC 63203-201-3 and IEC 63203-204-1, provide test methods related to e-textiles.\nE-textiles are well suited to monitor biological signals such as respiratory rates and cardiac signals. Alongside the e-textiles, a detachable electronic device needs to be connected in order to measure the information from the e-textile. Currently, no standardized connection interface exists between the electronic device and the e-textile although the conductive snap fasteners are the most commonly used. With IEC TR 63203-250-1, IEC TC 124 has provided a review of conductive snap fastener connectors and provides guidance for future standardization work regarding e-textile connectors."

        "content": "Fingerprints are a common form of biometric authentication and have been used by police forces around the world for more than 100 years to solve crimes. A British colonial magistrate in India is credited with the first official modern use of fingerprinting, on 28th July 1858.\nThat date was when Sir William Herschel began demanding fingerprints on civil contracts as a way of preventing signees from repudiating their signatures. It took another 34 years for an investigator in Buenos Aires to pioneer the use of fingerprint identification, known as dactyloscopy, to arrest a criminal. \nNowadays, fingerprints and other biometrics are found in all areas of life. Fingerprints have become a quick way to open smartphones and other consumer devices.\n\nBiometrics are used in airports and border control systems. Facial recognition scans identify nationals and allow them to leave one country and enter another.\nIn other situations, this technology can open doors and give approved users access to high-level security areas. In homes, voice recognition is used to control heating, lighting and entertainment systems, and many of us use it to do rapid information searches.\nBiometric security offers a number of benefits. It is not only fast and convenient but also almost impossible to replicate.  \nBut just as passwords can be stolen, fingerprints and other biometric markers are also vulnerable to thieves for so-called ‘presentation attacks’. Unlike passwords, however, they cannot be changed, giving cybercriminals permanent access to any computer or electronic device requiring biometric authentication.\nInternational standards offer guidance based on industry best practices. Much of the work is carried out in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 develops publications related to biometric technologies for cards and personal identification. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 focuses on cyber security, including biometric data protection techniques, biometric security testing, evaluations, and evaluation methodologies.\nThe standardization of generic biometric technologies to support interoperability and data interchange among applications and systems takes place in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37.\nAn SC 37 Technical Report provides guidance on estimating how \"challenging\" or \"stressing\" is an evaluation dataset for fingerprint recognition, based on relative sample quality, relative rotation, deformation, and overlap between impressions. In addition, it establishes a method for the construction of datasets of different levels of difficulty, as well as defining the relative level of difficulty of a fingerprint dataset used in the technology-related evaluation of fingerprint recognition algorithms."

        "content": "Sales of electric vehicles are continuing to soar following record sales in 2021. Analysts are predicting that EVs could achieve 33% of the global vehicle market by 2028 and over 50% by 2035. \nBattery-powered vehicles account for more than 10% of new cars sold in Europe and around 20% in China. The United States is also seeing record EV sales, with 5% of new vehicles powered only by electricity.\nAll this is good news for the environment and the fight against global warming. Petrol vehicles currently account for 25% of total CO2 emissions in the world, making them the second largest carbon emitters.\nMaking transport more sustainable will be essential to achieving six of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations in its blueprint for building a better world by 2030. \nEVs are clean at the point of use and are also several times more efficient at converting energy into propulsion than gasoline or diesel combustion engines. IEC Standards and conformity assessment are essential in enabling them to be safe and performance-driven, as well as energy efficient.\n\nSeveral IEC technical committees have developed the foundation for the integration of transportation within energy systems. IEC TC 57 publishes the IEC 61850 standards, a foundational series of publications that pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. \nThey deal with issues such as the integration of renewable energies and EVs within the electrical network. The standards developed in the IEC 62196 series, specify the requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets to interface between the EV and the EV charging system. \nA new edition of the first part of IEC 62196 has now been published. IEC 62196-1, Plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors and vehicle inlets – Conductive charging of electric vehicles – Part 1: General requirements, describes the interface between the electric vehicle and the charging station and defines the requirements and test methods for the accessories used. \nThe concept of medium-range wireless power transfer (WPT), achieved using near-field electromagnetic coupling, has existed since the pioneering work of Nikola Tesla more than a century ago.\nIn a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electricity from a power source, generates a time-varying electromagnetic field that transmits power across space to a receiver device. This extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load.\nFor medium-range applications, such as EV charging, inductive WPT systems have generally been preferred. They use magnetic field coupling between conducting coils embedded in the roadway and the vehicle. \nIEC TC 69 publishes several standards including IEC 61980-1, which specifies the general requirements for EV WPT systems. \nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) has also launched a specific programme for EVs through its registered certification body testing laboratories (CBTLs) and national certification bodies (NCBs). They can test and certify charging systems and stations and plugs against IEC Standards."

The stresses can be endured during the transport itself but also during the handling, packing and storing of the goods.\nPhotovoltaic modules are no exception: they require to be handled with care and measures need to be taken to ensure safe and efficient delivery.\nTests need to be carried out before transport to ensure that the modules can resist to different levels of stress and that their electrical properties remain unaffected. These tests are specified in IEC 62759-1 and are expected, for instance, to simulate road transportation and shipping through random vibration and various shock tests on the complete package system of modules. \nThe new edition of IEC 62759-1 includes significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition published in 2015, including the deletion of the requirement for a minimum of 10 modules per shipping unit.\n“We revised the standard quite substantially, for instance concerning the requirements for retesting,” says Franz Klein-Koenigsfeld from TUV Rheinland, who helped drive the standardization project.\nIEC 62759-1:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented version.

The European Union has asked all its members to make energy efficiency a priority, with the aim of reducing energy consumption by 15% in each country before the winter. \nWhile the immediate aim is to be able to increase the EU’s energy independence, in the longer run this will also help to achieve the net zero by 2050 emissions target. Consumers are asked to switch off lights and non-essential electronic devices, lower their heating and air-conditioning consumption and generally adapt their lifestyles to using less energy.\nThe same is demanded of big companies and industry.  \nEnergy efficiency and the IEC\nIEC has long put energy efficiency at the centre of its standards development process. This starts by agreeing on a definition of the concept: energy efficiency is defined as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy.\nThis can be done in three different ways: using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for a better performance, or improving the conversion of energy into electricity. Standards also help to help to disseminate and promote energy efficiency technologies and set minimum energy performance requirements.\n\nThe IEC has set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) to help IEC technical committees adopt energy-efficient solutions in their standardization activity and support energy-efficient technologies through their standards. According to ACEE Chair Philippe Vollet, “our first mission is to coordinate activities related to energy efficiency and provide guidance to technical committees”.\nIEC ACEE has developed two guides, Guide 118 and Guide 119, which can be used by IEC technical committees to harmonize energy efficiency standardization and adopt a systems approach."

        "published_day": "2022-07-20",
        "abstract": "World Drowning Prevention day is on 25 July. IEC Standards help to maintain essential services during floods, which are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change.",
        "content": "According to the UN, every year an estimated 236,000 people drown, making drowning a major public health problem worldwide. Drowning is one of the leading causes of death globally for children and young people aged 1-24 years. Drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths. \nThe global burden of death from drowning is felt in all economies and regions, however low- and middle-income countries account for over 90% of unintentional drowning deaths.\nOne of the reasons for this is the impact of floods, which have been increasing in frequency and in intensity as a result of global warming. Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and destroying more than seven million homes. Bangladesh is considered one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, and the poor are disproportionately impacted by the effects of such disasters.\nWhile using renewable energies everwhere will reduce CO2 emissions and eventually reduce the potential for global warming, resilience to disasters such as flooding or other severe wheather episodes is crucial.\nA more resilient grid\nMaintaining electricity services during such events saves lives by enabling essential services, such as hospitals, to continue working. Making existing grids more resilient is one of the answers: using waterproof technology that will resist floods, burying electrical lines underground to avoid fires, etc. These can and are envisaged but are expensive and financing them remains an issue in many countries around the world. Many IEC Standards help to strengthen the disaster resilience of the electricity grid through built-in safety mechanisms, processes and minimum requirements. They also ensure a level playing field, bringing the cost down for manufacturers and utilities.\nRelying on DERs is one of the great other ways of ensuring electricity continues to be supplied when grids fail. DERs are everywhere: a DER can be a solar panel on the roof of a building, a microgrid or a wind turbine but it can also be an electric vehicle plugging into the electricity mains or even a fridge, which has a controllable load. DERs are not only distributed sources of energy, they are also controllable consumers of energy.\nWhile the general perception is that the installation of solar panels or small wind turbines effectively takes homes “off the grid”, this is generally not true, especially in developed nations, as DERs are connected to the grid and send excess electricity back to the utility network. However, there are ways to tap renewable energy systems that are connected to the network in the event of a grid collapse after a weather event. A special inverter connected to a battery can enable buildings to island or isolate themselves from the grid, as they continue to produce and store power.\nDERs often combine renewable energy installations such as rooftop solar modules, small wind turbines or small hydro with a battery or a generator to form a microgrid or a minigrid. Microgrids are used by small residential or commercial consumers. Minigrids are larger configurations, which can power large commercial outlets, universities, factories, cities and even islands.\nThe Japanese example\nJapan is regularly exposed to extreme weather situations as well as frequent earthquakes. Even before the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country had invested in microgrid technology which enabled it to better face the huge challenges caused by the earthquake and resulting tsunami.\nThe Japanese city of Sendai used its microgrid to maintain essential services such as electricity, telecommunications and water to hospitals, retirement homes and other structures, immediately after the 2011 earthquake. Since the gas network in the city remained intact, gas engine generators were able to function as the main power supply to the microgrid.\nIEC Standards for microgrids and resilience\nIEC TC 8 publishes several documents which specify the design and management of microgrids. One of its subcommittees, SC 8 B, publishes IEC 62898-2, for instance, which supplies guidelines for the operation of microgrids.\nThe IEC 61850 standards are a foundational series of publications which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They deal with issues such as the integration of renewable energies and DERs within the electrical network but also increased automatization and self-healing processes.\nLow voltage direct current (LVDC) is one of the technologies particularly relevant for rural electrification. Today's electronic and battery-driven devices, including mobile phones, all use direct current (DC). Since power generated using the sun, wind, or water is DC, LVDC can be used to directly power lighting and household devices in rural and remote settings in a particularly energy efficient way. The IEC systems committee for LVDC, SyC LVDC is coordinating the work of all relevant TCs to make this technology safe, reliable and affordable.  It has just published its first key standard, IEC 63318, which helps remote communities gain access to electricity by linking them to on or off-grid solar or wind-based energy system."

        "content": "Two new foundational standards for artificial intelligence will provide important building blocks for digital transformation. ISO/IEC 22989 covers AI concepts and terminology, and ISO/IEC 23053 describes a generic framework for using machine learning (ML) technology.\nISO/IEC 22989 establishes terminology and describes concepts related to AI systems, which covers a wide range of technologies. The use of different terminology to describe the same concepts, processes, or technologies, or the use of the same terminology to describe different concepts, processes, or technologies, for example, can be a major barrier to responsible adoption, broad adoption, collaboration, regulation, and information sharing.\nThe new publication contains over 100 commonly used terms in AI such as transparency, explainability, controllability, bias, dataset, test data, validation data, and trained model. It is designed to improve the effectiveness of information exchange by helping standardization experts to draft standards that are consistent in terms of terminology.\nIn addition, this new publication provides key concepts, such as AI system lifecycle, AI stakeholder roles and AI functional overview, which can be used as the basis for experts developing interoperable and coherent applications, systems, standards, and/or usage guidelines for the application of AI.\nFramework for AI systems using ML\nThe ML framework in ISO/IEC 23053 explains the system components and their functions in the AI ecosystem. ML is a type of AI that employs computational techniques to enable a device to learn from data and experiences to improve its performance of a specific task or to make more accurate predictions about outcomes.\nThe standard is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations, including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit organizations, that are implementing or using AI systems. In conjunction with ISO/IEC 22989, ISO/IEC 23053 establishes common terminology and a common set of concepts for ML systems. In this way, it provides a basis for a clear explanation of the systems and various considerations that apply to their engineering and to their use.\nSC 42 — a forum for innovation\nISO/IEC 23053 and ISO/IEC 22989 are the work of the IEC and ISO joint technical committee (SC 42) that develops international standards for AI. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, as well as ethical and societal concerns.\n \nRead more in e-tech\nFoundational building blocks for AI systems"

        "content": "Regulations on how to dispose of products are getting tighter every day. This led the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components to set up a solution for manufacturers wanting to safely produce and dispose of their products: the IECQ hazardous substance process management (HSPM) scheme.\nDeveloping countries have been a dumping ground for electrical and electronic equipment originating in industrialized countries. Despite the Basel Convention, an international treaty to reduce the transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries, only 17,4%  of e-waste generated worldwide is collected and treated in a way that is environmentally sound (Global E-waste Monitor 2020).\nThis raises questions on the remaining 82,6%: how are goods treated when they reach their destination? In theory, the goods are repaired in the destination country and resold as second-hand equipment. In reality, especially for smartphones, tablets or computers, they are stripped of their valuable components before being dumped in a landfill.\nSwitzerland and Ghana made a proposal for the modification of the Basel Convention so that all electric and electronic waste shipped across borders gets prior consent from the destination country. Currently, according to the Basel Convention, e-waste classified as hazardous that goes to another country is checked but that doesn’t apply to non-hazardous e-waste.\nWhile dismantling electronic products, handlers might be exposed to toxic elements. This is especially dangerous in case of malfunction or defective components that may provoke exposure to harmful materials and cause injuries and illnesses.\nLegislation to restrict the use of hazardous substances\nIn an effort to address the issue, the EU introduced relevant legislation to restrict the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) and on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). REACH aim is to improve the protection of human and environmental health through better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. \nMany industrial countries around the world, have followed suit and established their own legislation. Programmes also exist that allow manufacturers and suppliers of the electronic components used in all modern devices to ensure that their products have extremely limited amounts of hazardous substances or are hazardous substance-free.\nThe IECQ hazardous substance process management (HSPM) scheme for example helps manufacturers and suppliers who want to produce and distribute hazardous substance-free (HSF) electronic components. It gives suppliers the means of demonstrating, through third-party assessment, that their electrical and electronic components and assemblies meet specific hazardous substance-free local, national and international requirements.\nRead the full article on etech"

        "abstract": "International standards and conformity assessment ensure safety, security, and interoperability in smart factories.",
        "content": "Gartner defines smart manufacturing as “the notion of orchestrating physical and digital processes within factories and across other supply chain functions to optimize current and future supply and demand requirements”. Smart manufacturing covers the whole value chain and life cycle of a product, from concept, research and design to production, marketing and distribution, as well as eventual retirement and recycling. \nIt is a technology-driven approach that achieves efficiencies by integrating data from multiple technical systems across domains, hierarchies and geographic boundaries. The Industrial Internet of Things is making all of this possible by accelerating the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) into cyber-physical systems. \nThe IIoT enables factories to connect machinery to an array of sensors and monitors that gather, analyze and communicate data with other devices and systems with the aim of improving quality and consistency.\nInternet of Things\nThe IEC and ISO Joint Technical Committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1, prepares international standards for information and communication technologies related to business and consumer applications. In 2016, JTC 1 created Subcommittee (SC) 41 to produce standards for the IoT.\n\nFor example, the IoT reference architecture standard, ISO/IEC 30141, establishes an all-encompassing framework for IoT, which serves as a basis from which to develop context-specific IoT architectures and actual systems.\nInteroperability\nThe IEC develops a large number of international standards that ensure these new technologies are safe and reliable as well as interoperable. For instance, IEC Technical Committee 47 prepares international standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of sensors.\nCore technologies such as digital twins — virtual replicas of physical objects and systems – rely on an efficient exchange of data between different departments, factories and even enterprises. IEC 62832 addresses the challenge by providing a common reference for the digitization of data related to production systems. \nThe standard for the Digital Factory framework sets out common rules for utilizing data based on computer-understandable data attributes and classifications.\nSafety\nSafety is defined as the freedom from unacceptable risk of physical injury, and it is an integral aspect of all IEC work.\nIEC safety standards for smart manufacturing include the functional safety standards IEC 61508, for electrical and electronic safety-related systems, and IEC 61511, which addresses safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector.\nIEC 62061 provides an approach to reducing the potential hazards generated by machines.\nCyber security\nIEC 62443 provides guidance on protecting cyber-physical systems from cyber-attacks. It addresses not only the technology that comprises a control system, but also the work processes, countermeasures, and employees. \nIEC 62443 takes a holistic approach because not all risks are technology-based: all employees must have the required training, knowledge and skills to ensure security.\nConformity assessment\nIEC conformity assessment ensuring that standards are properly implemented: for example, IECEE for IEC 61508 and IECEx for IEC 61511.\nIECQ conformity assessment helps to ensure that electronic components must be accurate, reliable and high quality because defective components can have serious consequences for humans and their environment.\nIn addition, IECQ certificates are used worldwide as a tool to monitor and control the manufacturing supply chain, thus helping to reduce costs and time to market, and eliminating the need for multiple re-assessments of suppliers."

        "content": "Geothermal energy is one of the renewable sources of electricity, which, unlike sun or wind, is not fluctuating in relation to the weather forecast. The source of geothermal energy is the continuous heat flux flowing from the interior of the earth towards its surface.\nGeothermal power plants pipe hot water or steam through wells that sometimes reach deep down to reservoirs underground. The thermal energy is then converted into electricity using different technologies.\nThe geothermal resources of the earth are clean and plentiful. This form of energy is available throughout the year, has an inherent storage capability and is independent of weather conditions.\nLike hydropower, geothermal energy provides storage capability, making it an ideal stabilizing energy, which can compensate for the fluctuating nature of other forms of renewable energy. Underground thermal energy storage systems store energy by pumping heat into an underground space. \nThermal energy can be stored in boreholes, aquifers and caverns or pits. The storage medium is water but can also be molten salts, soil and rocks. Boreholes are man-made vertical heat exchangers that work to transfer heat between the energy carrier and the ground layers.\nSome regions of the world rely extensively on geothermal energy to meet their requirements, ranging from Iceland to Turkey.\nTotal revision of 1990 standard \nThe technology used to produce geothermal energy must meet proper safety and performance benchmarks. IEC International Standards ensure that systems and devices employed are tested and meet the appropriate standards of quality and efficiency.\nIEC 60953 is published by IEC Technical Committee 5, which prepares standards for the rating and testing of steam turbines. It is a key document awaited by manufacturers and purchasers of steam turbines, for instance, thermal power plants, steam turbine designers and performance test engineers, to name but a few.\n“The continuing development of measuring techniques, the increasing capacity of steam turbines and growing variety of steam turbine configurations has prompted a revision of IEC 60953:1990,” explains one of the experts of IEC TC 5.\nThe tests specified in the standard concern flow and ageing of turbines, measured notably through the enthalpy drop tests.\nThis test involves a minimum number of instruments but establishes the efficiency of those turbine sections most susceptible to deterioration. Low enthalpy drop means high mass flow and high volumetric flow."

This new version will enable IEC National Committees to use the platform for the collection, consolidation, and submission of their comments to draft standards. The new version also offers enhancements to the user interface.\n“We are excited to be able to bring IEC NCs into the OSD platform. The launch of member commenting brings us one step closer to an end-to-end, fully digital standards development process that benefits from a collaborative, online environment,” notes Anja Bielfeld, IEC Business Analyst, who manages the OSD programme.\nTwo pilot projects\nThe member commenting features on the OSD platform are available for two pilot projects that already are or will soon be at the Committee Draft for comments (CD) stage:\n\nIEC 60512-28-100 ED3 prepared by IEC SC 48B\nIEC TS 62600-200 ED2 prepared by IEC TC 114 \n\nBoth projects have been developed using the OSD platform.\n\nBenefits of online member commenting\nThe OSD member commenting simplifies the process for IEC members to collect and provide feedback during the standards development commenting stages. It aims to enhance collaborative work and consensus building while also increasing efficiency. \nBecause the member commenting process is handled online, National Committees no longer need to manage multiple documents or complete separate forms. They benefit from a secure environment that allows experts to make their comments directly in the context of the draft standard. New tools are available, such as comment grouping as well as tagging and filtering. \nAccording to Sei-Yun Park El-Darwish, IEC NC Business Owner, “With member commenting on the OSD platform, members are able to streamline the process for collecting comments from their experts and developing their national position for draft standards.”\nOSD member commenting process\nThe IEC Secretariat disseminates the link to the CD document once the ballot opens. \nThe National Committee Admin (NCA) is responsible for providing access and permission to national mirror committee experts. These national mirror committee experts, representing national stakeholders, are invited to provide their comments. They can access the platform using their existing IEC credentials or an external authentication system.\nThe NCA consolidates and resolves comments received from their national experts. These comments are submitted to the IEC Secretariat as the national position. Depending upon the arrangement within an IEC NC, this role may be administered by a National Mirror Committee Secretary.\nUI enhancements\nIn addition to the launch of member commenting on the OSD platform, a number of user interface (UI) enhancements have been made. They include:\n\nnavigation menu is now on the left side of the draft\ntrack changes, Comments & Proposals, and Quality Check options available in a collapsible and expandable toolbar\nnew comments resolution tab available for Project Leaders\nmanage comments dashboard can be accessed from a button on the top menu bar\nnew widget in the Manage comments dashboard to display the number of comments per country (only visible at committee stage)\n\nCommenting and comment resolution enhancements have also been made for IEC standards developers.   \nAbout the OSD platform\n\nThe Online Standards Development (OSD) platform is a joint IEC and ISO project that provides standards developers with new digital tools to streamline the process of drafting and editing international standards. The platform enhances efficiency and collaboration throughout the process, from the preparation of a standard to its final publication."

        "published_day": "2022-07-06",
        "abstract": "In a recently released report, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) has called on governments to accelerate the development of new hydropower capacity or risk missing global net zero targets.",
        "content": "According to the 2022 Hydropower Status Report, only 26 GW of new hydropower capacity was put into operation during 2021. This falls well short of the 45 GW that the International Energy Agency (IEA) says is required to meet net zero goals by 2050 and keep global temperature rises to 1,5°C.\nTo keep temperature rises to 2°C would require utilities to ramp up capacity to 30 GW annually. The development of sustainable hydropower, with its ability to provide both flexible and reliable power, is needed to support the growth of other renewable sources such as wind and solar, and to avoid reverting to the use of fossil fuels, such as coal.\nUnlike other renewables, hydropower is extensively used for electrical energy storage on a large scale, so-called pumped storage. Electricity is used to pump water into reservoirs at a higher altitude during periods of low energy demand.\nWhen demand is at its highest, the water is piped through turbines situated at lower altitudes and converted back into electricity. Pumped storage is also useful to control voltage levels and maintain power quality, for example when intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power are connected to the grid.\nComparing development by country, the report shows that China led the way in 2021, accounting for around 80% of the new global capacity. China is already the world leader for installed hydropower capacity with over 390 GW – more than three times the next largest country, Brazil. \nNotable projects that came online during 2021 include the 824 MW Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Generating Station, part of the Lower Churchill Project in Canada; the remaining 600 MW of capacity at Laos' 1,272 MW Nam Ou plant; Nepal’s 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi project; units 3 and 4 of Kameng Hydropower Station in India, adding 300 MW; and a 324 MW unit added at the Dnesiter pumped storage plant in Ukraine, raising the plant’s installed capacity to 1,296 MW.\nIn emerging countries, hydropower is providing a cost-effective way to expand electricity access. In advanced economies, however, the share of hydropower in electricity generation has been declining over recent years and plants are ageing.\nHow the IEC can help\nIEC TC 4 develops international standards which specify the design, manufacture, installation, testing, operation and maintenance of hydraulic machines including turbines, storage pumps and pump turbines. Such standards also serve as the basis for testing and certification of components, devices and systems. Its Chair, Pierre Maruzewski, explains how he perceives the challenges ahead:\n\"It is important to bring facilities that have been around for decades up to date, by replacing parts using the latest technologies: turbines have evolved a lot over recent years and can be adapted to different water flows and function at variable speeds, for instance. Climate change and environmental degradation have resulted in a reduction of water inflow at some hydropower plants, as well as a decrease in reservoir levels.\n\"Some hydropower plants suffer from water head reduction, together with a decrease in efficiency of energy conversion in hydro turbines. Variable speed turbines can be a more energy-efficient solution. Sensors and microprocessors perform better every year thanks to technology innovations.\n\"The aim is to improve the performance of installed facilities and make them more efficient. Automation is becoming increasingly important, together with the use of control commands and control command software.\"\nAmong the many standards published by the TC, the IEC 63132 series provide guidance for installation procedures of hydroelectric machines. These standards are very useful for countries wishing to install new hydro facilities and which have little or no prior knowledge of hydropower. \nThe TC released IEC 60545, the second edition of a standard initially published in 1976. The purpose of the document is to establish suitable procedures for the commissioning and operation of hydraulic machines and associated equipment.\nIt is also preparing a new standard on standardized technical specifications governing the fatigue of hydraulic turbine runners. This standard will be important to ensure hydraulic turbine runners last for as long as possible."

Consequently, repairing it is often more cost-effective than replacing it. This is why IECEx set up the IECEx certified facilities scheme, which assesses and certifies that organizations that provide services that deal with the installation, inspection or repair and overhaul of Ex equipment, such as Ex repair workshops, offer such services to the Ex industry, and do so according to the strict requirements of IEC International Standards: the IEC 60079-10 series, IEC 60079-14, IEC 60079-17 and IEC 60079-19.\nThe IECEx certified service facilities scheme provides Ex equipment users, regulators and the community with the confidence that Ex safety is maintained when Ex equipment is designed, selected, installed, inspected, repaired, overhauled, modified or reclaimed, over and after its working lifespan, by an IECEx certified service facility in accordance with this scheme.\nThe requirements of these standards are intended to ensure that explosion protection features designed and built into the Ex equipment are not compromised during any selection, design, installation, inspection, maintenance, repair, overhaul or reclamation processes.\nThe key element of the IECEx certified service facilities scheme is initial and periodic audits by an IECEx certification body that has been accepted and authorized to issue IECEx certificates to service facilities. The purpose of these management system and technical audits is to ensure that services offered and delivered under the banner of IECEx certification always continue to comply with IECEx requirements and those of the relevant IEC International Standards.\n\n\nA video is also available on the IECEx certified equipment scheme:\n\nThe videos on the IECEx certified equipment scheme (available with subtitles in 10 languages) and the IECEx certified service facilities scheme are also available on the IECEx website homepage: www.iecex.com/"

        "content": "Cities are places where people have gathered and created societies, these places may have been close to natural resources or were a convenient stop on a trading route.  Cities have evolved over time and today we are seeing these places and communities adapt and change. \nTwo major changes we see are in building greater resilience to climate change, this includes efforts to decarbonise, the second is to embrace new technology such as digital transformation to better understand our place and be able to manage it more efficiently for the benefit of all living things, to protect what we have for future generations.\nThe IEC Systems Committee on Smart Cities was formed in 2015, and has taken a system-based approach in developing standards for what is a complex, dynamic environment known as “systems-of-systems”.\nIt can be easy to create technical standards within a bubble or get caught up in delivering multi-year planned work only to realise it is no longer relevant or timely.\nTo counter this, the committee created an observatory and research group (AG 12).  It is scanning, tracking and mapping cities as they become more digitally connected to create data-driven insights and more sustainable.The findings will help shape current and future standards development work and we hope will encourage new communications channels and engagement with those these standards are designed to help.\nIn our first year, we have identified three communities we interact with, with specific questions to each audience as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCity Mayor and Executives\n\nSmart City Leaders and General Managers\nSmart City standards development committees\n\n\nSurvey link (estimated 6 minutes to complete)\nSurvey link (estimated 14 minutes to complete)\nSurvey link (estimated 6 minutes to complete)\n\n\n\n\nAbout your city or municipality (characteristics)\nStrategic insights (current issues, drivers, challenges)\nCity insights since 2020 (population change, resilience, use of digital transformation, governance, megatrends, productivity)\nCase studies or reports to share\n\n \n\n\n\nAbout your city or municipality (characteristics)\nSmart City Plans (resourcing, use of frameworks, opportunities, obstacles)\nCity insights since 2020 (issues, drivers, gaps, city government priorities, residual risks from digital, good practice examples)\nCase studies or reports to share\n\n\n\n\nStandards development and use (adopted, purchased) in your country\nCommittee participation\nTrends in cities\nBenefits and gaps in standards development\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWe will not present our findings as a ranking exercise.  We seek to classify each city or municipality to compare fairly, we are keen to understand the issues, opportunities, and best practices happening today and place characteristics that make it potentially harder or easier to transform.\nOur surveys are short and take less than 10 minutes to complete.  Most questions are short text or multiple-choice, with a very small number seeking longer text responses to allow us to capture some qualitative feedback.\nSurveys will close at the end of October.  Those that respond will get early access to the findings and if we see interesting outliers in the data, we will reach out to discuss why this may be so with the opportunities to include case studies.\nOn behalf of the IEC Smart Cities, I thank you for your support in either passing this message on to those the survey seeks feedback from, or from you as a survey respondent.\nThe general release of the report findings will be announced later this year."

        "content": "A new international standard helps organizations to address the security of all devices connected throughout their networks. ISO/IEC 27400:2022 provides guidelines on IoT-related risks, principles and controls for security and privacy.\nWikipedia defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as describing “physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks”. Thanks to billions of connected, sensorized devices and systems, it can facilitate everyday activities and tasks and improve the efficiency of work processes, which saves both time and money. \nMany of these devices are low cost with limited user interfaces and devoid of common security features. Often, they are designed to operate over a long period of time without software updates to mitigate security concerns. \nFrom the perspective of cyber security, it presents hackers with countless potential doorways to data breaches. Indeed, cyber-criminals often use port-crawling tools to pinpoint vulnerable devices in a network.  \nThey could be looking for work-related devices, such as printers, or seemingly innocuous appliances such as refrigerators or electronic door locks. In the case of a gang of hackers targeting a casino in North America, it was a fish tank.\nThe casino hackers were able to transfer 10 GB of data out of the network, via a smart thermostat and up to the cloud, including the bank account details of wealthy patrons. It is a good example of how cyber-attacks have crossed from the digital to the physical sphere as a result of the integration of physical and online systems in IoT networks.  \nThe crux of the matter is that when connected to a network, any device with weak security poses a risk to the whole organization. Security concerns range from weak password authentication to bug-infested and vulnerable software. \nThe authors of ISO/IEC 27400 point out that IoT systems present “particular challenges” for information security because they are highly distributed and involve a large number of diverse entities. This implies that there are a very large attack surface and a significant challenge for the information security management system (ISMS) to apply and maintain appropriate security controls across the whole system.\nPrivacy or personally identifiable information (PII) protection is a significant concern for some types of IoT systems. Where an IoT system acquires or uses PII, it is usually the case that there are laws and regulations that apply to the acquisition, storage and processing of PII. \nEven where regulations are not a concern, the handling of PII by an IoT system remains a reputational and trust concern for the organizations involved, for example, if the PII is stolen or is misused, potentially causing some form of harm to the people identified by the information.\nSecurity and privacy controls in this document are developed for stakeholders in an IoT system environment, to be utilized by each IoT stakeholder, throughout the IoT system life cycle.\nISO/IEC 27400 was developed by the IEC and ISO technical committee on information security, cyber security and privacy protection."

        "content": "Cyber-attacks on supply chains increased by more than 50% in 2021 with high-profile targets including Colonial Pipeline, Kaseya, and SolarWinds. An important addition to the ISO/IEC 27036 series specifies fundamental information security requirements to help organizations reduce risks related to supplier relationships. \nThe advice set out in ISO/IEC 27036-2:2022 on the requirements for supplier relationships is applicable to organizations of all types and sizes. It covers the procurement and supply of products and services, such as manufacturing or assembly, business process procurement, software and hardware components, knowledge process procurement, build-operate-transfer and cloud computing services.\nAccording to ISO/IEC 27036-2, the cyber security risks are caused by mutual access to the other party’s assets, such as information and information systems, along with the difference in business objectives and information security approaches. The international standard stresses that these risks should be managed by organizations all along the supply chain.\nIt identifies the information security requirements for defining, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving supplier and acquirer relationships. The standard facilitates mutual understanding of the other party’s approach to information security and tolerance for information security risks, as well as reflecting the complexity of managing risks that can have information security impacts in supplier and acquirer relationships. \nISO/IEC 27036-2:2022 is the second portion of the four-part standard ISO/IEC 27036, which together provide comprehensive guidance on supplier relationships, including supply chain and cloud service security:\n\nISO/IEC 27036-1, Cybersecurity — Supplier relationships — Part 1: Overview and concepts \nISO/IEC 27036-2, Cybersecurity — Supplier relationships — Part 2: Requirements\nISO/IEC 27036-3, Information technology — Security techniques — Information security for supplier relationships — Part 3: Guidelines for information and communication technology supply chain security\nISO/IEC 27036-4, Information technology — Security techniques — Information security for supplier relationships — Part 4: Guidelines for security of cloud services\n\n\nBusinesses rely on third-party vendors to acquire products and services, including cloud companies to store sensitive data. From a cyber security standpoint, as ISO/IEC 27036 points out, this introduces risks to both acquirers and suppliers. \nOrganizations must protect themselves against the consequences of supply chain attacks. Consensus-based international standards based on best practices and the insight of experts from all over the world offer guidance and advice that can be trusted.\nThe ISO/IEC 27036 standardsare developed by the IEC and ISO technical committee on information security, cyber security and privacy protection."

It can be described as an international consortium which aims to accelerate technological development in the field of marine energy.\nNot unlike wind and solar energy, the sea offers many other opportunities to generate renewable energy, through wave and tidal power. \nMany people working on the ENCORE project have built ties with the IEC and the IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Renewable Energy applications). This has quite naturally evolved from their contribution in the different IEC Technical Committee 114 working groups or through their position within a renewable energy testing laboratory or renewable energy certification body. IEC TC 114 prepares standards for marine energy, whether relating to wave, tidal or other water current converters.\nPreparing new talent\nOne of the main goals of the ENCORE project is to develop a strategy to bring future innovations to market faster. This includes the development of an education programme to train and prepare talent to further advance the industry, with input from various stakeholders including the IEC Academy.\nThe development of this education package was accomplished by working with the IECRE and IEC TC 114. Conformity assessment and the use of international standards are essential to the development of the industry and such topics are included in the following online courses.\nFor example, the course International Certification of Marine Energy Technology within the IECRE covers all essential aspects of conformity assessment and has been reviewed by experts from TC 114 and endorsed by IECRE Chair, Jonathan Colby.\nFor more information: https://academy.iec.ch/course/view.php?id=70\nThe direct links to the courses are:\n Course 1 - Introduction to Offshore Renewable Energy (deftiq.com/ore-c1)\nCourse 2 - Technology Development (deftiq.com/ore-c2)\nCourse 3 - Testing Marine Energy Converters (deftiq.com/ore-c3)\nCourse 5 - International certification of marine energy technology within IECRE (deftiq.com/ore-c5)\nCourse 7 - Environmental Impact (deftiq.com/ore-c7)"

The use of green hydrogen is now recognized as an important way to address the decarbonization of large energy consumers, such as industry and transport. As a result, an increasing number of countries across the globe are defining ambitious plans and strategies for the production, trade and use of green hydrogen. According to IRENA, for a successful implementation of national and international strategies relating to green hydrogen, it is of paramount importance to ensure that\n·     the technology and infrastructure used to produce and transport green hydrogen can be monitored, measured and validated that they perform as required; \n·      and that green hydrogen can be traded on a global scale, while ensuring the sustainability and safety of its production and its derivatives\nHow IRENA is contributing\nIRENA is developing a roadmap for the development of the QI to ensure the quality, sustainability, and safety in green hydrogen production and trade. IRENA will provide an analysis on the role of QI services as an instrument for a successful global production and use of green hydrogen and selected derivatives. The roadmap will provide the technical foundation and strategic orientation for national and global stakeholders for the analysis of the existing QI, and its development according to the main requirements of the green hydrogen sector. Furthermore, it will elaborate recommendations for the development of a national action plan to implement QI, and directions to move from the national level to the finalization of the global roadmap.\nDuring the day event, IRENA will present an overview of the ongoing project on QI for green hydrogen, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ - Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung) via the National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB - Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt).\nThe idea is to facilitate a dialogue between the global stakeholders on the topic of QI for green energy including policy makers, hydrogen industry, QI institutions, the development community and organizations like the IEC.."

        "abstract": "Digital twins are becoming an indispensable tool for utilities.",
        "content": "Digital twins in the energy sector are virtual – and often real-time – representations of the physical grid assets. Digital twins help utility companies improve planning and specifications, operational efficiency and personnel training. They also offer a way to stress-test important assets and systems in preparation for a wide range of scenarios, including severe weather episodes.\nDigital twins “are applied across different energy domains. That’s why IEC technical committee 57 set up standardized communication means and associated machine-level semantics for supporting the interoperations of these twins. These can be found in the IEC 61850 and IEC 61970 common information model (CIM) series of standards, which are foundational standards for the smart grid,” explains Laurent Guise, an expert from IEC TC 57 and one of the founders of the IEC Systems Committee on Smart Energy (SyC Smart Energy).\nAndrea Bonetti is a Senior Application Specialist for Relay Protection and IEC 61850 and an active member of TC 95 which prepares IEC Standards for measuring relays and  protection equipment. “Protection relays are sophisticated real-time computers that monitor the electrical quantities in the power system and utilize their protection algorithms to check if there is a power system fault in their area of responsibility. If there is a problem, they issue an order to the relevant circuit breaker, to disconnect the power supply and isolate the area affected by the electrical fault, protecting people as well as assets,” he explains.\nBonetti points out that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of the grid and acceptance of the use of digital technology in every domain related to the electricity network. “The use of digital twins allows testing activities to take place anywhere and anytime. While it will not totally replace on-site testing, it can significantly reduce physical testing, lower costs and contribute to an increased quality of the protection system,” he indicates.\nDifferent technical committees working together\nThe IEC SyC Smart Energy has recently set up a joint working group with ISO/IEC subcommittee (SC) 41, which prepares global standards for the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital twin. SC 41 is part of the joint technical committee, JTC 1, formed by IEC and ISO to develop information and communication Technology (ICT) standards for business and consumer applications.\nA similar joint working group was established between IEC TC 57 and SC 41 to find synergies for IoT applications in the distribution grid. According to François Coallier who chairs SC 41, “Our strategic approach is to generate foundational and horizontal standards, specifying the vocabulary, the reference architecture, interoperability and trustworthiness as related to the IoT and digital twin. A second part of the strategy is to systematically collect use cases across all application domains as well as elicit and document standardization requirements.”\nAmong the use cases, smart energy and smart grids are one of the key applications.\n “The energy sector can bring quite a lot of experience and knowledge to the table, notably on the topic of the semantic interoperability of digital twins,” says Laurent Guise.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

It is a way to measure quality infrastructure in a country and moreover its preparedness to tackle the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nInformation on the fitness of quality infrastructure to meet sustainable development needs will serve as a useful input to support policy processes and national implementation plans for achieving the SDGs, as well as the coordination of technical cooperation programmes, not just by UNIDO but also other implementing partners and development agencies worldwide.\nThe primary objective of the event is to officially launch the QI4SD Index, share some key results, insights and demonstrate the availability and usefulness of the index to the international community through the functionalities of the website. It will also endeavour to allow panellists from the International Network on Quality Infrastructure (INetQI) organizations who provided key data, inputs, extensive research and insights to provide some of their own interpretations of the results, their experiences of the role of their specific QI dimension (standards, metrology, accreditation, conformity assessment and policy, etc.) in contributing to the SDGs, and the relationship/correlation between different QI dimensions.\nAmong the panellists, David Hanlon, the Secretary of the Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) at the IEC, will explain how the IEC contributes to sustainable development and how it helps to aggregate quality infrastructure indicators which are useful for people and the planet.\n“Quality Infrastructure (QI) is essential to achieve many national and societal goals, including sustainable development. IEC is an important player in the QI space because it is active in both international standards development and international conformity assessment services. It is only together that standards and conformity assessment create value, by ensuring that requirements have actually been achieved,” he says."

        "content": "AI applications are driving digital transformation across a diverse range of industries, including energy, healthcare, smart manufacturing, transport and other strategic sectors that rely on IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment. AI technologies allow insights and analytics that go far beyond the capabilities of legacy analytic systems. \nIEC experts focus on sector-specific needs (vertical standards) and conformity assessment, while ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 brings together technology experts, as well as ethicists, lawyers, social scientists, and others to develop generic and foundational standards (horizontal standards). \nIn addition, IEC safety standards are an essential element of the framework for AI applications in power utilities and smart manufacturing. Examples include the functional safety standards IEC 61508, for electrical and electronic safety-related systems, and IEC 61511, which addresses safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector. \nIEC Conformity Assessment completes the process by ensuring that the standards are properly implemented, for example, IECEE for IEC 61508 and IECEx for IEC 61511.\nJoint IEC and ISO technical committee \nSC 42 is addressing some of the concerns about the usage and application of AI technologies. For example, data quality standards for machine learning and analytics are crucial for helping to ensure the applied technologies produce useful insights and eliminate faulty features. \nGovernance standards in AI and the business process framework for big data analytics address how the technologies can be governed and overseen from a management perspective. Concurrently developed standards from the outset in the areas of trustworthiness, ethics, and societal concerns will ensure responsible deployment.\nHardware \nThe IEC develops standards for many of the technologies that support AI. Sensors and cloud and edge computing are examples. \nAdvances in data acquisition systems are driving the growth of big data and AI use-cases. IEC TC 47 prepares standards relating to semiconductor devices, including sensors; IEC TC 65 focuses on sensors that are used in industrial processes; IEC TC 76 covers sensors that rely on lasers; IEC SC 86C deals with fibre optic sensors.\nWireless sensors that can run independently from any external power source, capturing energy from heat or movement are underpinned by IEC Standards prepared by IEC TC 49. Sensors can be certified under IECQ, IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, one of the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. \nCloud computing and its technologies have also supported the increase of AI applications. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 38 prepares standards for cloud computing including distributed platforms and edge devices, which are situated close to users and data collection points. The publications cover key requirements relating to data storage and recovery. \nBuilding trust \nInternational standards play an important role in increasing trust in AI and help support public and private decision-making, not least because they are developed by a broad range of stakeholders. This helps to ensure that IEC work strikes the right balance between the desire to deploy artificial intelligence and other new technologies rapidly and the need to study their ethical implications. \nThe IEC has been working with a wide range of international, regional and national organizations to develop new ways to bring stakeholders together to address the challenges of artificial intelligence. These include the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the standards development organizations, ISO and ITU. \nMore than 500 participants followed the AI with Trust conference (May 2022), in-person and online, to hear different stakeholder perspectives on the interplay between legislation, standards, and conformity assessment. They followed use-case sessions on healthcare, sensor technology and collaborative robots, and they heard distinguished experts exchange ideas on how they could interoperate more efficiently to build trust in AI. \nThe conference in Geneva was the first milestone of the AI with Trust initiative. \n \nFurther reading ­ \nIEC and ISO work on artificial intelligence ­ \nAI for the last mile ­ \nComputational approaches for AI systems ­ \nArtificial intelligence \n \nVideo ­ \nIan Oppermann at the AI with Trust international conference ­ \nAI with Trust international conference­ \nA governance framework for organizations deploying AI systems"

        "content": "Switchgear is essential part of an electric power system used to control, protect and isolate equipment. Should an electrical surge occur, a switchgear will activate and automatically interrupt the flow of electricity and thus protect the system from damage. They can also be used to disconnect equipment from the power supply to allow for the safe testing and maintenance of equipment.\nDifferent technologies exist to interrupt electric current including the use of a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) which uses a pressurized gas. Advantages of GIS include its relative low maintenance, low operating noise and lack of emissions thus making it suitable for use in confined spaces.\nTo ensure the performance and safety of gas-insulated switchgear used in high-voltage systems, the IEC has published a new edition of IEC 62271-203, High-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 203: AC gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear for rated voltages above 52 kV.\nThis standard specifies the performance and safety requirements for gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear in which the insulation is obtained, at least partly, by an insulating gas or gas mixture other than air at atmospheric pressure, for alternating current of rated voltages above 52 kV, for indoor and outdoor installation, and for service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz.\nAccording to Olav Knudsen who help lead the development of the latest edition of IEC 62271-203, “This is a key standard in the industry that not only provides essential safety and performance requirements but also guidance on design, installation and selection of switchgear and controlgear as well as the impact on the environment. With this new edition to IEC 62271-203, we have updated to align with the latest industry practices.”\nThe new edition of IEC 62271-203 provides several key changes compared to the previous edition. They include: \n\nalignment with IEC 62271-1:2017, High-voltage switchgear and controlgear - Part 1: Common specifications for alternating current switchgear and controlgear\nin addition to SF₆, alternative gases have been implemented \nthe terms and definitions have been improved and updated\ntightness requirements for SF6 and other gasses with high GWP (global warming potential) have been increased. \nupdates made to the sections on Gas and vacuum tightness, Corrosion test on earthing connections, and Corrosion tests on sealing systems of enclosures and auxiliary equipment \nImproved, updated guidance for service continuity requirements during maintenance, repair and extension of installed GIS has been added\n\nIEC 62271-203 has been prepared by IEC subcommittee 17C: Assemblies which is part of IEC TC 17 High-voltage switchgear and controlgear.\nA commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 62271-203 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition.

        "content": "Despite the giant leaps in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms trained on data gathered from sensors both inside and outside the car, the seemingly rapid advances to date may only prove to be the low hanging fruit. Cracking the last mile will be harder and take a lot longer.\n“It is the last 10% of cases and situations that is proving a bottleneck in development,” Matthew Avery, Director of Research at motor insurance industry funded researcher Thatcham Research was quoted as saying in the Guardian.\nThe bulk of rules for AVs such as following the line of the road, sticking to a certain side and avoiding crashing into other cars can be addressed by AI algorithms.\nBut it is far more difficult for algorithms to address what Avery refers to as “edge cases” – rare and unusual events that a self-driving vehicle has not encountered before. Examples might be a dog running into the road or an unexpected weather-related accident, for instance.\nCracking the last mile\nThere are five grades of automated vehicle systems as classified by the US-based Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). These range from functions which automate distance control to totally autonomous vehicles, which means there is no requirement for a driver even to be present behind the wheel. Level 5 AVs may even lack a steering wheel as well as accelerator and brake pedals. Passengers might use voice commands to select a location or control what TV show they want to watch in transit. Crucially, level 5 vehicles are meant to be able to operate on roads anywhere, not just in certain designated areas.\nProfessor Michael Felsberg, Head of Sweden’s Linköping University’s computer vision lab says several problems stand in the way of achieving such a goal. One of them is image classification. “We know that for each image, this is a bicycle, this is a dog and this is a car,” he explains. “The images are hand-labelled by humans and the annotated images are used to train image recognition systems.”\nFelsberg explains that AI algorithms require a period of supervised learning before a system can be deployed. In preparation for this phase, an army of annotators is needed to label the images for a given application. Images are annotated with not only the name of the class of objects the algorithm should look for, but also the location of the object within the image. \nFor large-scale industrial use of AI, this amount of annotation is impractical, Felsberg says. “For autonomous vehicles to work on a large scale, algorithms should be able to recognize new classes of objects without having to undergo another round of supervised training. It takes too much time and effort to re-label the huge volumes of data. It would be much better if the algorithm could learn to recognize the new class after it has been deployed.”\nResearchers have yet to come up with a robust and effective method for this process, which is referred to as ‘class incremental learning’.\nWhat the IEC can do\nSelf-driving vehicles use sensors, cameras, radars and in some cases laser imaging, detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology to gather the data required to run autonomously. Several standards have been developed that can help with autonomous transport. IEC TC 47 publishes IEC 62969, which specifies the general requirements of power interfaces for automotive vehicle sensors.\nIEC TC 100 issues several standards relating to multimedia systems in cars. One of its publications is IEC technical specification (TS) 63033,which specifies a model for generating the surrounding visual image of the drive monitoring system, which creates a composite 360° image from external cameras. This enables the correct positioning of a vehicle in relation to its surroundings, using input from a rear-view monitor for parking assistance as well as blind corner and bird’s eye monitors.\nRead the full article in e-tech."

She shares some of her insights on the IEC and SEK with us.\n\nAs a member of the IEC Board, are you aware that you are showing the way for many other women in governance?\nMy participation on the IEC Board as the only woman is not a sufficient sign of progress in my view, even if it is an encouraging step forward. Having said that, I really don’t think the IEC is averse to further change on that level. I think the problem originates from the base, as electrotechnology has always been very male dominated. In previous years, there were therefore very few chances for women to reach the top echelons of the IEC. But I am very encouraged to see a real shift in several technical committees which have many more women convenors and experts than only a few years ago. More and more women are becoming qualified to take part in leadership positions in the IEC. I am very confident that things are changing in a positive way.\nWhat do you particularly enjoy about your work on the IEC Board?\nI have always been keen to promote global and fair trade. That is what drives me the most on the Board: questions related to how this exceptional organization, which provides worldwide solutions to global problems, can contribute to build fair, equal and sustainable trade, as well as communality. That is really needed, especially in the current context, with nations finding it increasingly difficult to agree with one another. At the IEC, we agree on global standards, and everyone has a say at the table. We help to electrify the world and relieve poverty as well, and I really want to promote that. There are few organizations which manage to do that: provide consensus-based agreements, which really help the world to be a better place.\nWhat are the main challenges for SEK going forward?\nElectrification and digitalization. We have a tremendous challenge ahead of us, not only in Sweden but in the world, to move away from fossil fuels and use clean electricity everywhere and we believe we can help both at IEC and at SEK level. We must engage with digitalization as well, in a similar fashion to the whole standardization community. We need to find new revenue streams and capitalize on our knowledge to ensure we stay relevant. An issue that is more difficult to handle for a small National Committee like ours is the increased political interest in standards. Although it is good that legislators understand the importance of standards, it does generate more bureaucracy. There are more meetings and events we find we need to take part in, but as we have only 14 employees, it does stretch us a bit.\nRead the full interview in e-tech"

In a recent interview, the new Chair of IECEE, Steven Margis, discusses the role of the IECEE and areas for further development.\n \n\nLeveraging the strengths of IECEE\nAccording to Margis, the IECEE has a strong history of developing rules and procedures that ensure confidence in its resulting services.  “These governance materials have been developed and approved by our national Member Bodies that consist of diverse stakeholder interests balanced between conformity assessment organizations and industry.” \nWhile the strength of the IECEE is derived from the alignment between these interests, Margis points out that “it is further enhanced by additional stakeholders, such as regulators, who actively contribute to the objectives of the IECEE System.”\n \n\nNurturing the foundations\nThe IECEE System currently offers certification services to over 3 000 unique standards. Margis asserts that one of his main objectives, as IECEE Chair, will be to nurture the foundation that has already been built. However, he says that this includes driving efficiencies for change. “Any change has to go in lockstep with our well-established foundational rules and procedures.”\n \nEntering new markets\nWhile 173 countries participate in the work of the IEC as members and affiliates, not all are involved in the IECEE. According to Margis, “The challenge is to bring additional IEC countries into the IECEE System that are not yet participating. However, doing so requires engaging with local markets to ensure that they understand the value of the system and how it can contribute to their conformity assessment needs.”\nHe also adds that it is essential to have dialogue with national stakeholders about their standardization requirements. Affiliate countries offer opportunities to expand the IECEE community. “It is critical that we help these countries recognize how their participation and utilisation of IEC Standards provide value and help to optimise conformity assessment resources in their community.”\n \n\nPromoting diversity and inclusiveness\nDiversity and inclusiveness are essential for the future of the IECEE. While diversity of geography is already top of mind, Margis stresses that “when we have critical conversations, they need to be inclusive of stakeholders across geographies. It is in our interest to be diverse so that we hear the full voice of our members.”\n“We are successful because of the active engagement and contributions of our members. As we see a turnover of experts across the community due to many factors, we need to consider how we will continue to maintain a high level of engagement from our members while providing opportunities to onboard and introduce the next wave of experts,” Margis concludes.\nRead the full interview in e-tech."

        "content": "The recent plenary meeting of SC 42, the ISO/IEC artificial intelligence committee, offered many highlights. On the agenda was an overview of current work, which is focusing on topics as diverse as AI governance, algorithms and the ethics of AI, among others.  \nThe distinguished guest speaker was Gabriela Ramos, a senior official of UNESCO, the UN’s education, technology and science organization. As UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences, Ms. Ramos has overseen the development and adoption of the first global instrument to promote the ethics of AI.\nMs. Ramos told the SC 42 plenary meeting that AI and other new technologies should be used to address the major challenges in the world today, citing increased inequalities and the environmental crisis. Ms. Ramos said it was imperative that decisions impacting millions of people should be fair, transparent and contestable.\nIn 2021, UNESCO’s General Conference adopted a recommendation identifying common values and principles to guide the construction of a legal infrastructure to ensure the equitable and safe development of AI technologies. The Chair of the ISO/IEC AI committee, Wael Diab, is one of a broad range of experts who has participated in the UNESCO group led by Ms. Ramos on the implementation of the ethics recommendation.\nIt addresses issues such as inclusiveness and human rights, alongside, for example, concerns over bias, stereotyping, and discrimination in algorithms. Ms Ramos underscored the critical importance of developing a framework to support national and international policies that ensure that digital transformation benefits the whole of humanity. \nShe thanked the ISO/IEC for continuing to contribute their expertise and knowledge to the ongoing work. Mr Diab said the committee was honoured to participate, describing the collaboration as a natural partnership. \nMr. Diab said that the comprehensive approach of the ISO/IEC AI committee complemented UNESCO’s ambition to leverage AI technologies to build a just and fair future. “ISO/IEC standards address the entire AI ecosystem, from foundational concepts and data standards to reference architecture, use-case and application guidelines,” he continued. \n“Recent publications address topics such as computational approaches and AI governance. Coming shortly is an ISO/IEC Technical Report on ethics, closely followed by two important foundational standards, the first addressing AI concept and terminology and the second providing requirements and guidance for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an AI management system.\" \nOn a separate note, Mr. Diab announced the launch of a series of workshops aimed at creating an evolving roadmap for collaboration between a broad range of stakeholders. The ISO/IEC AI Workshops will explore the AI ecosystem from a diverse and broad set of perspectives. \nThe inaugural workshop, which took place on 24 and 25 May, concentrated on emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications, as well as the critical role that international standards play in enabling innovation and responsible adoption.\nMore than 260 participants from 50 countries took part in the plenary meeting.\n \n\nRelated content\nIEC and ISO work on artificial intelligence"

        "content": "IEC has published new commented editions of key IEC Standards on insulating liquids.\nDissolved and free gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools for detecting and evaluating faults in electrical equipment filled with insulating liquid. However, interpretation of DGA results is often complex and should always be done with care, involving experienced insulation maintenance personnel.\nA new commented version (CMV) of the IEC 60599 Standard has recently been published, which provides a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the most recent edition and the previous version of the publication. Comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content. IEC 60599 was developed to provide information for facilitating the interpretation of DGA results. Interpretation schemes are based on observations made after inspection of many faulty oil-filled equipment in service and concentrations levels deduced from analyses collected worldwide.\nThe main changes between this latest edition of IEC 60599 and the previous edition published in 2015 concern Annex A.5 (DGA interpretation in bushings) and Annex A.3 (DGA interpretation in wind-turbine transformers). Bushings are an insulating structure that facilitates the passage of an energized, current-carrying conductor through the grounded tank of the transformer. Ranges of typical values of hydrogen and of the other gases, observed recently in bushings by several large utilities, have been introduced in Annex A.5. These new typical values will help operators of bushings better evaluate their actual condition and faults in service.\nLikewise, ranges of typical values of hydrogen and of the other gases, observed recently in wind-turbine transformers by several large operators, have been introduced in Annex A.3. These new typical values will help operators of wind-turbine transformers better evaluate their actual condition and faults in service.\n“This new edition give recommendations and guidance but resulting action can only be undertaken with proper engineering judgment,” describes IEC TC 10 expert Michel Duval.\n\nNew CMV for IEC 60475\nThe TC also published another CMV of IEC 60475: Method of sampling insulating liquid, which contains both the official standard and its commented version.  “The standard is applicable to the sampling procedure used for insulating liquids in delivery containers and in electrical equipment such as power and instrument transformers, reactors, bushings, oil-filled cables, oil-filled tank-type capacitors, switchgear and load tap changers (LTCs),” says Duval.\nThe document applies to liquids the viscosity of which at the sampling temperature is less than 1 500 mm2/s (or cSt). It applies to mineral oils and non-mineral oils (such as synthetic esters, natural esters, vegetable oils or silicones). One of the main changes with the previous edition published in 2011 is the addition of a new Annex C on oil sampling from bushings."

These standards are designed to meet evolving industry, regulatory and consumer needs.\nIEC/IEEE 63195-1:2022 and IEC/IEEE 63195-2:2022 aim to provide a central platform for electric and magnetic fields (EMF) compliance testing of all 5G mmWave devices:\n\nIEC/IEEE 63195-1: Assessment of power density of human exposure to radio frequency fields from wireless devices in close proximity to the head and body (frequency range of 6 GHz to 300 GHz) - Part 1: Measurement procedure\nIEC/IEEE 63195-2: Assessment of power density of human exposure to radio frequency fields from wireless devices in close proximity to the head and body (frequency range of 6 GHz to 300 GHz) - Part 2: Computational procedure\n\n\n“The new 5G EMF standard is right at the core of the IEC vision – IEC everywhere for a safer, more efficient world – and demonstrates that the cutting-edge expertise of IEC TC 106 is fundamental to the safe deployment of 5G technology,” said IEC Secretary-General Philippe Metzger,\n\nWhat is 5G mmWave?\n5G mmWave (or millimetre wave) is an ultra-high frequency band in the millimetre wave range promising transmission speeds 100x faster than 4G LTE. This new cellular technology is one of the key elements of the 5G technology mix, benefiting mobile Wi-Fi, cellular backhaul, and home internet service.\nIt uses gigahertz (GHz) frequencies to enable faster data rates and lower latency in high-traffic, high-density scenarios. In cities, public transport hubs, and sports stadiums, 5G mmWave technology helps deliver on the full promise of 5G.\nWithin a few years, most 5G mobile devices will have mmWave capability and this is why an international standard is needed to tap into this new mmWave technology and help enable compliance with EMF safety limits.\nIEC/IEEE 63195: Matching 5G Technology with the Highest Safety Standards\nThe new IEC/IEEE 63195 standards for 5G EMF are intended to meet the fast-paced advances in mobile technology and help consumers feel confident that 5G technology is matched with the state-of-the-art EMF safety testing standards.\nA key feature of these standards is the advanced assessment of the mmWave power density, which is present right at the head and body when a 5G device is being used, to check on the exposure limits for power density specified by national and global health agencies.\nmmWave signals do not get absorbed in the human body the way the lower frequencies do. In fact, mmWave radiation penetrates only a few mm of the skin surface and does not reach the inner regions of the body. This is why more advanced testing standards, laboratory testing equipment, and mmWave testing probes are required for 5G mmWave devices.\nGathering experts from academia, industry, governments, and testing laboratories, standards development was first initiated as an IEC Technical Report in 2018 to reflect the state of the art of the available testing technologies. \nThis effort later continued as the development of IEC/IEEE 63195 standards to help enable the safety testing of the very first mmWave devices and trial systems. The standards deliver testing methods that cover computation and measurement for frequencies from 6GHz to 300GHz.\nAs technology evolves, experts from IEEE SA and IEC will continue their collaborative work to provide the most up-to-date assessment methods for future international standards.\nWe would like to acknowledge the significant effort from all experts of IEC TC106 and IEEE ICES TC34 involved in developing these new standards and especially the Co-Conveners Kai Niskala from Finland, John Roman from the US, Teruo Onishi from Japan, and Andreas Christ from Switzerland. \n\nRead more:\nIEC TC 106\nIEEE SA\nIEC Blog\ne-tech\nVideo\nMike Wood explains5G beamforming technology"

        "content": "The sustainability of transportation has come under increased scrutiny in recent years in view of its environmental impact. This very broad issue covers air, rail, road and sea systems for the transportation of goods and people.\n\nEach mode, purpose, source of energy and storage for transport rests on different technologies and often calls for distinctive solutions.\nReducing greenhouse gases in the shipping industry\nGlobal shipping is the lifeline of the world's economy, transporting over 80% of the volume of international trade in goods (UNCTAD). Nearly three quarters of ships currently use various types of fuel oils emitting different levels of greenhouse gases (GHG), which make shipping responsible for around 2% of global GHG emissions (IEA). \nOne solution to cut GHG emissions is to electrify the various aspects of shipping. A number of IEC technical committees are working towards this goal. For instance, to prevent or cut GHG emissions of ships in ports, high voltage shore connection and low voltage shore connection systems have been introduced relying on, respectively, IEC/ISO/IEEE 80005-1:2019 and IEC PAS 8005-3:2014. These were developed by IEC TC 18: Electrical installations of ships and of mobile and fixed offshore units. Other solutions exist, such as Norway’s Ampere ferry, equipped with lithium-ion batteries, which has been transporting cars and passengers across a six-kilometre stretch of water since 2015. \nStandards for electric road vehicles\nThe wide adoption of electric road vehicles (EVs) in developed economies is being promoted by incentives and mandatory adoption. It is also accelerated by advances in secondary batteries, essentially based on lithium-ion, but with new chemistries also being introduced. Charging requires an extensive infrastructure and standards are needed to ensure compatibility with charging stations.\nThe standards developed in the IEC 62196 series, specify the requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets to interface between the EV and the EV charging system. A new edition of the first part of IEC 62196 has now been published. IEC 62196-1, Plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors and vehicle inlets - Conductive charging of electric vehicles - Part 1: General requirements describes the interface between the electric vehicle and the charging station and defines the requirements and test methods for the accessories used. \n\nOther technologies like hydrogen and fuel cells are also being introduced in different countries. However, the production, transportation and distribution of hydrogen remains a challenge. The IEC develops International standards for fuel cells in IEC TC 105.\nGreener electricity generation and storage\nGreener transport modes and systems mean that the electrical energy they use must also come from greener sources. This requires the decarbonisation of electricity generation. In 2021, electricity generated by power plants burning fossil fuels made up 58% of the total, with 42% coming from renewable sources according to the IEA.\n\nThe IEC develops standards to ensure the safety, reliance and performance of renewable energy. This includes: \n\nIEC TC 4: Hydraulic turbines\nIEC TC 5: Steam  turbines\nIEC TC 82: Solar photovoltaic energy systems\nIEC TC 88: Wind energy generation systems\nIEC TC 114: Marine energy - Wave, tidal and other water current converters\nIEC TC 117: Solar thermal electric plants\n\nThe IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications (IECRE) facilitates international trade in equipment and services for use in the renewable energy sectors while maintaining the required level of safety.\nHowever, because the generation from renewable sources is often intermittent, storage is essential to ensure grid stability. International standards for secondary batteries, used also for energy storage, will be essential.\nThere is a clear need to move ahead and introduce greener, more sustainable transportation systems, which the application of international standards can facilitate."

Energy storage systems (ESS) will be essential in the transition towards decarbonization, offering the ability to efficiently store electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. However, standards are needed to ensure that these storage solutions are safe and reliable.\nTo ensure the safety and performance of batteries used in industrial applications, the IEC has published a new edition of IEC 62619, Secondary cells and batteries containing alkaline or other non-acid electrolytes - Safety requirements for secondary lithium cells and batteries, for use in industrial applications. \nIndustry, with its unique power requirements, uses batteries that focus on durability and reliability. IEC 62619 specifies requirements and tests for the safe production of secondary lithium cells and batteries used in industrial application. Batteries that fall within the scope of the standard include those used for stationary applications, such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), electrical energy storage system, as well as those that are used to produce motion, such as forklift trucks, automated guided vehicle (AGV) and railway and marine vehicles.\nAccording to Mr. Takefumi Inoue who helped lead the development of IEC 62619 in IEC SC21A WG5, “The safety of lithium secondary cells and battery systems requires the consideration of intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse. With this standard, battery systems are designed and constructed to ensure their safety under both of these conditions.”\nTest methods are defined for foreseeable misuses such as short circuits, overcharging, thermal abuse, as well as dropping and impact. IEC 62619 also addresses functional safety for battery management systems (BMS) based on IEC 61508. It includes testing requirements for voltage and current controls to prevent overcharging and overheating.\nCompared with the previous edition, the second edition of IEC 62619 includes the following technical changes:\n\nnew requirements for moving parts\naddition of requirements for hazardous live parts\naddition of requirements for battery system design\nnew requirements for system lock\nnew requirements for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)\naddition of procedure of propagation test by laser\n\nIEC 62619 only addresses the first life of cells and batteries and does not take into consideration their reuse or repurpose.\nA commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 62619 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition. It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

The announcement came at the end of the AI with Trust conference, which focused on the way that standardization experts and conformity assessors interoperate with regulators.\n“AI with trust needs to continue,” said the IEC Secretary-General, Philippe Metzger. “We do not want to lose this very strong engagement, and the enormous wisdom of the participants to this conference, both here in Geneva, and also online.” \nThe Deputy Director of the FDFA's Directorate of International Law, Roger Dubach, added, “There are too many issues to be tackled at the same time and you do not really know how deeply AI will affect society, or how fast it will happen. But you must start somewhere.”\nEarlier, Mr. Dubach had revealed that he was concerned about the lack of coordination or communication between the different international and national bodies developing rules for AI. They include frameworks for international law, national and regional regulations with international effect, and international standards.  \n“The same concerns and principles, especially the ethical ones, are discussed at many different levels and in many different fora, but with almost no interconnection and exchange amongst each other,” said Mr. Dubach.\nMore than 500 participants followed the AI with Trust conference, in-person and online, to hear different stakeholder perspectives on the interplay between legislation, standards and conformity assessment. They followed use-case sessions on healthcare, sensor technology and collaborative robots, and they heard distinguished experts exchange ideas on how they could interoperate more efficiently to build trust in AI.  \nThe conference in Geneva was the first milestone of the AI with Trust initiative. Later this month, SC 42, the IEC and ISO committee that develops standards for AI, will continue the conversation with an online workshop. \nSC 42 is hoping to attract attendees to the online event from a variety of backgrounds and experience with AI, ranging from technical experts and academics to business leaders and social scientists. The workshop will look at emerging trends, technology, requirements and applications, as well as the critical role that international standards play to enable innovation and responsible adoption.\nDistinguished speakers from across a variety of disciplines will explore the AI ecosystem from a diverse set of perspectives. They will discuss ongoing work in SC 42 and elsewhere to address ethical concerns, in addition to other societal and business requirements. \nThe IEC and ISO committee on AI brings together technology experts, as well as ethicists, lawyers, social scientists and others, to tackle topics such as trustworthiness, biases in algorithms, and data.  The ISO/IEC standards that they develop address the entire AI ecosystem, from foundational concepts and data standards to reference architecture, use-cases and application guidelines."

The SC is developing international standards for AI with the goal of accelerating responsible adoption across applications and sectors.\nEnabling intelligent insights  \nMany of the emerging products and services in the era of digital transformation rely on the ability to provide forward-looking insights based on the large amount of data being generated. The technologies on which SC 42 is working will facilitate such innovation:\n\n AI technologies will allow insights and analytics that go far beyond what legacy analytic systems could provide in terms of efficiency, speed, and applications that have yet to be envisioned. This is a radical departure from what analytic systems have traditionally been capable of.\nBig data technologies will streamline and, in many cases, enable analytics to be performed on massive data sets. This will be achieved by designing computer system architectures around how the data sets will be generated and used in a particular application, rather than applying the same computer system to an application regardless of what the data looks like in terms of its variety, volume, variability, and so on. (For more information on this section, read: enabling the digital transformation of industry)\n\nSC 42 is considering some of the concerns about the usage and application of these technologies. Data quality standards for machine learning and analytics are crucial for helping to ensure the applied technologies produce useful insights and eliminate faulty features. Governance standards in AI and the business process framework for big data analytics address how the technologies can be governed and overseen from a management perspective. Concurrently developed standards from the outset in the areas of trustworthiness, ethics, and societal concerns will ensure responsible deployment.\nTo register for the workshop: https://iec.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_LyosjPP-Q0WXoeGhyGqqqw"

        "content": "In the IEC, we are proud of our work to enable electricity to be generated, distributed, and used safely and efficiently around the world and to support the move to net zero. We also have an important role in standardising the electronics that are the foundation of so much of modern life.\nHowever, we are also realistic. Electricity and electronics are only of value because of what they enable. They are fundamental requirements of almost all of the systems which support the needs of people and cities, but they would be useless without quality management processes, effective use of data and the contribution of many other specialist technologies.\nTherefore, in order to develop the standards that the world needs, it is not enough for the IEC to focus on the narrow requirements related to each specific electrical or electronic component. It is equally important for technical committees to understand the systems within which that component is used and the way those systems work, to make sure that our IEC standards fully address what is needed.\nThis is why the IEC set up the Systems Committee on Smart Cities in 2016.\nMost standards committees are focused on the supply side - how to make the technology work. However, the IEC System Committee on Smart Cities is focused more on the demand side – what the city, its people, and the city systems such as transport, water, waste, health etc, require of the electrical and electronics standards in order to enable those systems to work effectively. \nWe make some standards, for instance IEC 63152 City service continuity against disasters - The role of the electrical supply. However, our main role is to gain a deep understanding of cities and city systems and then to develop tools to make it easy for IEC technical committees to see how their focused standards work fits in with the wider requirements of smart cities.\nTo understand city systems, we review each system individually, map out how it works as a whole, then focus down at a more granular level to describe and analyse many specific real-world use cases within that system. The aim is to scope out the requirements of the families of standards needed to help solve city challenges. This is because to tackle a city need, a whole family of different types of standards is required – management, electronics, data, IoT, communications …  and these all need to be designed to work together\nTo develop guidance for standards committees and city stakeholders in general, we have set up a Joint Working Group with other international standards organisations to develop a common Smart City Reference Architecture to help identify commonalities between cities. We are also developing definitions of key terms and conceptual frameworks to enable a common understanding among standards committees, and city stakeholders.\nFinally, we are busy cataloguing and mapping smart city related standards to help city stakeholders and standards bodies easily find the standards they need.\nWe need your help to do an effective job.

        "content": "People with disabilities are never far from the minds of the many experts in the IEC who work all year round to produce international standards to help these vulnerable groups access technology, enabling them to overcome the barriers they encounter in their everyday lives. Another big part of IEC work is to make sure that all the electronic equipment can be used safely and securely by people with disabilities.\nThe IEC formed a systems committee, IEC SyC AAL, whose remit is, among other things, to foster standardization to enable usability and accessibility of active assisted living (AAL) systems and services. AAL services can be defined as systems which help people with disabilities to live independently. These include alarms, wearable monitoring devices, teleconferencing tools, assistive robots, automated air conditioning and lighting systems, to name but a few.\nSyC AAL has published three publications targeted at health funders, whether private or public, and manufacturers of AAL equipment. The first one is a technical specification, IEC TS 63134, which lists use cases of AAL services. “The document inventories near to fifty use cases and describes around 11 in detail. We were extremely careful to propose examples that are representative. The TS also establishes the terminology used throughout our publications,” explains Paul Boissoneault, one of the SyC AAL experts much involved in the development of the documents.\nThe two other publications are standards: the first one, IEC 63234-1, establishes a framework for the economic evaluation of AAL services, while the second, IEC 63234-2, looks specifically at the monitoring of patients with chronic diseases.\n“AAL products and services have never been more relevant than now, as we adapt to new ways of living and working in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, lockdown safety measures limited personal movement and access to services which would normally be delivered outside the home. As a result, companies are developing more and more products and services that can be used inside the homes,” explains the Chair of SyC AAL, Ulrike Haltrich.\nShe also chairs an important Technical Committee, IEC TC 100, which prepares standards for audio, video and multimedia systems. The TC established a technical area working group specifically dedicated to developing standards for AAL, notably for wearable electronic devices and specific user interfaces. \nSafety in the home\nIEC TC 59 prepares performance standards for household appliances. It has been working on accessibility standards for several years largely at the behest of consumer representatives inside the IEC, notably from the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) Consumer Council.\nIEC 63008 contains test procedures and requirements to improve the accessibility of household appliances for people with disabilities. These test requirements are described independently from the device. This means that they can apply to a wide range of household appliances, including washing machines as well as smaller items, such as egg-cookers or electric kettles. They concern control elements, for instance door handles and drawers on washing machines, push buttons on microwave ovens or vacuum cleaners and so on.\nThese are only a few examples of the ways IEC Standards can help people with disabilities. In doing so they contribute significantly to UN Sustainable Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."

        "abstract": "IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems are helping the aviation industry to go green.",
        "content": "The aviation industry is still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw travel plummet especially over long-distance destinations. As for most of us, though, it was also a time for the industry to reflect. The requirement for more sustainable forms of aircraft emitting less CO2 gained increasing momentum. As fewer planes took to the sky and other forms of transport slowed down as well, with various industries grounding to a halt, carbon emissions decreased dramatically – pointing the way to a cleaner future.\nAccording to some estimates, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the aviation sector was responsible for about 2% of the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions. On its current fast-paced growth trajectory, some predict that the amount of CO2 from airplanes could triple by 2050, if nothing changes.\nThe aviation industry did not wait for COVID to embark on solutions for greener transport. The last couple of years have shone a new light on these efforts and perhaps made them increasingly obvious to those who were initially more reluctant to fully endorse changing technologies and processes.\nAt the recent United Nations Climate Summit in Glasgow, some of the biggest airlines signed a pact to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. In the medium-to long term, these carriers are vowing to move to net zero carbon emissions.\nAircraft powered by hydrogen\nOne of the options to reach zero emissions is hydrogen. As one of the major European aircraft and airspace manufacturers puts it, “We believe hydrogen is one of the most promising zero-emission technologies to reduce aviation’s climate impact. This is why we consider hydrogen to be an important technology pathway to achieve our ambition of bringing a zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035.”\nThe aircraft giant bets on a hybrid-hydrogen concept using both hydrogen as a fuel and electricity produced by fuel cells. The idea is to use a modified gas turbine engine which will be powered by hydrogen combustion – not unlike spacecrafts. Liquid hydrogen is combined with oxygen to generate fuel. In addition, hydrogen fuel cells will create electrical power that complements the energy produced by the gas turbine, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system. According to the company “all of these technologies are complementary, and the benefits are additive”.\nIEC Technical Committee 105 has recently published several ground-breaking standards relating to fuel cell technology. Among these, IEC 62282-8-201 concerns energy storage systems using fuel cell modules in reverse modes. It establishes performance indicators and test procedures of power-to-power energy storage systems using hydrogen.\n“Hydrogen and fuel cell technology can be expensive but by standardizing components and operating conditions in the field, we are paving the way for mass production”, one of the experts of IEC TC 105, Stephen McPhail indicates.\nTo read the full article: e-tech"

        "content": "The IEC and Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) have opened the AI with Trust conference in Geneva. The two-day event looks at how legislation, standardization and conformity assessment can interoperate more efficiently to build trust in artificial intelligence.\nIEC Secretary-General, Philippe Metzger, told the more than 500 people following the event, in-person and online, that greater cooperation and collaboration were needed between regulators, standardization experts, and conformity assessors to address the concerns of society. \n\"We realize, though, that especially where AI and other emerging technologies are concerned, there is a huge amount of work happening in parallel across many organizations, which to us means that there is tremendous potential for identifying and where possible, utilizing synergies,\" Mr. Metzger said.\nThe Deputy Director of the FDFA's Directorate of International Law, Roger Dubach, agreed. He cited a Swiss government report about emerging regulatory frameworks for AI at the international level.\n\"The same concerns and principles, especially the ethical ones, are discussed at all different levels and in many different fora, but with almost no interconnection and exchange amongst each other,\" he said.\n\nMr. Dubach underlined the importance of finding a common language between technicians and lawyers. \"We need to talk to each other and to identify together the right questions.\"\nMr. Dubach cited the word \"decision\" to illustrate his point. \"Technicians use this term to describe an output of an algorithm. Lawyers understand 'decision' as a human capacity, as a 'judgment' which might be subject in front of a court or authority, for which there is a legal remedy and a legal procedure to appeal.\"\nMr. Metzger said the IEC could offer stakeholders a platform to strengthen the dialogue and to ensure that all were fully cognizant of their potential impact. He said that the whole history of the IEC had been about facilitating collaboration between nations to develop consensus-based standards and a global system for conformity assessment.\nMr. Metzger said that this was visible in the work of the joint IEC and ISO committee on AI, where ethicists, lawyers, social scientists, and others are participating in standardization work to tackle topics such as trustworthiness and bias in algorithms. He said that this year, the experts had already produced guidelines on algorithms and the governance of AI in organizations with a ground-breaking ISO/IEC Technical Report on the ethics of AI expected shortly.\n\n\"This really drives home the point that international standards cannot be developed in a vacuum, but must also consider the potential societal repercussions that new technologies may engender,\" said Mr. Metzger. While we can and do provide advice on how to approach ethical issues, it is, of course, not our role to make ethical judgments about the use of specific technologies.\"\nMr. Metzger and Mr. Dubach said the IEC and the FDFA would continue to work together to identify gaps in the cooperation between the different international actors to develop concrete solutions. \nThe AI with Trust conference presents different stakeholder perspectives on the interplay between legislation, standards and conformity assessment. The second day of the conference will be more hands-on, with three use case sessions focusing on healthcare, sensor technology, and industrial robotics and automation."

        "abstract": "The European Commission has recently published a package of proposals to promote the circular economy, including an extension to the scope of the existing eco-design framework.",
        "content": "The European Commission has recently published a package of proposals with the aim of ‘making sustainable products the norm’. Specifically, the Commission seeks to increase the well-being of its citizens and ensure sustainable growth by making better use of resources as well as improving the products. This goal will be achieved through a number of initiatives, with the Regulation on Eco-design for Sustainable Products at its core. \nThis Regulation extends the scope of the existing eco-design framework to include a broader range of products. It calls for setting minimum criteria for energy efficiency as well as for product circularity and an overall reduction in the environmental footprint of products.  It will support circular business models, new rules to empower consumers for the green transition, sectoral rules for certain product categories as well as the construction and textile industries, and new eco-design rules for electronic products.\nAccording to the European Commission, electronics is the fastest growing waste stream. It recognizes consumer frustration with the obsolesce of products, the limited ability to repair products and a limited recovery of components and materials. The Commission is therefore developing new eco-design measures targeting consumer electronics and cover topics related to products circularity such as durability, reparability, and recyclability. \nIEC work promoting the circular economy\nAs products last longer, standards are needed to ensure product safety, performance and reliability are sufficiently taken into account. Issues such as data removal and security must also be considered as products are reused and change ownership. Moreover, a holistic approach is needed to ensure that the protection of the environment is not detrimental to areas such as product safety, EMC and performance.\nLegislation, such as the new proposal from the European Commission, will require standardized methods and tools to assess aspects such as the proportion of reused components or recycled content in a product, and how to assess the ease (or difficulty) with which a product can be repaired or remanufactured. Also, standards are needed to guarantee the properties of the used material, as well as to define the requirements for parts reliability. \nWithin the IEC, several standards support material efficiency for electrical and electronic products. Some examples include:\n\n\nIEC TR 62635 with information on product end of life, including the recyclability rate calculation.\nIEC TR 62824 with guidance about material efficiency considerations in the eco-design of products.\nIEC 62309 which examines the dependability of products containing used parts.\nIEC 63077 which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment.\n\nAdditional standards are currently under development. IEC TC 111 is preparing several standards addressing the principles of product circularity in environmental conscious design, the proportion of reused components in products as well as the sustainable management of e-waste. IEC TC 62 and IEC TC 2 are developing standards on the refurbishment of medical equipment and rotating machinery, respectively."

        "content": "IECRE expert Elaine Buck replies to our questions about her work and how it has evolved over the years. Read the whole interview in e-tech.\nHow did you become involved in IECRE work? \nFrom 2014 to 2021, I was Technical Manager at the European Marine Energy Centre or EMEC, based in Orkney, Scotland. In this position, I was responsible for providing accredited testing services at wave and tidal test sites worldwide. During my time there and involvement in testing, I became active at the IECRE. I was keen to further the testing capabilities of test centres in order to progress the commercialization of wave and tidal energy systems and was involved in a tidal power performance assessment of US developer Verdant Power. Through the test, we were able to submit the EMEC application to become the first designated IECRE test centre, with the scope to deliver tests in relation to the IEC 62600-200 Standard for tidal power performance. This work also helped to formalize the expectations for test centre performance and quality outputs for the whole IECRE. It is, for instance, supporting the development of the IECRE operating documents for the assessment of test centres.\nWhat are the main takeaways from IECRE? What are the aspects that you feel the IECRE programme brought you? \nThe IECRE programme has given me a broader understanding of the challenges faced in the marine energy sector and the impact on commercialization of marine energy technologies. I appreciate the access to learn from the other sectors at the IECRE, such as wind, which have been working at standards application and commercialization for much longer than the wave and tidal sector. The lessons learned from other sectors help to guide the nascent industry we are in. For example, the certification process with certification bodies and how the test centres should be contributing to the certification process through appropriate measurement test campaigns.\nHow do you see the evolution of your job?\nI have gone from commercial organizations to non-profit organizations, to most recently a government career. With it, my understanding of the technology development of commercial products and services has evolved, from seeking funding for a non-profit business to identifying funding gaps for the marine energy sector, including distributing awards for R&D. For me, this has been a great career lifecycle to be involved in. It has built up my endurance and created a lot of empathy for the inspiring developers in this sector. I came to the standards space thinking that standards stifle innovation. However, through amazing mentorship, I learned to understand their value and ability to create the foundation from which R&D wave technology derives and how it can deliver on common and international accepted methodologies."

        "content": "The sale of electric vehicles is booming. According to Statista, with nearly 7 million EVs sold in 2021, sales have doubled compared with the previous year. In Europe, electric vehicles outsold diesel cars in December for the first time. In 18 countries, more than 20% of new cars sold were electric. \nTo help ensure that electric vehicles operate and connect safely to the electricity grid, IEC Standards are needed. The standards developed in the IEC 62196 series, specify the requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets to interface between the EV and the EV charging system. Known as “accessories” for electric vehicles, they are used for conducive charging systems such as the Combined Charging System (CCS) and CHAdeMO.\nA new edition of the first part of IEC 62196 has now been published. IEC 62196-1, Plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle connectors and vehicle inlets - Conductive charging of electric vehicles - Part 1: General requirements describes the interface between the electric vehicle and the charging station and defines the requirements and test methods for the accessories used.\nAccording to Joseph Bablo, who helped lead the revisions to the standard, “With this new edition, we have made significant technical changes which include additional requirements for contact materials as well as additional tests for accessories to address thermal stresses and stability, mechanical wear and abuse, and exposure to contaminants.”\nIEC 62196-1 has been developed by IEC Subcommittee 23H, Plugs, socket­outlets and couplers for industrial and similar applications, and for electric vehicles. It replaces the previous edition which was published in 2014. A Commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 62196-1 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition.

        "content": "The IEC recently participated in the 9th International Electric Vehicle Expo (IEVE) which took place in Jeju, South Korea in early May. Representing the IEC, Gabriela Ehrlich provided a keynote address about the role of standards in the electrification of transport. Other speakers included Ban Ki-moon, the former UN Secretary General, Wi Sung-gan, member of the National Assembly, and Nathan Chang, Executive Vice President of Samsung. \nAccording to Ehrlich, the electrification of transport began in 1881 when Gustave Trouvé presented the first electric vehicle which consisted of a bicycle with 3 wheels. “In 1900, one-third of all road vehicles in New York City were electric. People clearly liked the electric automobile, because it was superior to its gas competitors which were smelly, noisy and vibrated a lot. And electric vehicles were also much easier to operate. Over the next few years, delivery vehicles, trucks and buses were also electrified,” Ehrlich notes. \nYet, the momentum for electric vehicles soon came to an end with the discovery of cheap crude oil. By 1935, electric vehicles were forgotten. \nCurrent situation\nTransport currently accounts for 25% of total carbon emissions in the world, making it the 2nd largest carbon emitter. Compared with 1990, the transport sector has increased its carbon emissions by nearly 80%. \nHowever, as Ehrlich remarks, “Electric vehicles, now more than ever, hold the key to decarbonizing the transport sector. They are several times more efficient at converting energy into propulsion than gasoline or diesel combustion engines, and they are clean at the point of use.”  \nAchieving the UN SDGs\nMaking transport more sustainable will be essential to achieving six of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations in its blueprint for building a better world by 2030. The electrification of transport will not only include cars, but also ships, trains, and other vehicles that use fossil fuels as an energy source. \nEhrlich gave the example of Norway where the deployment of electric cars and ships has reduced transport-related emissions by more than 29% since 2012.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTechnology enablers\nTechnology has a key role in helping to make transport more sustainable. In her presentation, Ehrlich provided an overview of four technology areas that can enable the goal of sustainable transport: \n\nthe electrification of transportation vehicles of all kinds \nintelligent transport systems and infrastructure which help improve efficiency, relieve traffic congestion and reduce traffic accidents\nautomated driving vehicles \nthe integration of transport with energy systems, which is essential for the low-carbon transition for both the transportation and power sectors. \n\nAccording to Ehrlich, “International standards from the IEC, ISO and ITU play a key role in promoting and deploying technology innovations in all four key areas of sustainable transport. Other standards organizations such as SAE, ETSI, or IEEE also contribute important standards in these areas.”  \nRole of IEC Standards\nGiven the role of the IEC in the standardization of electric, electronic and ICT technologies, the IEC will be key in developing standards for future sustainable transport systems. Standards are be needed in areas such as batteries, fuel cell technology as well as charging and discharging technologies. As Ehrlich notes, “The innovation and broad commercialization of electric vehicle technologies directly depends on the standardization and conformity assessment work within the IEC.”\nThe electrification of the transport sector is closely linked with the smart grid and, by implication, with the smart city as it will need to be integrated with the grid to become sustainable. Several IEC technical committees have developed the foundation for the integration of transportation within energy systems. “Such work is crucial for the acceleration of the global deployment of sustainable transportation systems,” concludes Ehrlich."

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an unrivalled technology in its potential for positive economic and social change. For this to happen, there needs to be Trust in AI — from both consumers and businesses — to adopt the technology, which is why conferences like the IEC’s AI with Trust, on 16 and 17 May 2022, are essential.\nThe AI field is growing rapidly and there are many new organizations working with AI or growing their involvement with AI. These organizations need to find the insight they need to embed trust into AI. \nThe UK government published its National AI strategy in September 2021. The Strategy notes that the integration of standards in the government’s model for AI governance and regulation is crucial for unlocking the benefits of AI, in particular referencing the importance of the forthcoming AI management system standard – ISO/IEC 42001.\nThe key initiative in the strategy to make the standardization element happen is the announcement of a pilot AI Standards Hub (launching in 2022). There are three partners working with the government on this – The Alan Turing Institute (UK’s national institute for data science and AI), NPL (UK's national metrology institute) and BSI (UK national standards body).\nThe Hub has four functions:\n\n\nTracking AI standards\n\n\nConvening, connecting and community building\n\n\nEducation, training and professional development\n\n\nThought leadership and international engagement \n\n\nThe Hub will provide a platform to advance discussions about AI standardization, educate, enable active participation AI-related standards development, and facilitate the use of relevant published standards.\nThe AI Standards Hub will cover the breadth of standards being developed in AI — including ISO/IEC SC 42 (the committee developing ISO/IEC 42001) and other key SDOs (standards development organizations) in AI. Although the majority of standards thus far have been cross cutting on topics such as governance of IT or bias,  there is also a need for vertical standards, as is apparent from the “AI with Trust” programme.\nIn stakeholder market research that was conducted to specify the hub, both horizontal and vertical standards were viewed as valuable — but with a mix of perspectives on which was most important. It is likely that certain pioneering AI areas, such as healthcare or self-driving cars, will lead on sector-specific standards to build trust for specific use cases.\nAlongside good standards and regulation, there is also recognition on the need to utilise conformity assessment to build trust in AI, building on the established global testing, certification and accreditation infrastructure. ISO/IEC 42001 is one such standard being written in such a way that it can be certified against, and many more such standards should come.\nThe draft EU AI Act, like the UK AI Strategy, points to such a conformity assessment approach to build trust in AI.\nUltimately, to build trust in AI there is a need for a discoverable and navigable framework of regulation, standards and conformity assessment that both cuts across sectors and deals with sector specific challenges.\n \n\nRelated content\nA governance framework for organizations deploying AI systems\n \nInternational AI events and meetings\nAI with Trust\nISO/IEC AI Workshop"

        "content": "Produce from vertical farms is beginning to appear on supermarket shelves around the world. The proponents of vertical farming believe it can feed millions of people while reducing some of the negative aspects associated with current agricultural practices: carbon-emitting transportation, deforestation and an over-reliance on chemical fertilizers.\nVertical farming is defined as the production of food in vertically stacked layers within a building, such as a skyscraper or warehouse, without using any natural light or soil. Produce is grown in a controlled environment where elements including light, humidity, and temperature are carefully monitored. \nThe result provides urban dwellers with year-round access to fresh vegetables since they can be grown regardless of weather conditions, without the need for pesticides and have only a short distance to cover, from farm to plate. According to the research company Statista, the industry is expected to grow to $9.7 billion worldwide by 2026.\nA network of sensors and cameras collects data with detailed information about the plants at specific points in their lifecycle as well as the environment in which they grow. This data is not only monitored but also analyzed to enable decisions to be taken that will improve plant health, growth and yield. \nThe use of artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important to ensure that production yields and produce quality remain high.\nRelying on IEC Standards\nIEC Standards are essential to the technology used in vertical farms.\nThe Joint Technical Committee of IEC and ISO on information technology (ISO/IEC JTC 1) prepare international standards that contribute towards artificial intelligence (AI). Given the rapid developments in AI across many industries SC 42, was set up in 2017 with the mandate of providing standardization in the area of AI as well as guidance to other committees developing AI applications.\nAI depends on the gathering, analysis and sharing of great volumes of data which are exchanged between applications as well as with external service providers. SC 41 develops International standards for the internet of things (IoT), making connectivity possible, while SC 38 addresses the standardization of cloud computing for the storage and retrieval of data.\nInternational standards for lamps, electric light and lighting solutions are developed by IEC Technical Committee 34 and its subcommittees. Standards for the design and use of semiconductors, including sensors, are developed by IEC TC 47.\nIn addition, several TCs prepare Standards in the area of industrial automation. These include IEC TC 65, which addresses process measurement, control and automation, IEC TC 17, which develops Standards for switchgear and controlgear and IEC TC 22, which standardizes power electronic systems and equipment. IEC TC 44 provides \nStandards for the safety of machinery. Conformity with the Standards developed by these TCs is provided by the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, IECEE.\nThe water used by vertical farms relies on pumps with motors that are standardized by IEC TC 2. As vertical farms switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, they will use Standards developed by IEC TC 82 for solar photovoltaic energy systems and IEC TC 88 for wind energy generation systems, for example."

In addition to SC 41, other subcommittees standardize cloud computing, cyber security or the well-known MPEG standards for video, to name but a few.\nCoallier reminded the audience that the IoT was not a technology but a system concept that uses many technologies and was an enabler of “the smart everything”. Among the technologies were cloud computing, distributed and edge storage of data, sensor networks and embedded systems, adding to the complexity of the standardization process. The strategic approach was to focus on foundational standards – vocabulary, reference architecture, interoperability and trustworthiness. A second prong of the strategy is to systematically collect use cases across all application domains as well as elicit and document standardization requirements. Another aspect is the incubator role: kick-start standardization in new domains and try to cover dead angles.\nHe reminded the audience how important it was for SC 41 to partner with other organizations and technical committees: “coordination is key to us”, he insisted. New joint working groups have recently been created with the energy sector. One has been set up with IEC TC 57 which publishes most of the core standards for the smart grid and another with the systems committee dealing with smart energy, SyC Smart Energy.\nErin Bournival is the convenor of the group inside SC 41 devoted to producing foundational standards for the IoT. She talked about the work on ISO/IEC 30141, which aims to establish an all-encompassing reference architecture for the IoT: one of the challenges she acknowledged was the that “the world is changing constantly and challenging our knowledge, prompting experts to move forward and build innovative systems”.  She gave the following definition of a reference architecture as an “authoritative source of information about specific subject areas that guide and constrains the instantiation of multiple architectures.” A second edition of the standard is in the works, and the group is reviewing stakeholder needs, including the updating of vocabulary where required and looking at unaddressed comments from the first edition of the standard. A final draft (FDIS) should be ready in 2023.\nTwo other experts from the group, Östen Karl Frånberg and Eric Simmon, also gave presentations on the work related to this foundational standard. Mr Simmon notably refered to a pattern-based approach guiding future work on ISO/IEC 30141.\nSeveral experts explained their work on other standards, including Quan Wang, the convenor of Working Group 4, which has already published four standards on the interoperability for IoT systems, all part of the ISO/IEC 21823 series.\nA final session was devoted to the notion of trustworthiness, a key area for SC 41. A panel of experts discussed why trustworthiness was important. The most usually used definition of trustworthiness, as mentioned by the participants, is “the ability to meet stakeholders expectations in a verifiable way.” Erin Bournival, one of the panellists, described the key characteristics of trustworthiness for IoT systems: “security, privacy, safety, reliability and resilience.” Asahiko Yamada, an expert from the advisory group on trustworthiness inside SC 41 mentioned how difficult it is to attain trustworthiness in IoT systems and that at some point certification will be needed even if it will take a long time to get there. Antonio Kung, an SC 41 expert, indicated that trustworthiness was a transversal concern and that a standard – ISO/IEC 30149 – was being developed on a trustworthiness framework, due in December 2023. “One should not confuse trust and trustworthiness, they are two different concepts,” he added.\nDigital Twin\nThe event on 28 April was devoted to Digital Twin. Dr Sha Wei, the convenor of WG 6, which is focusing on digital twin, summed up the results of the workshops which took place in September 2021 and which examined use cases, concepts, architecture and integration. Several challenges were identified including regulation, cyber security and multi twin interoperability. Gains from the use of digital twins we also pinpointed, including better prediction and planning, improved operation efficiency and maintenance, disaster prevention, remote expertise, energy savings and carbon footprint decreases.\nChunlan Guo, a key expert from the Systems Committee dealing with smart cities, SyC Smart Cities, explained the work related to digital urban twins and city information modelling with a standard in the works, IEC 63273. She also presented two use case of urban digital twins, the city of Nanjing in China and New South Wales in Australia.\nThe convenor of WG 7, Soo Hyun Park, explained the work of his group on maritime IoT and Digital Twin. He alluded to many applications for digital twin, including equipment monitoring, remote maintenance, hull load control systems, cargo handling equipment, monitoring and automation, to name but a few. Sensors are required to measure temperature, salt content, oxygen, colour, clearness, pollution, etc…The main aim is, for instance, to help with the environmental monitoring of lakes and other water areas. The group is working on maritime terms and definitions, uses cases and a reference architecture.\nLaurent Guise, one of the experts of the systems committee on smart energy, SyC Smart Energy, which has formed a joint working group with SC 41, explained how digital twins were used in the energy sector. He pointed out that they have already been employed in the industry for a long time, over the whole life cycle of utilities from planning to maintenance. Digital twins may be used prior to the construction of the asset or product, with multiple renditions and digital modes of the product characteristics. DTs can be employed for comparing the activity between two plants, for instance, or for operation maintenance. “Semantic interoperability is a must”, he said referring to the initial areas of work of the joint working group.\nYong Jin Kim, the convenor WG 5, which looks at the applications for IOT, gave several examples of how the IoT could be applied, including during the COVID pandemic and in ecological environment monitoring. Several standards and documents have already been published including ISO/IEC 30166, a technical report on the industrial IoT and ISO/IEC 30144 on wireless sensor networks, ssupporting electrical power substations. Work is in progress on ecological environmental monitoring, with a standard in the pipeline, ISO/IEC 30179.\nDr Kate Grant, another expert from SC 41, mentioned the work on a IoT use case methodology and the need to build a template, to be used by other IEC TCs. One of the examples cited was the use cases developed by the systems committee on active living SyC AAL, in IEC TS 63134 .\nAnother expert Howard Choe talked about smart fish farming as a prospective area for new standards. A rapidly expanding market, the area needs standards for automated fish farming management. “The market is lacking regulations and these should be based on standards,” he concluded.\nYou can follow the webinar here:\nhttps://www.iec.ch/academy/webinars"

        "abstract": "A new international standard, ISO/IEC 38507, provides guidance for the governing bodies of organizations that are either using or considering the use of AI.",
        "content": "Establishing a governance framework for artificial intelligence is essential for any organization that uses AI in its daily business. It is a boardroom-level responsibility, limited not only to ensuring the effective use of AI, but also encompassing risk management, regulatory compliance and ethical usage.  \nA new international standard, ISO/IEC 38507, provides guidance for the governing bodies of organizations that are either using or considering the use of AI. In addition to CEOs and senior executives, a broad range of other stakeholders will find it important reading, ranging from legal experts and accountants to regulators. \nISO/IEC 38507 will help organizations to adapt their existing governance and organizational policies for the use of AI. It offers guidance on defining responsibilities and assigning accountability.\n“Understanding the governance implications of AI is essential to ensuring responsible adoption,” said Wael William Diab, who chairs the committee that develops AI standards for the IEC and ISO. “Across virtually every industry, sector and application, AI is being considered as part of a digitalization strategy because of the transformational insights it can provide. \n\"Thus, this standard will be relevant to any organization looking to deploy AI regardless of industry.”\n“Beyond assisting decision-makers to understand the governance implications of AI, ISO/IEC 38507 is a highly applicable and practical international standard,” added Professor Yonosuke Harada, the project convenor. “AI is increasingly present in a variety of applications throughout an organization, regardless of the industry domain.\n\"The organization’s governing body acts as a conductor of all these activities and thus ISO/IEC 38507 provides practical measures throughout.”\nThe new standard will raise awareness and provide a toolkit for addressing a range of strategic issues, including but not limited to AI-related benefits and the mitigation of AI-related challenges. It takes a holistic approach, covering both processes and people.\n“People from across industry and society, ranging from business leaders to regulators, have expressed concern not so much about AI technologies themselves but rather about who uses them and how. This standard will help organizations address the questions and concerns that will inevitably arise from the use — or intended use — of AI,” said the project editor, Peter Brown.\nISO/IEC 38507 will also benefit business. The new publication shows how an effective AI governance framework can provide better insights and increased return on investment.  \n\n\nThe new standard builds on foundational projects. For instance, it references two other standards: the soon-to-be-published ISO/IEC 22989, on artificial intelligence concepts and terminology, and ISO/IEC 38500, Governance of IT for the organization.\nThe new standard also provides structured advice on the governance implications of AI data and how it is managed within the AI system over its entire lifecycle. ISO/IEC 38507 stresses the importance of data governance to ensure that the correct data is used not only for the correct purpose but also for future strategy.\n\nData must be used in the right way, and it will become unusable very quickly unless the right precautions are taken. The new publication helps users to manage data in a way that addresses business challenges both effectively and efficiently.  \nISO/IEC 38507 is the first port of call for any organization planning to deploy AI to further realize the benefits of digital transformation. “It is a must-read for digitally savvy directors,” said Jan Begg, who chairs the committee that produces IT governance standards for IEC and ISO. “It is a great conversation starter for CIOs and CTOs briefing their boards on AI usage, risks and opportunities”\nIt was developed in a joint working group comprising two key committees, for IT governance and artificial intelligence respectively, in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO.\nThe former focuses on the governance, service management and business process of outsourcing activities, while the latter provides guidance to IEC and ISO, as well as experts in the joint ISO/IEC technical committee looking at AI applications.\n \nFind out more about the centres of expertise in the joint ISO/IEC technical committee"

        "content": "The annual World Day for Safety and Health at Work promotes the prevention of occupational accidents. This year, the day focuses on enhancing social dialogue towards a culture of safety and health.\nThrough its work, the IEC ensures that safety is an integral aspect of devices and systems, thereby protecting people, critical infrastructure, economies and the environment. IEC Standards address aspects of safety that apply to many products as well as those for a single product type or industry.\nThe concept of functional safety\nWithin the overall safety of a system, functional safety refers to the aspect that provides automatic protection in response to errors. It provides the activation of built-in safety mechanisms to reduce potentially harmful risks. Examples include sensors that trigger the activation of a water sprinkler system when smoke is detected or the activation of an overflow valve when a certain level of liquid or pressure has been reached.\nIEC 61508 is a horizontal series of standards that provides functional safety requirements applicable to a wide range of industry sectors. It requires the analysis of the potential risks or hazards of a given system or device and provides categories to determine the level of likelihood of a potential hazard and the consequences should it occur. Safety integrity levels (SIL) are defined to indicate the degree to which a system will meet its specified safety functions.\nTo ensure the safety of machines and those who operate them, IEC 62061 offers a specific safety standard that is fully aligned with IEC 61508 including its SIL scheme, principles and vocabulary. It specifies principles that are unique to machinery control systems that provide safety functions will not only detect the risk but, additionally, take preventive action to decrease the risk.\nLooking towards the future\nThe introduction of intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, big data, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, are transforming the connection between technology and people. As more machines are integrated into factory and logistic automation, mobility and healthcare processes, the need to ensure safe procedures for people working with machines is increasing.\nA recent IEC White Paper, Safety in the future, examines the topic of safety in the new digital environment. It references current social trends and initiatives, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as various real-life examples that are pioneering innovative safety solutions for the future.\nThese solutions share the common understanding that the concept of safety will be delivered in an integrated system in which workers, machines and the environment collaborate. Based on this common understanding, the IEC White Paper introduces a collaborative framework called the tripartite system for safety to provide a systems approach to examining key elements of safety in the future. The collaboration will be made possible by information flows going back and forth between the different intelligent agents of the system: human workers, smart machines, and the IT-enabled environment in which they function.\nAchieving the goals of the tripartite system for safety will require significant participation from the standardization community which will need to mitigate the challenges related to decision-making between machines and humans."

        "abstract": "The second edition of a very popular standard for otoacoustic emission testing equipment has been published. It is one of the key standards developed by IEC Technical Committee 29.",
        "content": "There are several tests to measure hearing loss or absence of hearing, and some are more intrusive than others. The one which provokes the least disturbance is the otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. An ear specialist places a probe covered with soft foam in the organ. The patient remains passive throughout the procedure, which measures the vibration of sound in the ear.\nAs IEC TC 29 expert Erik Nielsen describes, “The most important reason for performing otoacoustic emission testing is that it allows the hearing of a new-born child to be tested, even though the child cannot actively participate in the test. This method enables children to be evaluated within the first day or two after being born. Undetected and untreated hearing problems can affect speech and social development. The otoacoustic emission test can also be used on adults that are physically or mentally prevented from participating actively in a standard hearing test.”\nThe new edition of IEC 60645-6 defines minimum mandatory functions and characteristics for otoacoustic emission instruments to ensure that measurements, made under comparable test conditions with different instruments specified in the publication, will be consistent. In other words, says Nielsen, “We must ensure we get the same result, no matter which equipment is used, as long as the equipment complies with the standard. To achieve this goal, it is important to clearly define the technical features of such equipment, as well as the required accuracy of these features.”\nRead the complete article in e-tech."

        "content": "Earth Day is marked on April 22 to focus attention on the climate crisis. Every year, hundreds of millions of people around the world participate in activities to highlight the need for immediate action to combat environmental degradation.\nThis year, organizers are rallying around the “need to act (boldly), innovate (broadly), and implement (equitably)” by all members of society – from businesses to governments to citizens. \nRecognizing the need to become more resilient, sustainable, inclusive and safe, as defined in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many governments are taking action. Through their commitment to the Paris Agreement, world leaders have pledged to reduce harmful emissions.\nEfforts are underway to revitalize transport infrastructure, water systems, broadband and manufacturing. Governments are investing in healthcare and fighting climate change, as well as building more resilient infrastructure to cope with the effects of extreme weather caused by global warming.\nIEC Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems can help with this effort.\nAs IEC Secretary-General & CEO, Philippe Metzger notes, “At a time when the world is shifting towards decarbonization and an all-electric society, advanced technologies grounded in knowledge-based systems can provide solutions more than ever. However, for their successful implementation, a global framework for collaboration is needed to translate political vision into effective solutions.”\nIEC standardization and conformity assessment activities work toward achieving a minimal impact on the environment and optimal use of resources. As an example, IEC energy efficiency standards play a significant role in the fight against climate change. \nIEC Standards and conformity assessment also underpin the increasing use of sustainable sources of electrical power, in areas such as hydropower, ocean power, solar energy, wind turbines and fuel cell technologies. Renewable energy helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while satisfying the ever-increasing demand for energy, both in developed and developing countries.\nWith IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications), the IEC facilitates the trade of equipment and services in the solar, wind, and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and performance.\nIEC activities also address the substances and processes used in the manufacture of electrotechnical equipment and systems. Commonly referred to as hazardous substances, these are elements or compounds which can have serious consequences on the environment and human well-being.\nIEC expertise is being used by government regulatory authorities around the world to ensure that the optimal solutions are put in place to manage these substances.\nAs Mr Metzger concludes, “The journey towards a sustainable future will require effort. The best solutions will be developed in a spirit of collaboration based on global expertise. The IEC standardization and conformity assessment community is rising to this challenge and responding with effective solutions.”"

She tells the IEC blog about her views on how standards can help the environment and how encouraging diversity is a key concern at SA.\nHow important are environmental standards and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Standards Australia?\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a vital blueprint for a concerted action to address the many challenges humanity faces. The agenda is global in nature and universally applicable, taking into account different national realities, levels of development, and respecting national policies and priorities. International standards development can assist in the delivery of this shared agenda, which on the one hand requires a collective response, and on the other allows countries to develop their own pathways to reach national targets. Environmental standards in particular allow businesses to move ahead in the establishment of positive environmental practices when policy makers are not as fast to act.\nA majority of women are on the Board of Standards Australia. How does that influence your day-to-day work?\nAs an organization, SA has always strived to reflect, respect and celebrate diversity. This is the reality for our Board of Directors but also our workforce. At Board level, we don’t only focus on gender diversity but also on professional and social diversity, which certainly brings a much-needed variety of perspectives. This, in turn, advances the work that we do.\nIn 2021, our Board led a review of the governance of SA, looking deeply at the modernization of our company’s governance arrangements. One of the most significant changes was the makeup of our Standards Development and Accreditation Committee, which has a similar function to the IEC SMB. The SA Board wanted to ensure a broad diversity of perspectives and set specific positions to be held by representatives of industry, end consumers, regulators, young professional alumni, on a skills-based approach. The diversity within the group means that there is a greater variety of views and a much richer debate, challenging the status quo when it comes to our standards development operations. It is early days but very exciting, nonetheless.\nRead more in e-tech."

        "content": "The Blackberry 2022 Threat Report highlights the growing vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber-attacks. The power grid, manufacturing plants, transport, and the healthcare sector all use cyber-physical systems, where information technology and operational technology work together.\n“Every organization, in every vertical industry sector, runs the risk of breach, ransomware deployment, and extortion,” says the report. “However, few carry the same real-world risk from cyberattacks as those in the critical infrastructure sector.”\nUnfortunately, many critical infrastructure systems are not equipped to deal with cyber threats. A key issue, as explained in a special IEC Technology Report, is that cyber security is commonly understood only in terms of IT.\nThose responsible for security often overlook the inherent operational constraints in critical infrastructure.\nOperational technology (OT) called industrial control and automation systems (ICAS) run in a loop to check continually that everything is functioning correctly. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems utilize remote terminals to control the switches that regulate production.\nCyber-attacks on IT and OT systems often have different consequences. The effects of cyber-attacks on IT are generally economic, while cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure can impact the environment, damage equipment, or even threaten public health and lives.\nIT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called C-I-A triad. Confidentiality is of paramount importance and information security management systems, such as the one described in ISO/IEC 27001, are designed to protect sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or credit card numbers, for example.\nIn cyber-physical systems, the emphasis is on protecting safety, integrity, availability and confidentiality (S-I-A-C). Availability and integrity both take presence over confidentiality. \nAvailability is of utmost importance because they must stay up and running, avoiding interruptions or unexpected downtime. Cyber-physical systems are designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks and devices.\nIntegrity is about ensuring the consistency of systems, networks and data. It is crucial that the data that reaches the control room accurately reflects what is happening to ensure safety and maintain operations.\nWhen implementing a cybersecurity strategy, it is essential to take the different priorities of cyber-physical and IT systems into account. IEC provides relevant and specific guidance via two of the world’s best-known cyber security standards: IEC 62443 for cyber-physical systems and together with ISO, ISO/IEC 27001 for IT systems. \nConformity assessment provides further security by ensuring that the standards are implemented correctly: IECEE certification for IEC 62443 and IECQ for ISO/IEC 27001."

        "abstract": "A new microgrid in India brings together key technologies that rely upon IEC Standards.",
        "content": "IElectrix has launched its Shakti microgrid in New Delhi. This grid will improve the resilience and quality of the electricity supply in the city using solar energy. It brings together solar photovoltaic technology, battery storage, a smart transformer and an energy management system. Many of the technologies used in this grid rely upon IEC Standards.\nThe pilot aims to show how innovative solutions allow for the implementation of local energy communities using solar PV modules. IElectrix, a consortium of energy specialists from Europe and India, has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.\nUnderstanding smart grids\nConventional power grids deliver electricity in a one-way direction to different consumers. However, with the possibility for local power generation through such as, for example, solar panels, grids must now integrate and store excess power when variable energy sources are insufficient. To ensure that the grid can safely and efficiently absorb such bi-directional distributed energy resources (DERs), intelligence must be added. New smart grid technologies are helping operators to efficiently balance the grid between supply and demand.\nIEC 61850 standards are a foundational series of publications which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They address issues such as the integration of renewable energies and DERs within the electrical network but also increased automatization and self-healing processes. The IEC 61850 series has been developed by IEC TC 57.\nFocusing on renewable energy\nDERs often combine renewable energy installations, such as solar modules, with a battery or a generator to form a microgrid generally used by a small number of consumers. In the IElectrix project, solar energy will power the microgrid.\nSeveral IEC technical committees develop international standards for renewable energy systems including IEC TC 82 which focuses on solar photovoltaic energy systems. The IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) is one of the four CA Systems administered by the IEC. Its PV programme offers access to qualified testing laboratories for the certification of PV components and modules in accordance with the relevant IEC Standards.\nStandards for microgrids\nMicrogrids complement the conventional power grid when electricity demand is high and help to maintain supply during a grid-outage and restore electricity supply faster. They also help communities gain access to a more reliable supply of sustainable electricity.\nIEC TC 8 publishes several documents which specify the design and management of microgrids. In addition, IEC TC 21 prepares standards for secondary cells and batteries and, with IEC 61427-1, issued an essential standard for renewable energy storage systems. This standard specifies general requirements and methods of test for off-grid applications and electricity generated by PV modules.\nThe safe and efficient use of DERs relying on renewables on and off the grid is a powerful tool to increase grid resilience, but this can only be achieved if the parts and systems utilized have been designed, built and certified according to IEC Standards and CA Systems."

        "abstract": "The IPCC has recently published its Sixth Assessment Report which suggests that the implementation of certain policies can have a positive impact. Some of these policies will rely on IEC Standards.",
        "content": "According to the recently released assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average annual global greenhouse gas emissions were at their highest levels in human history between 2010-2019. Although the rate of growth has slowed, the situation remains critical. \nAs the report notes, “limiting global warming will require major transitions in the energy sector, involving a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency, and use of alternative fuels (such as hydrogen).”\nThe IEC provides the tools that will enable such a transition. IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems are essential for promoting energy efficiency, driving the adoption of renewable energy and transitioning towards an all-electric society. \nPromoting energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency requires measuring the energy consumption of a device, system or process. This is achieved through data collection and analysis as well as by testing and verification. A well-defined set of criteria and metrics is indispensable for achieving meaningful and comparable results. For electrotechnology products, these are often incorporated in IEC International Standards.\nA number of IEC technical committees develop energy efficiency standards for specific products and systems, such as IEC TC 59 for household appliances, TC 100 for audio, video and multimedia systems and TC 2 for motors. In addition, the IEC has set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) to help IEC technical committees adopt energy efficient solutions and support energy efficient technologies through their standards.\nConformity with standards is necessary to verify the energy efficiency claims made by manufacturers. IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, operates the Electrical Energy Efficiency (E3) programme to test and verify energy efficiency for electrical/electronic equipment, based on IEC International Standards.\nAdopting renewable energy\nAccording to the IPCC report, there have been sustained decreases of up to 85% in the costs of solar and wind energy, and batteries since 2010. The IEC develops a number of standards to ensure the safety, performance and efficiency of renewable energy systems for wind (IEC TC 88), solar (IEC TC 82), hydraulics (IEC TC 4), marine (IEC TC 114) and solar thermal (IEC TC 117). IEC Standards also facilitate the integration of renewable energy systems in the electrical grid. \nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications), is specifically designed for renewable energy systems. Established in 2014, IECRE provides third-party certification of equipment and services in the solar, wind, and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and performance.\nTransitioning towards an all-electric society\nThe IPCC report notes that significant reductions in emissions are possible in cities through such actions as creating compact, walkable cities, the electrification of transport in combination with low-emission energy sources and enhancing carbon storage using nature.\nIn February 2022, the IEC set-up a new systems committee that will address the issue of the future of sustainable transport. It will work together with a number of IEC technical committees such as those involved in railways (IEC TC 9), shipping (IEC TC 18), batteries (IEC TC 21), electrical accessories (IEC TC 23), road vehicles (IEC TC 69) and personal e-transporters (IEC TC 125).\nSupporting material efficiency\nThe IPCC report notes that reducing emissions will require using materials more efficiently, reusing and recycling products and minimising waste. Material efficiency, which is an essential part of the circular economy, calls for the conservation of materials by making products more durable, resource-efficient and facilitates the reuse or recycling of parts at the end of the life. \nCurrently the IEC is developing a number of standards related to the circular economy including general method for assessing the proportion of reused components in products, guidance on material circularity considerations in environmentally conscious design and sustainable management of waste. In addition, the Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) provides guidance on issues related to the environment, including the circular economy and material efficiency.\nThe IEC is fine-tuning the existing toolkit to facilitate the work of governments. A new advisory group has been set up to evaluate the potential for standardization activities addressing product carbon footprint evaluation and documentation in digital format. \nIn addition, collaboration has begun between IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, and IEC TC 111, which develops horizontal standards related to the environment, to develop climate change related conformity assessment services."

The 16-member panel is expected to make recommendations before the end of the year on the standards and definitions for setting net-zero targets.\n“By pooling our expertise and knowledge, together we can find an efficient and fair way to measure and verify the global efforts to reduce carbon emissions,” said IEC Secretary-General Philippe Metzger. \n“More than 100 years ago, IEC founder Lord Kelvin said that you can’t improve what you can’t measure. This remains true today. Together with ISO and ITU we are ready to leverage the expertise of our global network of standards and conformity assessment experts.”\nMr. Metzger said the IEC was committed to supporting efforts to build a more sustainable and inclusive world.\n“For us, that means realizing an ‘All-Electric Society’ with a zero-carbon economy, which will ensure global prosperity by providing universal access to affordable energy, generated from renewable and sustainable sources.” \nMr. Metzger said that IEC work could also pave the way to achieving a circular economy that takes better care of our resources. He explained that international standards and conformity assessment are powerful tools that can help governments and regulators to implement policies more efficiently and to reach development goals more quickly.\nThe IEC recently launched a Global Impact Fund to help solve specific environmental, social or governance challenges using IEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nEach year, through a formal call for proposals, grants will be given to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the delivery of projects where IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems can have a significant impact. While projects generally target one specific country, they are designed so that they can be replicated in other countries or scaled up for regional benefit.\nThe IEC Global Impact Fund focuses on SMEs given their well-recognized role as innovators in technology. IEC member countries and affiliates in the country where the project is implemented will serve as focal points to help the SME further engage with national stakeholders and leverage their project.\nInitial funding for the IEC Global Impact Fund will be provided by a contribution from the IEC as part of a three-year pilot. Further contributions are provided by external donors whose values and activities align with the core principles of the IEC.\nIEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems contribute directly and indirectly to all of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). IEC work provides the foundation that allows all countries to put in place sustainable, resilient infrastructure to stimulate economic development and innovation and apply global best-practice to manage quality and risk."

        "content": "A four-legged robot called Spot is patrolling the ancient Roman city of Pompeii to identify structural and safety issues. According to the park authorities, the robot dog “is capable of inspecting even the smallest of spaces”.\nSpot comes equipped with 3D laser scanning and 360-degree colour filming with image sensors that can operate equally as efficiently in full sunlight and low-light environments. The park has plans to send the compact and nimble robot into underground tunnels made by tomb raiders intent on stealing relics for art traffickers. \n“Often the safety conditions within the tunnels dug by grave robbers are extremely precarious, and so the use of a robot could signify a breakthrough that would allow us to proceed with greater speed and in total safety,” said the director-general of the archaeological park, Gabriel Zuchtriegel.\n\nSpot is being used for a variety of tasks around the world and beyond. For instance, it is being used to monitor power lines in Australia and Nasa is reportedly training the robot to explore caves on Mars.\nIEC produces international standards for many of the technologies that robots use, including sensors, batteries, and semiconductors. There are also IEC Standards for hardware components, such as touchscreens, and audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment. \nIECEx certified robots are widely used in hazardous environments across a wide variety of industries.  IEC TC 31 prepares and maintains international standards relating to equipment for use where there is a hazard due to the possible presence of explosive atmospheres of gases, vapours, mists or combustible dusts.\nThe Joint Technical Committee of IEC and ISO on information technology carries our standardization that focus on the entire AI ecosystem, addressing issues concerning trustworthiness, robustness and computational methods. \nAI depends on the gathering, analysis and sharing of great volumes of data which are exchanged between applications as well as with external service providers. This makes it equally possible for an assistant-enabled device to turn on the oven or for a manufacturer to improve the safety features on its cars.\nThe joint technical committee also develops international standards for the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing for the storage and retrieval of data, among others.\nOf course, not all the challenges that the IEC faces are purely technical. The IEC is committed to help find answers to the many social challenges and ethical dilemmas raised by technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence. \nIEC experts are looking at a number of issues, including, among others, privacy, security and trust for the widest possible benefit. The IEC has set up groups to investigate ways to ensure that ethical considerations shape the development process. \nThey have been tasked with developing broadly applicable guidelines for IEC committees on ethical aspects related to autonomous and/or AI applications. They are also engaging with other relevant actors, such as academia, to explore issues from a variety of perspectives. \nThe aim of the IEC is to maximize public good while limiting the risk of inadvertent harm or unintended consequences. International standards developed by multiple stakeholders ensure the right balance is struck between the desire to deploy artificial intelligence and other new technologies rapidly and the need to study their safety and ethical implications.\nPompeii, which lies around 20km to the southeast of Naples, at the southeastern base of Mount Vesuvius.

        "content": "Zombies pose a real and present danger, but not the flesh-eating variety of the movies. In the world of cyber security, zombie armies — also known as botnets — are malware-infected computers or other connected devices inked together and controlled remotely by a malicious hacker.\nThe hacker uses her botnet to launch DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, which aim to overwhelm targeted IT networks with more traffic or data than they can manage. When successful, DDoS attacks can take their victims offline, with potentially devastating consequences for business operations and possible supply chain disruption.\nDDoS attacks have been increasing in number in recent years and there is evidence that hackers are adapting their strategies to neutralize commonly used countermeasures and mitigation techniques. In other words, cyber-criminals are becoming more creative as IT administrators grow used to dealing with one of the most common types of cyber-attack.\nMalicious hackers are constantly refining their methods. Recently, bad actors have been exploiting vulnerabilities in VoIP (internet telephony) systems in a number of countries. \nCutting-edge techniques such as high-impact reflection attacks — also known as amplifications — are being used to augment the volume of malicious traffic generated while hiding the sources of the attacks. They are often accompanied by ransom demands targeting victims in sectors as diverse as financial services, manufacturing, and government facilities. \nOne such attack lasted 14 hours, with the attackers generating a record-breaking 53 million packets of data per second (Mpps).  \nConsensus-based international standards, based on industry best practices, provide a tried and tested methodology to prevent and mitigate DDoS and other cyber-attacks.  \nISO/IEC 27001, for example, can help in several ways but first and foremost by showing organizations of all sizes how to implement an information security management system. An ISMS is a framework that provides a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology.  \nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 and the recently updated ISO/IEC 27002 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and repercussions. It also advises on designing countermeasures (controls) to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, as well as for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nIt is availability that is in the crosshairs during a DDoS attack. \nImplementing the ISMS described in ISO/IEC 27001 means embedding information security continuity in the business continuity management systems. Organizations are shown how to plan and monitor the use of resources in order to identify attacks earlier and take steps more quickly to mitigate the initial impact.\nIn addition, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met."

        "abstract": "Concepts and vocabulary for the marine sector are now part of the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary and IEC Technical Committee 14 has devised a new strategic business plan.",
        "content": "Marine energy is coming of age. Whether in Scotland or in New York, it is now powering many homes and facilities. Oceans offer one of the largest untapped sources of energy on earth. Tide, river and ocean current and wave power as well as differences in temperature and salinity can be – and in some cases are already being - used to produce energy.\nIEC Technical Committee 114 develops international standards for marine energy, including wave, tidal and other water current converters. Since its creation in 2007, the TC has been blazing a trail by issuing ground-breaking publications, which have paved the way for the various marine technologies being tested and used around the world today.\nAs marine energy has moved into the mainstream, and deployments of marine energy plants have multiplied, the priorities of the TC have evolved and entered new areas. The TC has worked with IEC TC 1: Terminology, over the years, to define key concepts without which the industry cannot move forward, and which are now part of the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV). These include basic concepts such as marine, ocean, river and tidal current and much more specific notions linked to marine and current energy converters, such as “principal axis of energy capture” or “energy extraction plane.” More on the terminology for marine energy standards can be found in https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/index?openform&part=417. \n“Having our vocabulary publicly available and a part of the IEV ensures broad usage and adoption globally while confirming the global relevance of our industry. The open-source access of the IEV is really critical as we try to encourage adoption of an harmonized language,” says Chair of IEC TC 114 Jonathan Colby.\nNew strategic business plan\nJust as importantly, the TC modified its strategic business plan (SBP) to reflect the changes in the sector. This new document has just been published and was previously amended in 2018.\nThe business environment has changed quite a bit since 2018 and this evolution is reflected in the plan. “Many nations are seeking alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear power and climate change concerns have stimulated closer investigation of marine energy. However, while there may be exceptions to the rule, the overall cost of energy, often referred to as the Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”), is a key driver of investment decisions and therefore reductions in capital costs and life-cycle operational costs will continue to be the primary focus of industry research and development efforts. An increase in the number of deployments has helped build operational experience and further inform design requirements,” it states.\nSeveral United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are listed as enabled or facilitated by IEC TC 114 standards, including SDG 7, SDG 11, or SDG 13, to name but a few. The SBP also lists all the standards published to date by IEC TC 114.\n“For the first time, the SBP connects the work of TC 114, both directly and indirectly, to 10 of the 17  SDGs. In addition, the SBP directly connects the work of TC 114 to relevant international standards developed across the IEC, ISO, and other international standards development organizations ensuring that the industry utilizes existing best practices while avoiding duplication in the suite of TC 114 standards. All stakeholders in the marine energy industry are encouraged to review this SBP and share it broadly within their community to ensure that the technical priorities identified are aligned with national research, funding, and regulatory initiatives underway around the world, “ Colby says.\nThe SBP is freely available for download on the TC 114 dashboard."

        "abstract": "NIST has published a new framework for assessing smart cities. Much like the IEC and its systems approach, this framework relies on a holistic vision of cities.",
        "content": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States has recently released a measurement framework to help assess smart cities.\nAccording to NIST, key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to evaluate smart cities but often fail to measure benefits linked to community impact and return on investment. For this reason, NIST has developed Holistic Key Performance Indicators (H-KPI) Framework that builds on conventional KPI methods while also assessing data across three interacting levels of analysis: technologies, infrastructure services, and community benefits.\nAdopting a systems approach\nAs demonstrated by the NIST framework, understanding the complexity of cities requires a holistic approach. For this reason, the IEC has adopted a systems approach to smart city standardization in recognition that cities are made up of individual albeit interconnected systems - such as water, energy, transport, etc- that must be addressed holistically. \nSmart cities make use of data and technology to offer improvements to city life, city services and resilience. By collecting data easily and using algorithms to analyze the data in real time, it is possible to formulate an overall picture of what is going on in a given area – and how it can be improved or strengthened.\nUsing standards to evaluate smart cities\nThe IEC has published several standards that can be used to help evaluate and understand the concept of smart cities. \nThe concept of a smart city will depend based on the perspective of a user. The requirements of an engineer, for example, will be very different than those of a policy maker, a tourist or an environmentalist. As a result, the IEC has published IEC SRD 63235 which offers a holistic system of systems approach in order to help users define the views, methodology framework, principles, processes, rules, and evaluation criteria for smart city system concepts building. This methodology can be used to enable collaboration between organizations built upon a common understanding of the concepts necessary for a smart city system.\nThe IEC works with ISO in its Joint Technical Committee 1 Working Group 11 (JTC 1/WG 11) to develop smart city standards related to ICT. In October 2019, JTC 1/WG 11 published ISO/IEC 30146 which provides assessment indicators and evaluation methods to measure the functionality of different ICT systems within a city. The indicators can be used to measure a smart city holistically or tailored to measure individual parts of the city.\nIn addition, three standards have been published that each address a different viewpoint within a city to be used by city information officers when planning and implementing a smart city. The frameworks include business process (ISO/IEC 30145-1), knowledge management (ISO/IEC 30145-2) and engineering (ISO/IEC 30145-3)."

        "content": "There are three types of conformity assessment (CA). The IEC supports all three, as well as running the IEC CA Systems, whose members provide third-party certification. \nIn first-party conformity assessment, a manufacturer or supplier declares that a product conforms to a given standard or specification. This process is known as an SDoC (supplier's declaration of conformity) and offers the lowest level of trustworthiness. \nSecond-party conformity assessment is more trustworthy as it is performed by a person or organization who has a direct interest in verifying the performance of a product. Typically, a large or demanding customer, such as a government, major buyer, or manufacturer, will put in place their own conformity assessment for products or services that they purchase. \nThis may include test facilities and special assessment procedures that are conducted to verify the quality of the supplied goods. The aim is usually to obtain assurance that a supplier has carried out a first-party CA according to customer specifications.\nThe IEC CA Systems offer the only globally standardized form of conformity assessment covering electrotechnology. They are the biggest working multilateral agreement in the world. \nThird-party conformity assessment refers to a type of certification performed by a person or organization that is independent of the seller or the buyer. It provides the highest level of assurance. \nThe IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies, into which professional conformity assessment bodies (CABs), from all over the world work together through peer assessment to ensure consistent and comparable results. \n\nTesting and certification is performed by CABs, including, among others, professional certification bodies, assessment bodies, inspection bodies and testing laboratories. This approach provides consistent and comparable conformity assessment results from anywhere in the world.\nWhen a CAB is accredited within its own country, the conformity assessment results from another participating CAB in another country are recognized and accepted within their country. They recognize each other’s results because they know they would get the same results themselves. \n\nThe operational model of the IEC global CA Systems creates value and is considered to be a world’s best practice. This is achieved through two activities. \nFirstly, all the participating CABs come together to determine a common understanding and interpretation of the standards, as well as common rules and methodologies for testing and assessment. Secondly, they conduct peer assessment to ensure that the common interpretation is understood correctly and that the common rules and methodologies are being applied. \n\nThe IEC CA Systems – IECEE, IECEx, IECQ, and IECRE – each cover a dedicated segment of electrotechnology. Their ultimate objective is to facilitate global product acceptance by means of one test, one certification and, when appropriate, one mark valid in all markets.\n \nFind out more\nWhat is conformity assessment?\nShort video introduction to IEC Conformity Assessment Systems:"

        "abstract": "The Building Momentum with WomenatIEC conference took place on 8 February. We share some of its major insights.",
        "content": "“Do not be a queen bee!”. These words were stated by Ziva Patir, one of the women panellists who took part in the Building the momentum with WomenatIEC conference, which took place on 8 March to celebrate International Women’s Day. Patir took part in the #WomenatIEC video campaign and throughout her career has often been the only woman in governance structures inside the IEC and ISO.\nOne of the key messages to come out of the conference is indeed for women to mentor and help other women to move forward in STEM (Science, technology, engineering and maths) careers and in standards organizations like the IEC and ISO, once they have reached a position to do so. IEC Secretary-General Philippe Metzger underlined how seriously the IEC is taking the issue of gender diversity with new structures like the DAC (diversity advisory committee) and the joint work done with ISO on making standardization work include gender diversity aspects inside Technical Committees. \nMost of the women on the panel mentioned that it was difficult have confidence in themselves when dealing with nearly exclusively male colleagues and they had all had to fight to gain that sense of confidence and overcome feelings of intimidation. Some mentioned the role of men who help and support women to achieve their goals, like Snežana Lilić, who heads of the Division for Electric Power and Electronics at the the Institute for Standardization of Serbia. Her previous manager, a man, pushed her to take responsibilities and encouraged her to not be scared of aiming high. Alistair Mackinnon, the Chair of IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, said that in his view, it was not for women to make all the efforts, but for men in the right positions to push women forward. He mentioned that when he started his studies in the 1980’s at Glasgow College of Technology, there were only a couple of women following the courses. However, in his early career he worked on nuclear submarines and ships where he was welcomed on board by a female captain. “The significance of that is that in the army there are processes and procedures that ensure that the best candidate gets the senior position, independently of their gender.” The point being that other organizations should perhaps put similar procedures into place.\nOne of the issues broached was indeed the glass ceiling and how even when women go into engineering and technical jobs, they very rarely reach higher positions. “Men still occupy leadership positions in science and few women are considered for these roles. There is a stereotype that men do better research than women and they are supported by their peers, for instance in the teaching community,” said Olga Petrova who is an expert engineer working inside IEC TC 38: Instrument transformers.\nSolange Blaszkowski, expert of IEC TC 111: Environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems and the Chair of ACEA, the IEC advisory committee on environmental aspects, underlined that she was the only female Chair of an advisory committee inside the IEC. She mentioned her experience of growing up in Brazil, an emerging country, where women massively enter the workforce to feed their families and where the topic of gender was less obvious for that reason. It is only when she did her PhD in the Netherlands that she felt the imbalance. “I would go to a conference and meet perhaps three or four women against 200 men. But that became my new normal.”  She encouraged women to believe in their strengths and use these to their advantage. “Women are more perceptive and use their heart even if they are battle types like I am.”\nXun Gong is an expert from IEC TC 111, where, she said, “she had the opportunity to work with many brilliant female and male experts, such as Solange Blaszkowski,” whom she sees as a role model. She also described the experience of being a young professional leader in 2018. “It was a fabulous experience, we exchanged opinions and knowledge of standardization work with YPs from all around the world. It was a great honour to be selected as leader.” \nShe sees it as a tool to encourage more women to join the IEC, as the programme in China recruits many young female experts.\n For more information and to follow the webinar : https://www.iec.ch/academy/webinars"

Despite the introduction of wireless connectivity, cables continue to ensure that high volumes of data can be transmitted reliably and quickly. Coaxial and balanced cabling are among the most widely available in homes, offices and industrial environments. Alongside the growing need for non-stop Internet connectivity, the demand for cabling has continued to increase.\nTo ensure the performance and reliability of balanced and coaxial cords, the IEC has issued a new edition of IEC 61935-2, Specification for the testing of balanced and coaxial information technology cabling - Part 2: Cords as specified in ISO/IEC 11801-1 and related standards. This standard provides the methodology for testing balanced and coaxial cords in order to demonstrate their performance and reliability during their operational lifetime. It also ensures their compatibility for use in cabling systems on customer premises as per the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 11801-1.\nAccording to Dave Hess who participated in the development of IEC 61935-2, “The demand continues to grow for wired internet communications in new offices and industrial equipment. With IEC 61935-2, the IEC is providing a standard that is essential for ensuring that cables are fit for purpose.” \nIEC 61935-2 is part of the IEC 61935 series of standards which provides the specification for testing balanced and coaxial information technology cabling. It was developed by IEC Technical Committee 46: Cables, wires, waveguides, RF connectors, RF and microwave passive components and accessories. \nThis is the fourth edition of IEC 61935-2 which was first published in 2003. Compared with the previous edition, the new edition of IEC 61935-2 has expanded the inclusion of cords to include the Categories 8.1 and 8.2 as defined in ISO/IEC 11801-1.\nA commented version (CMV) of the official IEC 61935-2 standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition. It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

        "content": "The IEC is very sad to announce the passing of respected and esteemed expert Fabio Gargantini, whose crucial contribution to standardization work spanned more than 30 years, at the IEC, in the Italian National Committee, CEN/CENELEC and ISO.\nSince 2016, Mr Gargantini was the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 61: Safety of household and similar electrical appliances, managing the activity of this important TC with a high level of professionalism and experience. He generously responded to enquiries, often contributing his personal expertise to those who were newer to the TC 61 family of standards. In 2013, he was appointed Convenor of TC 61/MT 32, leading the maintenance of the IEC 60335-2 Standards, regarding electrical commercial catering equipment. He excelled in that role, finalizing all pending publications over a one year period.\nHe also led the work of TC 59: Performance of household and similar electrical appliances, as Chair from 2006 to 2015. Since 1987, he was acting as Secretary of SC 59L, organizing the activities of this subcommittee, dealing with the performance of small electrical appliances.\nFor many years, he was also Chair of CLC/TC 61 and of the mirror NC TC dealing with performance and safety of household and similar electrical appliances. As delegation leader for the Italian NC, he was an active participant in many plenary meetings.His ability to build consensus during complex discussions over the years will be sorely missed. \nHe always provided for a considerable and proactive contribution to the development of IEC Standards and in the management of the different IEC TCs. His colleagues highlight his deep knowledge of the standardization systems and procedures at IEC, CEN-CENELEC and at national level as well as his long experience in testing and certification of products according to IEC Standards. He was also experienced in system certification and was an IECEE-CB Lead Assessor and ISO 9000 Quality Systems Auditor.\nMr Gargantini was very active in, and passionate about, the IEC conformity assessment activities, in particular his work in and with the IECEE Community. He was an inspiring member and was greatly admired for the roles he held within the IECEE during his many years of participation. He was always very supportive, motivating and was always looked up to as a pillar and mentor of the IECEE. \nIn recognition of his outstanding contribution to IEC, Mr Gargantini was granted the Thomas A. Edison award during the IEC General Meeting in Shanghai in 2019.\n“This unexpected and dramatic event leaves us lost for words. Fabio had been working with us for many years and we’ll never forget his kindness, his humanity together with his reliable, ethical commitment and contribution to the standardization activity at national, European and international level. Thank you Fabio for having given, to many of us, the pleasure of meeting you, you’ll always be in our hearts and in our memories,” said Giuseppe Molina, the general director of the Italian National Committee.\n“The IEC TC 61 family has lost a remarkable technical mind and skilled negotiator. He was a warrior for humankind. And as Chair of TC 61 he was full of wisdom, practicality, and precision. I will dearly miss his leadership and friendship,” said Randi Myer, Secretary of IEC TC 61.\n“It was more than just working together with Fabio in the standardization committees. It was also always a pleasure to meet with him on the sidelines of meetings. The conversations with him will be terribly missed,” said Luise Christmann, Secretary of IEC TC 59.\n“Mentoring, guiding and sharing his vast experience was one of Fabio’s passions. He always had an open ear for anyone who wanted to learn more and to understand better. He was a role model on how to do things correctly and how to interact with his peers and friends from the IECEE community,” said Wolfram Zeitz, the Executive Secretary for IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, and IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications."

        "content": "As countries shift towards a circular economy, the definition and value of waste is being re-evaluated. While many countries have provided official waste statistics for more than 40 years, new types of information are needed that can be used to better harness the economic value of waste. Increasingly, data is now needed on recycling, repurposing and reprocessing as well as waste volumes and handling.\nThe UNECE has recently announced the endorsement of the UNECE Framework on Waste Statistics which recognizes the threat posed by waste to human health and the environment. And, as economies augment their consumption, managing waste through disposal or recycling becomes increasingly important.\nThe new framework recognized the lack of clarity in the terms and definitions used in reference to waste. It therefore proposes a set of definitions that can be used to promote a common understanding. It also provides recommendations for improving waste statistics as well as for further work.\nE-waste is one of the waste streams mentioned in the UNECE framework. Recognizing the high cost of e-waste to the environment if not properly disposed, the IEC has begun work on a new project (IEC TC 111 WG 18) with the aim of developing a horizontal standard to facilitate the systematic, sustainable management of e-waste.\nAmong its objectives, this project seeks to reduce the amount of e-waste sent for disposal through reuse and recovery, prevent the inappropriate disposal of e-waste and restrict operators who do not comply with the standard or comparable requirements from receiving e-waste shipments.\nAccording to Christian Dworak, Convenor of the new working group on e-waste, “This new project on e-waste is the first time that product end-of-life management of waste is addressed by the IEC. We have had discussions on product design and performance but never discussed requirements on how to operationally handle worldwide product extended producer responsibility, reuse and recycling.”"

        "content": "Mobile phone calls, messaging and online banking all rely on complex mathematical algorithms to scramble information to protect it from malicious hackers, spies and cybercriminals. It is no exaggeration to say that there would be no confidentiality or security online without encryption and that many of the operations we take for granted today would no longer be feasible. \nThe most prevalent system nowadays is called public key encryption. It works by giving users two keys: a public key, shared with everyone, as well as a private key. \nThe keys are large numbers that form part of an intricate mathematical algorithm that scrambles a user’s messages. The sender encrypts a message by using the receiver’s public key in order that only the intended recipient can unlock it with her or his private key. \nEven though the public key is freely available, the numbers involved are sufficiently large to make it very difficult to reverse the encryption process with only the public key.\nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a widely used and highly efficient public key encryption technique based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves. The joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO is updating the international standard ISO/IEC 15946-5 to meet the increasing interest in ECC. \nThe updated edition is expected shortly. It will describe elliptic curve generation methods to support key management, encryption and digital signatures based on an elliptic curve.\nThe power of quantum cryptography\nAs computers become more powerful, however, and in the face of rogue states with the technology resources to pose a more serious threat, cryptographers are looking beyond mathematics to the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve greater security. Theoretically, a future quantum computer might even be able to break ECC using Shor's algorithm, although a powerful enough device has yet to be built.\nAs noted in ISO/IEC 18033-1, which provides a general introduction to encryption algorithms, this has not impeded efforts to develop quantum resilient encryption systems: “Despite the fact that quantum computers currently do not exist and it is unclear whether full scale quantum computers will ever be built, much recent research has been devoted to assessing the security of cryptographic algorithms against quantum attacks (attacks which involve the use of quantum computers)”.\nWhether or not full-scale quantum computers are built in the next decade, quantum cryptography is already here. Like quantum computing, it is based on the behaviour of quantum particles. \nFor example, an encryption system called quantum key distribution (QKD) encodes messages using the properties of light particles. The only way for hackers to unlock the key is to measure the particles, but the very act of measuring changes the behaviour of the particles, causing errors that trigger security alerts."

        "content": "The celestial navigation is one of the earliest methods used by sailors to help guide their ships. In open waters, when no longer able to track their progress using landmarks, sailors could determine their ship’s location by tracking the position of the sun or the movement of the stars. \nNowadays, sailors benefit from advanced technologies that provide detailed information on the ship’s exact location and surroundings. A modern bridge will include a wide range of marine navigation equipment such as radars, GPS, electronic charts and identification systems to name but a few. The display presentation of the information used for the ship’s navigation requires a degree of harmonization to ensure that a trained sailor from any part of the world can easily access and understand the available information.\nIn 2022 the IEC published a new edition of its standard IEC 62288 which provides the general requirements, testing methods and required test results for the presentation of information on a ship’s navigation display. This standard supports the resolution MSC.191 (79) agreed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that harmonizes the requirements for the presentation of navigation-related information on the bridge of a ship.\nIEC 62288 also addresses the guidelines for the presentation of navigation-related symbols, terms and abbreviations as specified by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (SN/Circ.243) in 2019 as well as the presentation of AIS data reports and the AIS Application Specific Messages as defined by the IMO (SN.1/Circ.289). It has been developed by IEC Technical Committee 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems. \n“This latest edition is the result of considerable discussion in both IMO and IEC to produce the next generation of display presentation. It provides symbology for ship bridge systems which will link sensors in a digital Ethernet network integrating common responsibilities such as route planning, navigation status monitoring, log-keeping, alert awareness and day-to-day chart management, notes Kim Fisher, the Secretary to IEC TC 80.\nThis is the third edition of IEC 62288 which was first published in 2008. A commented version (CMV) of the official standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition. It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes."

        "content": "The newly updated ISO/IEC 27002 supports and builds on the countermeasures — known as information security controls — set out in ISO/IEC 27001 for implementing and maintaining an information security management system (ISMS). It is designed to enable organizations of all types and sizes to manage their IT risks effectively.\nISO/IEC 27002 describes dozens of information security controls with guidelines for implementing them. These include, for example, controls for identifying information assets, defining appropriate protection responsibilities and maintaining an inventory that is up-to-date, consistent and aligned with an organization’s other inventories. \nThe revised edition adds more than 10 controls, while merging others and removing only one, reflecting advances in technology and best practices. The 114 controls in the 2013 edition have been consolidated down to 93.\nIt is worth underlining that Annex B maps the differences between the 2022 and 2013 editions. This will facilitate the transition to the new edition for organizations that already use ISO/IEC 27002. \nISO/IEC 27002 takes a risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology. Central to this is the notion that since trying to protect everything in equal measure is neither efficient nor sustainable, it is important to identify and focus resources on securing the most valuable assets that ensure business continuity. \nThe IEC advocates a holistic approach to cyber security, combining best practices with testing and certification, is the best way to build cyber resilience. ISO/IEC 27001 is part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications.\nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nMany IEC International Standards and all the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16, which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies. The cyber security standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family contribute by protecting key data and systems, while others, such as IEC 62443 help make critical infrastructure more resilient."

        "content": "Biometric security has been gaining traction as falling costs have been matched by a corresponding increase in reliability. Fingerprints, voice, iris patterns and facial recognition are nowadays regarded as viable and trustworthy methods of authentication.\nThey can be used digitally to identify and allow people access to countries, buildings, systems and devices. Used in airports and border control systems, facial recognition scans identify nationals and allow them to leave one country and enter another. \nIn other situations, this technology can open doors and give approved users access to high-level security areas. In homes, voice recognition is used to control heating, lighting and entertainment systems, and many of us use it to do rapid information searches. \nFingerprints offer a quick way to open smartphones and tablet devices. Though biometrics characteristics are harder to replicate, there are some security concerns surrounding systems that use them.\nJust as passwords can be stolen, fingerprints and other biometric markers are also vulnerable to so-called presentation attacks. For example, a cybercriminal could use a fake fingerprint or wear a 3D printed mask made with a face scan to gain access to a system.\nUnlike passwords, however, biometric markers cannot be changed, giving cybercriminals permanent access to any computer or electronic device requiring biometric authentication. The threat is real.\nIn 2019, security researchers breached a British database containing the fingerprints of more than a million people, as well as facial recognition information. Among the high-profile users of the database were the UK police, defence contractors and banks.\nA newly updated international standard, IEC/ISO 24745, emphasizes that “appropriate countermeasures to safeguard the security of a biometric system and the privacy of biometric data subjects are essential.” It offers guidance on the protection of biometric information under various requirements for confidentiality, integrity and renewability/revocability during storage and transfer. \nThe standard also provides requirements and recommendations for the secure and privacy-compliant management and processing of biometric information. Topics covered include: \n\nanalysis of the threats to and countermeasures inherent to biometrics and biometric system application models\nsecurity requirements for securely binding between a biometric reference (BR) and an identity reference (IR)\nbiometric system application models with different scenarios for the storage and comparison of BRs\nguidance on the protection of an individual's privacy during the processing of biometric information.\n\nThis document does not include general management issues related to physical security, environmental security and key management for cryptographic techniques."

        "content": "One hundred years ago, on Valentine’s Day 1922, the world’s first, regular entertainment radio station took to the air live from the British town of Writtle. The Two Emma Tock station only had 200 watts and transmitted only on Tuesday evenings for 30 minutes, on 700m (428 kHz).\nThe IEC has been supporting the development of radio receiving and transmitting equipment through its International Standards for more than 90 years, thus playing a major role in the development of a technology that continues to inform and entertain the public.\nRadio depends entirely on electricity as a source of power for transmission and reception, and on electrical and electronic components for its broadcasting and receiving equipment. Hence, four years later, in 1926, the IEC created TC 12: Radiocommunications, the first of a number of IEC Technical Committees (TCs) and Subcommittees (SCs) that develop International Standards for the components and systems that make radio.\nNowadays, IEC standardization work for radio broadcasting and receiving equipment is carried out by, among others: TC 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment and equipment; TC 103: Transmitting equipment for radiocommunication; and TC 108: Safety of electronic equipment within the field of audio/video, information technology and communication technology.\nRadio reception can be subject to interference from a variety of sources, which include electrical equipment. IEC has been involved in reducing that interference to radio (and later TV) broadcasts, initially in the 150 kHz to 30 MHz frequency range – which includes long-, medium- and short-waves.\nIt does that through its International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR), which was created and first met in 1934. In the same year, the Italian inventor, Guglielmo Marconi, told the International Congress of Electro-Radio Biology, in Venice, \"In the new era, thought itself will be transmitted by radio.\""

        "content": "Flowers, chocolates and cards are among the most common gifts given on Valentine’s Day. As an alternative, electronic devices can also make for memorable gifts, while text messages are often sent instead of cards.\nGadgets\nWearable electronics, including smartwatches, are an increasingly popular way of expressing affection on Valentine's Day. IEC Standards are helping to keep down the cost of recharging them, while also reducing electronic waste.\nAfter the successful introduction of a common charging solution for smartphones (based on USB technologies), in 2011, the IEC published a common charging interoperability solution in 2016, which went beyond smartphones to also include other electronic devices such as tablets and certain laptops. \nMore recently, the IEC has issued an update to the common charging interoperability solution (IEC 63002, which is based on the latest UBS technologies) that will support increasing adoption in an even larger number of electronic devices. \nWith it, different product chargers implementing this solution can be used with any electronic device that also implements this solution. The technology is backwards and forwards compatible, safe, and supports future innovation ensuring e-waste reduction and long-term user convenience.\nEmojis\nThe tradition of giving Valentine’s cards is reported to have begun back in 1415, when the Duke of Orleans sent a poem to his wife imprisoned in the Tower of London on 14 February. Nowadays, a text message decorated with emojis often replaces a card.\nAccording to the emoji search engine, emojipedia, some of the most popular emojis sent on Valentine’s Day include two hearts, a red heart, a face blowing a kiss, and a rose. All are available to insert from the emoji keyboard available on major platforms. \nEarlier this month, the Unicode Consortium published its new emojis for 2022. They include the finger heart, based on a popular Asian gesture popularized by South Korean K-pop stars, and the hand heart.\nThe Unicode Consortium works closely with JTC 1, the joint technical committee set up by the IEC and ISO, which is responsible for maintaining ISO/IEC 10646, the International Standard for the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS).\n3D printing\nThe global supply chain crisis has forced up the cost of roses and other flowers. An alternative could be a 3D-printed bouquet.  \nFor her wedding, one ingenious bride used her 3D printer to make her 200 blue and glow-in-the-dark flowers that she used in her floral bouquets. \nIEC is actively involved in the development of 3D printing standards through JTC 1.\nHappy Valentine’s Day to everyone!"

        "content": "As we celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, it is time to look back at how gender diversity is improving at the IEC, since the #WomenatIEC campaign launched exactly a year ago. The campaign itself was a huge success, reaching 1,734,519 people and led to a huge number of comments and discussions within and outside of the IEC community.\nFollowing on from the success of the #WomenatIEC campaign, IEC is organizing a webinar on 8 March, entitled Building momentum with #WomenatIEC, with some of the women who took part in the campaign and whose videos were the most viewed. The webinar is organized to coincide with International Women’s Day and will broach topics such as how to promote gender diversity at the IEC, within National Committees and in standardization. More will be revealed in coming days and weeks.\nAt IEC level, diversity – including gender - has now become a priority at governance level and one of the company’s core values. A new structure has been created, the Diversity Advisory Committee, whose task is to propose guidance to the IEC Board for its selection process of members of the other bodies reporting to the IEC Board. Guidelines may include appropriate skills and competencies matrices, best practices for diversity performance indicators and recommended monitoring measures, as needed at any level of the Commission. Such guidelines and provisions of recommendations shall also be available to National Committees for consideration in their nominations, including for membership on the IEC Board. \nIn 2020, IEC and ISO partnered under the stewardship of the Joint Strategic Advisory Group (JSAG) to develop guidance to help technical committees ensure they are developing gender-responsive standards. As part of these efforts, JSAG conducted the first ever industry questionnaire on gender-responsive standards development among IEC and ISO technical committees and subcommittees, the results of which were communicated in June 2021.\nPerspectives were gathered from 356 respondents (50% IEC, 50% ISO). The committees covered a range of sectors, from the more traditional technical industries to the service-orientated ones. While the initial responses showed that there is still quite a lot of work to do to make gender fully acknowledged when preparing standards, this was a first step and IEC and ISO are committed to continue collecting data on gender in standardization work. This will help establish a baseline and better understand the scale of the challenges, with a view to improving gender responsiveness in future standards development."

        "content": "The metaverse is a term open to interpretation. Most people understand that it points to the evolution of the internet as a digital world that closely mirrors our own, an experience which is enhanced by being three dimensional and persistent across applications and devices.\n\"We're starting to talk about the metaverse now in the same way we talked about the internet in the early 1990’s,” said Steve Koenig, VP for Research at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the organization that runs CES, during a press briefing. “When we were all using 56k modems and dial-up internet, it was impossible to imagine the things we'd be doing online today. I think the same is true with the metaverse.\" Koenig pointed to the building blocks which will be used to assemble “a metaversian immersive digital experience”. These include cloud computing, haptics, volumetric video and 5G networks.\nIn most of these areas, IEC is laying the groundwork with the appropriate standards. IEC Technical Committee 100 has recently published a new document pertaining to haptic technology. (https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-01/how-haptic-technology-is-changing-the-multimedia-experience). The joint technical committee between IEC and ISO, ISO/IEC JTC 1, which prepares standards for IT applications, leads the way on standards for cloud technology and volumetric video.\nSmart glasses which are comfortable to wear\nThe perspective of accessing the metaverse has given the makers of virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) displays fresh impetus. A new range of smart glasses is about to hit the market, promising a more comfortable experience for wearers than earlier devices such as Oculus Rift, Google Glass and Magic Leap One - all discontinued but with new versions in the works.\nMost smart glasses work using optical waveguides. These are structures imprinted on a piece of glass (either on one or both lenses) that bends light to the eye from a source (usually a mini projector) embedded in the corner of the frame. The source overlays virtual objects on the wearer’s vision with data typically derived from a smartphone. Recent developments have tended towards enabling wireless connectivity with the smartphone and reducing the size and weight of the headgear.\nIEC is developing standards for AR and VR as well as smart glasses displays. ISO/IEC JTC 1 /Subcommittee 24 works on interfaces for information technology-based applications relating to computer graphics and virtual reality, image processing, environmental data representation, support for mixed and augmented reality, and interaction with, and visual presentation of, information.\nIEC TC 110 prepares standards for electronic displays, including OLED, 3D, holographic as well as flexible screens. It publishes IEC 62341-2-1 on OLED displays for instance, which specifies the essential ratings and characteristics of OLED display modules. It has also issued IEC 62629-41-1, a technical report on 3D and holographic display devices.\nRead more about accessing the metaverse in e-tech."

        "content": "Lynne Gibbens is the IEC Manager of International Standards Development at the Standards Council of Canada (SCC). She is also the National Secretary of the Canadian National Committee of IEC (CANC/IEC), and a member of the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB).  In this excerpt of an interview  which can be read in e-tech, she tells us how the Canadian National Committee is broaching issues of diversity, notably for gender, and sustainability. \nIn 2020, SCC published the report When One Size Does Not Protect All: Understanding Why Gender Matters for Standardization, using data from 106 countries, about the impact of gender on standardization. What prompted SCC to carry out such research?\nIn 2019, SCC signed the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) Declaration for Gender Responsive Standards. It was signed by many standards leaders around the world, including IEC. As part of this commitment, SCC created a five-year strategy to improve gender equality in standardization. To effect positive change, first we needed to understand exactly how standardization impacted women. There is a lack of literature on this topic and this gap is often highlighted as a challenge. So, conducting research became a key goal of SCC’s five-year strategy. I’m proud to say that our research has been vital in building the case for change and has put us in a great position to measure and track progress.\nHow do the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 5 on gender equality, fit in with the work of the SCC?\nAs highlighted by the World Standards Day campaign, standards are vital to achieving the UN SDGs. A lot of research in mapping the relationship of standards to SDGs already exists. IEC, ISO and the Canadian Standards Development Organizations have each conducted their own research.\nAt SCC, our preliminary mapping of National Standards of Canada to the UN’s 17 SDGs found that only 2% of our national standards contribute to SDG 5, gender equality. As a nation that considers itself a leader in gender equality and diversity, we need to do better. This has concerning implications. For example, research shows that the risk of being injured or killed in a car accident is 73% higher for women because crash test dummies are based on male arthrometry. Women are not small men, and the assumption that they are has led to many preventable accidents.\nWhat are the main challenges faced by Canadian experts in the SCC mirror Committees, specifically when it comes to IEC Standards?\nDeveloping and using standards help build a more competitive and innovative Canadian economy. Studies show a clear link between standardization, labour productivity and economic growth. To ensure we meet the needs of all Canadians and under-represented groups, we must recruit and retain diverse experts to represent Canada’s interests. One of the main challenges in this is advancing diversity in Canadian mirror committees. We’re committed to engaging and recruiting more women, young professionals and new members from new and emerging technologies in standardization work.\nAnother challenge ties in with the pandemic’s effect on the global economy and participation in standardization. Its negative impact on businesses, especially SMEs, may result in fewer Canadian experts participating in national and international standardization activities. Organizations may face challenges in their supply chain, have limited financial and/or human resources, and have difficulty maintaining or rebuilding their business. This has the potential to limit their capacity to participate in standardization activities to represent Canada’s interests at IEC.\nWe also need to ensure that our members account for sustainability and environmental considerations when developing, amending or revising standards – not only in Canada, but internationally as well.\nLastly, this era of digital transformation will impact the nature of standards development, which is traditionally grounded in text-based documents. The shift towards digital content and virtual work has the potential to change text-based documents beyond recognition. The role of open-source software in standards will expand and could alter the very definition of a standard. It may affect the nature and scope of IEC standardization. Some of our members will welcome and master this transition, and others will not."

        "content": "IEC Technical Committee 59, which prepares standards to determine the performance of electrical appliances for household and commercial use, is planning to develop a test standard for refrigerated appliances to be used with distributed renewable energy sources, whether working off grid or with a weak grid.\nA project group has been set up to work on a document specifying the essential characteristics of off grid and weak grid refrigerating appliances for domestic or light commercial use, cooled by internal natural or forced air convection. The standard will also establish test methods for checking performance requirements and energy consumption characteristics.\nSuch a standard is seen as essential to achieve energy access and foster economic activity in emerging and developing parts of the world. According to a WHO report, each year some 600 million people fall ill from eating food that has gone bad, of which about half a million die. These people are mostly in emerging countries, where food preservation is an issue linked to poverty. \nWeak and off-grid refrigerators are one the ways of better-preserving food in these countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 17% of households have a refrigerator, and appliance ownership among off-grid households is substantially lower. (Source: https://impact.efficiencyforaccess.org/)\nWithout a standard, procurement programmes for aid, rural electrification and wholesalers have no basis on which to differentiate poor from good quality appliances. This may lead to low consumer satisfaction and risks of reputational damage if low-quality products are procured by and distributed to end-users. In addition, government authorities have no legally robust means to define and differentiate appliances worthy of fiscal incentives, tax or tariff reductions that could otherwise accelerate access. Lastly, a properly functioning competitive market will not be established and scaled up until appliances can be fairly tested and compared, with technical guidance for suppliers to innovate and improve.\nThe standard would help to meet several UN Sustianble Development Goals (SDGs), including including SDG 2 which aims to end hunger, SDG 3 which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, SDG 7 which is to supply affordable and clean energy or SDG 13 which is to avoid climate change.\nThe project leader, Patrick Beks, says: “Standardization of energy use and performance test procedures for off and weak grid refrigerators is key to enable the comparison of different products and distinguish good quality refrigerators from the inferior ones. In this respect, local circumstances are very relevant, such as the quality of the electricity grid and the variation in solar conditions. An important objective of the standard will be to integrate these circumstances, ensuring the right off or weak grid refrigerator for the right location.”\nFor more information, contact patrick.beks@re-gent.nl"

Many organizations are applying for IECEE conformity assessment certification to verify that the requirements of IEC 62443 have been met. \nIECEE provides a framework for assessments in line with IEC 62443, which specifies requirements for security capabilities, whether technical (security mechanisms) or process (human procedures) related. To achieve this, two evaluations can be done, of an applicant’s security capabilities, which are used to develop, integrate and/or maintain specific products or solutions:\n\n\nevaluate an applicant’s ability to provide IEC 62443 compliant security capabilities\nevaluate that IEC 62443 compliant security capabilities have been applied to either a specific product, automation solution, or industrial automation control system.\n\nSuccessful recipients receive the IECEE industrial cyber security capability certificate of conformity.\nThe IEC 62443 series was developed to secure industrial automation and control systems (IACS) throughout their lifecycle. It currently includes nine standards, technical reports, and technical specifications. \nIEC 62443 is a horizontal standard, which reflects the fact that IACS are found in an ever-expanding range of domains and industries. They include, for example, the power grid, hospitals, and transport. \nThe standard was developed because IT cyber security measures are not always appropriate for IACS, which must run continuously to check that each component in an operational system is functioning correctly. Compared to IT systems, they have different performance and availability requirements and equipment lifetime. \nCyber-attacks on IT and OT systems often have different consequences. The effects of cyber-attacks on IT are generally economic, while cyber-attacks on OT systems, including critical infrastructure, can impact the environment or even threaten public health and lives.\nIEC 62443 takes a risk-based approach to cyber security, which is based on the concept that it is neither efficient nor sustainable to try to protect all assets in equal measure. Instead, users must identify what is most valuable and requires the greatest protection and identify vulnerabilities. \nThe standard series stresses the importance of ensuring that this process is very closely aligned with organizational goals because mitigation decisions may have a serious impact on operations. The aim is to implement defence-in-depth measures to ensure business continuity.\nBoth IEC 62443 and the IECEE programme help to protect critical infrastructure. In this way, they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16, which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies.\n\nInternational standards such as IEC 62443 are based on industry best practices and reached by consensus. Conformity assessment is often seen as completing the process by ensuring that the standard has been implemented correctly.\n\n \nRelated content\nCyber security, a key focus for certification \nUnderstanding IEC 62443"

With the participation of Timor-Leste, a total of 174 countries are now a part of the IEC community.\nThe National Authority for Electricity Public Institute (ANE I.P.) will serve as the Timor-Leste representative to the IEC. Since its establishment in 2021, ANE I.P. is responsible for supervising and regulating the national electricity sector.\nAccording to Ruben Freitas, President of the ANE I.P., “For a new institution such as ANE, I.P., we face many challenges related to regulation, standardizations, and other related issues. However, by taking part in the IEC Affiliate Country Programme we hope to find solutions and learn from IEC experts as well as from the experiences in other countries.”\nBenefits of joining ACP\nSince its launch in 2001, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme has provided numerous countries with the opportunity to participate in the international standardization and conformity assessment activities of the IEC without the financial burden of membership.\n“We are happy to welcome Timor-Leste into the IEC community. By joining the Affiliate Country Programme, Timor-Leste is taking an important step in developing a robust infrastructure for standardization and conformity assessment,” notes Aristea Kyriakati, Head of the IEC Affiliate Country Programme.\nParticipants are encouraged to adopt and reference IEC publications in their national laws and regulations and can select up to 200 IEC Standards free of any commercial consideration, for national adoption. In addition, experts can participate in IEC technical committees and receive guidance on the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. Training and mentoring programmes are also available.\nOnce an affiliate country has established a National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) and has adopted at least 50 IEC Standards, it is eligible to increase its quota of free IEC Standards for national adoption as well as nominate additional experts to participate in IEC technical work.\nOvercoming challenges\nCurrently, ANE I.P is preparing a draft law on sustainable energy systems which would generate a capacity of 450 megawatts. However, no official national standards have yet been adopted for regulating the electricity sector. \nAnother challenge relates to the quality of electrical and electronics products which can vary considerably between brands. According to Mr. Freitas, “People are complaining about the quality of products. Therefore, we would like to ensure products safety and performance.”\nHe concludes by noting, “We believe that the Affiliate Country Programme is a very useful tool to meet our national objectives, relating to standardization and conformity assessment.”"

        "content": "IEC Technical Committee 100, which publishes standards in the field of audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment, has published a key document on haptic technology. Haptics is the science and technology of transmitting and understanding information through the sense of touch.\nThe word haptic originates from the ancient Greek haptikos, which means able to sense or touch. Haptic technology was invented during the second part of the 20th Century and is now used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from wearable wristbands and watches to game controllers and interactive screens.\nIt is both a way of enhancing people’s experience of multimedia systems through touch and also making our world more understandable to the visually impaired.\nA new publication has been issued by IEC Technical Committee 100, IEC TR 63344, which establishes a conceptual model of standardization for haptic multimedia systems. Haptics are used in electrical appliances such as computer interfaces, automobiles, and entertainment devices such as haptic vests or joysticks.\nMany use cases are listed and various haptic technologies are defined in the document, including ultrasound technology.\nHaptic systems can use ultrasounds instead of vibrations to transmit sensations. Ultrasonic waves are sent through the air to collide at specific focal points which can create haptic sensations.\n\nIEC TC 100 Chair Ulrike Haltrich explains: “TC 100 has been publishing standards for audio, video and multimedia systems which traditionally were designed to meet people’s visual or auditive expectations.\n\"Haptic technology is adding the sense of touch to the multimedia experience. The need to standardize this new area is of paramount importance, to ensure performance and safety targets are met, as well as to help with the interoperability of different hardware systems.”\n \nRead more\nHow haptic technology is changing the multimedia experience\n(by Ulrike Haltrich in e-tech)"

        "content": "Technology has an important role in helping the elderly remain independent . For example, technology makes it possible to continue living at home safely or help monitor health. It can be used to facilitate socialization and improve self-care.\nA new book, Internet of Things for Human-Centered Design edited by Sofia Scataglini, Silvia Imbesi and Gonçalo Marques, explores how the Internet of Things (IoT) can be applied to Human-Centred Design (HCD) projects for older users to enhance their care, health and well-being.\nOne of the book’s editors, Sofia Scataglini, an IEC TC 124 expert and a 2018 Young Professional, provides further insight.\nCan you tell us more about your new book?\nThe present focus on the ageing population is creating new prospects for the development of niche solutions for older users who are beginning to experience physical and cognitive decline but are still autonomous and want to maintain their autonomy for as long as feasible. This book examines and evaluates the most recent services, products, technologies and environments designed exclusively for older people.\nHow can technology be used to improve elder care?\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the utilization of novel technologies such as new generation sensors and microcontrollers that are connected to the Internet. These systems can be utilized for a variety of ambient assisted living (AAL) applications as the world's population ages.\nThe combination of older users' needs with the opportunity provided by current revolutionary technologies allows research institutions, stakeholders and academia to target and build new solutions for the elderly, ensuring their well-being, health and care while also improving their quality of life. AAL architectures are designed to address the demands of older people in order to keep them as independent as possible.\nWhat are some of the challenges?\nBecause many elders have little prior familiarity with technology, mastering these new techniques might be difficult. Seniors have a narrower frame of reference, making it more difficult for them to assimilate new information. As a result, they may feel isolated and lonely if they do not have the opportunity for communicating using the technology. This is especially evident during the pandemic when digital skills are increasingly necessary.\nWhat is the role of standards?\nConcerns about AAL have been addressed by the relevant IEC Systems Committee (IEC SyC AAL). The aim of this SyC is to promote AAL system and service safety, security, privacy and cross-vendor interoperability, as well as to foster standardization to increase usability and accessibility.\nStandardization efforts are crucial to assisting the elderly and disabled in remaining as self-sufficient as possible. International standards guarantee the safety, reliability and compatibility of numerous technologies."

        "abstract": "Find out more about a recent webinar that explored the role of standards and policy to achieve resource efficiency and a circular transition in the European Union and India.",
        "content": "The circular economy offers a new approach to achieving sustainable economic growth. Replacing a linear model where products are made, used and disposed, the circular economy calls for a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived. It is based on circular mechanisms in which products and materials can be reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured and, ultimately, recycled.\nAchieving a circular economy has been a key objective of the European Union as part of its Green Deal and its Circular Economy Action Plan. To further strengthen its commitment to the circular economy, the EU adopted a Joint Declaration on Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy with the Indian Government in July 2020. Through this declaration, the EU and India seek to support and strengthen their dialogue and cooperation in this area.\nTo better understand the role of standards and policy to achieve resource efficiency and a circular transition, the European Union’s Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI), the Seconded European Standards Experts in India (SESEI), CEN-CENELEC and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) organized a webinar on this topic.\nAmong the speakers, the IEC Ambassador for the SDGs, Vimal Mahendru provided a presentation on the work of the IEC in helping to achieve a circular transition. As he noted, “For the IEC, circularity is at the heart of what we are trying to build. We started with standards addressing energy efficiency, and now we are working in material efficiency. This brings the IEC and IEC Standards at the centre of enabling the circular economy.”\nPromoting material efficiency\nMaterial efficiency is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the preservation of materials as well as the recovery and recycling of material at the end of the product life. Material efficiency can be placed into a hierarchy during a product’s use and waste phases with the most favourable strategies calling for the design of products associated with a longer product life using the least amount of natural resources, while the least favourable strategies represent the loss of a material resource by incinerating the material and recovering its energy. \nAccording to Mahendru, “there can be standards at each stage. The IEC is focusing on a number of standards from the eco-design of products that embed circular economy principles to the sustainable management of e-waste.”\nHowever, as Mahendru notes, consensus is essential. “Standards have no value if they do not have consensus from all stakeholders who are going to use it. By achieving buy-in, it becomes much easier to implement standards. For this reason, building consensus is critical.” \nWork of ACEA and IEC TC 111\nIn addition to the product specific standards developed by IEC technical committees, IEC TC 111 develops horizontal standards related to environmental issues that are relevant to all products. Currently IEC TC 111 is developing a number of standards related to the circular economy including general method for assessing the proportion of reused components in products, guidance on material circularity considerations in environmentally conscious design and sustainable management of waste.\nThe Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) provides guidance to the Standardization Management Board (SMB) on issues related to the environment, including the circular economy and material efficiency. ACEA has been informing the IEC community about the circular economy and the role of standards.\nGetting involved\nIn the conclusion to his presentation, Mahendru called for engagement. “I strongly believe that we all inherited a wonderful earth. Unfortunately, we cannot say this is the case for our children and grandchildren.”\n“Are we really proud of the world we are leaving behind as our legacy? Can we leave it to governments to find a solution? Change must also happen at an individual level. We must ask ourselves how each of us can contribute and be more responsible about our individual footprint. I would like all of us to work together so that our grandchildren inherit a better world.”"

        "content": "Since 1970, the IEC has published a series of standards to ensure the safety of household appliances. Known as the 60335 series, it is comprised of two parts, with the first part consisting of the general safety requirements for all appliances while the second part addresses the requirements for specific device types.\nAs the number of these household appliances multiplies and their complexity increases, the IEC has regularly updated the general safety requirements: IEC 60335-1, Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety – Part I: General Requirements. A sixth edition of the standard was published in 2020.\nThis standard provides protection against many types of hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation when appliances are used under normal conditions. It also considers how electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.\n“Household appliance safety plays a big role for society considering the impact these products have on the day-to-day life of consumers and their dispersal across society. While the electrical appliance industry is mature, our safety standards require frequent updates in order to address the addition of new features and technology advancements to existing appliances,” notes Randi Myers, the Project Leader who managed the updates to the latest edition of IEC 60335-1.\nNew editions to the IEC 60335 series\nNew editions for several safety standards for specific household appliances have recently been published to align with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1. To better identify and understand the changes made between the current and previous editions, these standards are available as Commented versions. They include:\nIEC 60335-2-10 CMV, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-10: Particular requirements for floor treatment machines and wet scrubbing machines\nIEC 60335-2-13 CMV, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-13: Particular requirements for deep fat fryers, frying pans and similar appliances\nIEC 60335-2-35 CMV, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-36: Particular requirements for commercial electric cooking ranges, ovens, hobs and hob elements\nIEC 60335-2-59 CMV, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-59: Particular requirements for insect killers\nIEC 60335-2-64 CMV, Household and similar electrical appliances - Safety - Part 2-64: Particular requirements for commercial electric kitchen machines\nAs Myers notes, “We are really excited with the speed at which we have been able to publish the new editions of these standards. By making available a Commented version, users will be able to understand why we have made certain changes.”\nThese standards have been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 61 which addresses the safety of household and similar electrical appliances.\nPublication of Commented versions\nThe Commented version clearly identifies the differences between the previous version of the standard and the new version and also provides comments on each of the main technical changes. By doing so, the IEC seeks to provide the standards user with the rationale for each of the key changes."

        "content": "The IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme offers a platform for the IEC community to share knowledge in standardization and conformity assessment. Under the aegis of the IEC Affiliate Country Programme, affiliate countries learn from the experience of IEC Members by establishing customized objectives that they can achieve together. \nThe IEC Mentoring Programme offers an opportunity for members to share information with affiliate countries and support their engagement in international standardisation. Participants define their objectives prior to the launch of the partnership and have the autonomy to determine the most suitable approach to adopt in order to achieve these objectives.\nIn the past two years, three mentorship agreements have been signed within the framework of the IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme:\n\nThe National Committee (NC) of Australia and the National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) of Cambodia\nThe NC of Brazil and the NEC of the Dominican Republic\nThe NC of the United Kingdom and the NEC of Namibia\n\nSince the launch of the Programme in 2013, 17 partnerships have been concluded.\nEmpowering affiliate countries\nThe IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme is a two-year partnership that offer an in-depth immersion into IEC technical work. The aim is to guide and reinforce the affiliate country’s National Electrotechnical Committee, increase their stakeholder engagement and better understand the IEC standardization process.\nAccording to Oliver Hateley, BSI Senior Policy Manager, “The UK has a long-track record of standards development, and we want to share our experience and expertise to help other NCs build their capacity and capability to participate within the international standards system.”\nFabián Yaksic, the NC President for Brazil agrees. “Being able to share with professionals from developing countries our experience in the standardization processes is very important, because it allows them to see how to mobilize their professionals, in the processes of the development or revision of standards, how to take advantage of this important source of knowledge, how to achieve their greater participation in these processes.”\nTailored to the needs of affiliate countries\nThe IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme understands that national and regional requirements can impact the implementation of IEC Standards. For this reason, the programme considers the specific requirements of the affiliate country and proposes a mentor that can understand them and help achieve the specific objectives of the mentee.\nAs notes Clare Hobern, NC Secretary for Australia, “When mentoring another country, the most important thing is to ensure that we are providing support where it is needed and asked for while respecting that working styles and approaches to standards development can differ from country to country.”\nThe programme also seeks to match countries with similar backgrounds. According to Juan Manuel Hernandez Zarate, NC Assistant Secretary for Mexico, “We were a natural fit because Mexico and Ecuador have similar customs, speak the same language and Ecuador even faced the similar challenges as Mexico when we first began our participation in the IEC.”\nBruno Berken, former NC Secretary for France agrees. “After the successful mentoring programme with Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal was the natural second step for us. Both our historical and cultural heritage led us to have many French stakeholders present in Senegal and when the Senegalese NEC asked for a mentor, our answer was obviously positive.”\nStrengthening the IEC community\nWhile the IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme brings tangible benefits to the affiliate country, it also helps to strengthen the IEC community. Stronger participation by affiliate countries within the IEC community leads to greater diversity and the ability to develop standards that satisfy the requirements of a large number of countries.\nAccording to Hateley, “The benefits of the mentoring programme for our NC are twofold: firstly, it provides us with a unique insight into standards development in another country and how international standards are viewed by another user-base; secondly, in the longer-term, having strong participation of affiliates like Namibia and greater diversity in the IEC system as a whole will lead to better quality IEC deliverables.”\nFor many of the IEC representatives, they were able to gain real benefits from the programme. As Christian Gabriel, IEC NC Secretary for Austria notes, “Besides getting more visibility for your NC you will foster the understanding of the world of electrotechnical standardization, and you will pave the way for more bilateral dialogues. This in terms of business, lobbying and friendship.”\nBerken highlights the benefits that the programme brings to the NCs in terms of networking opportunities. He recounted a story about an IEC TC 31 mirror committee meeting in France which included the participation of representatives from their mentee, Côte d’Ivoire. “When the meeting started, we had, as usual, only 5 participants in the meeting room. But, as the participants messaged their colleagues that there were experts present from Côte d’Ivoire, the experts who were not in attendance changed their plans and joined... By the end of the meeting, more than 30 French experts showed up with the intention to exchange their carte de visite with our African friends and to start networking with them.”\nHe concludes, “It is an important step in the exchange of good practices with a fellow NC or affiliate and that relation will last forever. We believe that the future of the IEC relies on its capacity to develop its network in as many countries as possible.” Hobern agrees. “Becoming a mentor is a really great way to look beyond your national borders and understand how the IEC can make impact in all corners of the world.”"

        "content": "The Online Standards Development (OSD) platform has reached an important milestone with the first draft standard now ready for its initial committee review. IEC 60512-28-100 ED3 is the first draft standard prepared using the OSD editing tools to reach the committee stage. It will now be reviewed by the members of IEC Subcommittee 48B on electrical connectors.\nThe OSD platform is a joint development between IEC and ISO to provide standards developers with digital tools to streamline the process for drafting and editing international standards. According to Peter Fischer, the Project Leader for IEC 60512-28-100 ED3, “The platform is still in the early stage, but it is a very helpful tool to improve collaboration between experts by adding content and resolving comments.”\nWith the OSD editor, it is possible for standards writers to collaborate directly on the same document. As Fischer notes, “All experts could contribute directly inside the document at any time they wanted. By logging in everybody could review the new content or the proposed changes which would then be resolved during regular meetings once a month. The exchanges were simplified by this tool, and nothing got lost as the complete track change is available.”\nOne of the most useful aspects of the OSD editor has been the ability for standards-writers to concentrate on the content of the standard. “The editor and the project team can focus on the content and do not have to worry about the formatting and the related rules,” remarks Fischer. He also welcomes the ease with which track changes can be followed and discussed.\nThe Committee Draft 48B/2937/CD is now ready for commenting by the members of IEC SC 48B where it will be reviewed for a 12-week period. Because the committee commenting system is not yet available on the OSD platform, the draft standard is circulated for comments using the conventional process.\nRelease of new features\nNew features are regularly made available on the OSD platform. In early December, early adopters benefited from new options for numbering, cross referencing term entries, increased usability of tables and new \"unlock\" features. The next set of features are due for release in early 2022. It is expected that the commenting system in the OSD platform will be ready in June 2022.\nFurther information about the OSD platform is available on the OSD platform webpage and from a recent webinar with an overview of the project, including a live preview of the tool.\nFor more information, contact authoring@iec.ch to see how you can participate."

        "content": "With the pressures and challenges of the past two years, it’s important to reflect on just how significant the work of the IEC Technical Committee 106 and IEEE experts has been in delivering new standards for the evolving 5G ecosystem and wireless power transfer technologies. \nWith the new 5G mmWave spectrum now available in many countries, and new 5G devices being launched globally, TC 106 has just published the final draft international standard (FDIS) for IEC/IEEE 63195, the new IEC and IEEE series of testing methods that cover computation and measurement for frequencies from 6GHz – 300GHz.  This is significant for device manufactures, regulators and the public to ensure the very latest 5G technology has the very latest test methods.  \nA key strategy for TC 106 and the IEEE is to be ahead of the game when it comes to developing test methods for 5G, and we did this in 2018 with the first mmWave device testing Technical Report and this will now be superseded in 2022 with the full international standards.\nHarnessing the collaborative power of academia, industry, governments and testing laboratories all working together, the IEC is also finalizing its latest technical standard IEC 62232 Edition 3 for the assessment of electromagnetic fields of EMF levels around 5G base stations.  The draft achieved a 100% positive vote in 2021, along with some very important technical feedback which is now being addressed.  \nThe new standard will be published in 2022 delivering the latest test methods for 5G networks including beamforming, actual power assessments, and case studies illustrating the latest test and monitoring methods. Delivering these great results requires significant efforts by all members and in the past two years we have recognized outstanding contributions with the IEC 1906 Award to five members:\nKanako Wake from the Japan National Committee for her outstanding leadership and dedication as convenor of WG 9, leading the development of IEC TR 63377 for wireless power transfer test methods incorporating the latest assessment techniques.\nKai Niskala from the Finland National Committee for his outstanding leadership and dedication as co-convenor of JWG 12, which was decisive for the development of measurement techniques for 5G millimetre wave standards.\nJohn M. Roman from the United States of America for his outstanding leadership and dedication as co-convenor of JWG 11, which was decisive for the development of computation techniques for 5G millimetre wave standards.\nMarco Klingler from the France National Committee for his outstanding leadership and dedication as convenor of PT 62764-1, leading the development of IEC TS 62764-1 for the measurement of electromagnetic fields in the automotive environment applying the latest assessment techniques.\nSami Gabriel from the Great Britain National Committee for his outstanding leadership of JWG 13 and previous support in MT1, technical analysis and writing, and dedication including significant time with stakeholders has ensured a smooth transition from MT1 to the new JWG with the IEEE.\nThe past two years has thrown many challenges for everyone and I would like to acknowledge these very tough conditions for all members and administration teams.  The collaborative culture in TC 106 and the IEEE, where all members are looking out for each other and supporting one another, has really made a difference in achieving these quality standards.\nIn 2022, TC 106 and the IEEE will commence using the new online authoring tool which provides a significant step forward for committees to focus on content development, rather than the administrative tasks of formatting, circulations, combining comments and managing large files across many global contributors.   \nThis is a very exciting step forward as we have two new projects that commence very soon, and I look forward to sharing our experiences.  Thank you to the IEC Central Office and the online authoring systems development team for these exciting opportunities.\nI wish everyone a safe 2022.\nMike Wood, Chair IEC TC 106\n \nRead more \nTC 106 scope\nTC 106 in the IEC Blog\nIEC Standards development stages"

        "abstract": "While several big companies have pulled out of CES, which kicks off today in Las Vegas, the hype for wacky gadgets and smart tech is alive and well.",
        "content": "The pandemic might have impacted attendance at CES, but the buzz is still there, especially as the event is a physical one this year and people everywhere are keen to give the start of 2022 a boost  after last year's doom and gloom. What better way to start than with a forward looking tech show?\nSmart tech is one of the enduring trends and being able to control devices from afar, whether by voice or otherwise, is as enthralling as it has always been. This year, among the products on show, a smart light bulb which tracks sleeping patterns from afar or a voice- activated smart bath are expected to create some hype.\nSelf-driving technology remains one of the show stalwarts with a major US automobile manufacturer revealing its new autonomous prototype, while other vehicles such as a self driving tractor are expected to also capture the limelight.\nSpace tech is predicted to attract a lot of attention, with a US enterprise demonstrating a scaled-down version of a large inflatable space home. Named LIFE habitat, the structure can be folded into a launch vehicle and expand once it has reached its destination.\nRobotics are more than ever a key enabling technology, as the purchase of a leading US trend setting robotics company by a Korean giant demonstrated. Both will work on robot companions which can become our physical avatars in the metaverse, not only for gaming or space exploration  but also in areas such as smart manufacturing, where digital twins will probably be activated from afar by using robots.\nA UK company created quite a buzz with a humanoid robot which it claims is the most advanced human robot yet, with fluid movements and very realistic facial features mobility.\nThe metaverse is on everyone’s lips: a number of companies are introducing either gaming suits or smart glasses which enable us to better navigate the virtual environment where haptics are opening up new possibilities. \nIEC is paving the way for most of these technologies with a plethora of standards and publications.\nSmart lighting standards are published by IEC TC 34, which is developing a document on intelligent lighting products for lighting systems.\nThe joint technical committee of IEC and ISO, JTC 1, prepares standards relating to IT applications. Several of its subcommittees work in areas relevant to smart lighting systems, robotics and artificial intelligence. SC 41 prepares standards pertaining to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twin, including ISO/IEC 21823-1, which defines the framework for the interoperability of IoT systems. SC 35: User interfaces, publishes the ISO/IEC 30122 series which establishes the framework and general guidance for voice-command user interfaces. SC 35 has also set up a working group on affective computing. The technology allows for the use of chatbots and virtual assistants that have enhanced empathy and the ability to transform emotions into data. SC 42 prepares standards relating to artificial intelligence.\nAutonomous vehicles require sensors, cameras, radar systems and in some cases light detection and ranging (LIDAR), which is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances between objects.\nIEC Standards help to specify the safety and performance benchmarks for many of these devices. IEC TC 47, which produces some of the key standards relating to sensors, publishes IEC 62969, which deals with the general requirements of power interfaces for automotive vehicle sensors. IEC TC 100 publishes standards for audio, video and multimedia systems and has established Technical Area 17 focused on multimedia systems and equipment for vehicles. IEC TC 100/TA 17 issues IEC TS 63033-1, covering a technology which enables drivers to see all around their vehicles, from different perspectives. \nIEC TC 100 has also just issued a technical report to clarify the conceptual model of haptics used in multimedia systems. They are used in electrical appliances such as computer interfaces, automobiles, entertainment devices and communication and a number of use cases are listed and the various haptic technologies are defined."

        "content": "Artificial intelligence technologies have been moving into the mainstream thanks to rapid software and hardware improvements that have boosted computational performance, data storage capabilities and network bandwidth. They are driving the digital transformation of industry and society by satisfying demands for more intelligent services and analytics. \nThere are many examples of how AI is being deployed now to boost safety, efficiency and create new business models. AI expert systems are helping healthcare professionals make better decisions for patients with proper trustworthiness measures designed into the system. \nThe use of AI in the smart manufacturing sector is driving higher efficiencies by collecting and analyzing production data in real-time, allowing for deployment of predictive maintenance, as well as reducing equipment failure, increasing reliability and improving asset performance. Smart sensors are also transforming home and security applications.  \nApplications such as these rely on a variety of sophisticated algorithms. A new ISO/IEC Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 24372, aims to help users understand them.\nThe TR provides an overview of the state of the art of computational approaches for AI systems. It describes the main computational characteristics of AI systems, as well as the main algorithms and approaches used in AI systems, referencing use cases contained in ISO/IEC 24030.\nISO/IEC TR 24372 is the work of the IEC and ISO joint technical committee (SC 42) that develops international standards for artificial intelligence. Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nISO/IEC AI workshop\nAs SC 42’s work programme continues to evolve, new projects are expected across the board in the areas of AI data, trustworthiness, computational, and ethics.  Starting next year, SC 42 expects to launch an ISO/IEC AI workshop which will be run bi-annually.\nThe workshops will focus on the standards and the broader non-standards community interested in AI. The workshop goals are to promote and inform on the committee’s work as well as identify emerging trends, requirements, insights and opportunities that may help the next generation of SC 42 work, attract new stakeholders and provide a platform for discussion.\nRead more about the work of SC 42 here.\nAI multistakeholder conference in Geneva\nAnother focus of IEC work is the interplay between standardization, conformity assessment and regulation of AI. One of the key milestones will be a conference, jointly organized by the IEC and the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, taking place in Geneva, on 16 and 17 May.\nIt will build on the virtual workshop held in October last year that gathered standards experts, researchers and government representatives. The IEC believes that a multi-stakeholder approach is crucial in order to ensure that international standards benefit society, support a more sustainable planet and bolster prosperity for all."

        "content": "As 2021 comes to a close, we have rounded up the top stories of the year. These stories cover a wide range of topic, highlighting the many areas where IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems have an impact.\nThe most read stories on the IEC blog, listed in the order of their page views are as follows:\n1. Understanding IEC 62443\nThe IEC 62443 series was developed to secure industrial automation and control systems (IACS) throughout their lifecycle. It currently includes nine standards, technical reports (TR) and technical specifications (TS).\nIEC 62443 was initially developed for the industrial process sector but IACS are found in an ever-expanding range of domains and industries, such as power and energy supply and distribution, and transport. IACS technologies are central to critical infrastructure. Read more\n2. The invention of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nRaymond Damadian, the inventor of the first magnetic resonance scanning machine celebrates his 85th birthday on March 16. Damadian, a physician, performed the first full-body scan of a human being in 1977.\nThe Nobel committee’s decision to omit Damadian from the 2003 medicine prize for the invention of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was viewed as controversial. “For some, his [Damadian’s] absence from this year's accolades is conspicuous,” wrote the medical journal, The Lancet, at the time. Read more\n3. The IEC 61850 Standard for hydro power\nTo this day, the main source of renewable energy remains hydro power. A key IEC 61850 Standard specifies the role of this much relied upon source of energy and helps it interoperate with the electrical network as it gets digitalized and automated.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hydropower represents 20% of energy generation worldwide. In many countries around the world, it is the biggest source of electrical energy. In Norway for instance, more than 90% of the country’s electrical needs are met by hydro power. Read more\n4. China boosts renewable energy results in 2020\nThe latest REN 21 Renewables Global Status Report, which paints a worldwide picture of how renewable energies (REs) were produced and consumed in 2020, has been published. IEC, which is one of the report’s partnering organizations, summarizes a few of its key findings.\nAs governments worldwide instituted lockdowns in 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19, economies slumped and energy consumption plummeted. Overall, primary energy demand worldwide fell around 4% during the year, resulting in a 5,8% drop in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions – the largest percentage decrease since World War II. Read more\n5. New commented version of standard on classification of areas for Ex environments\nThe IEC has published the third edition of IEC 60079-10-1, Explosive atmospheres –Part 10-1: Classification of areas – Explosive gas atmospheres. A commented version of the standard is available, highlighting all changes from the previous edition as well as providing comments explaining the most relevant changes. The commented version is meant to make use of the standard easier for all stakeholders.\nThe new edition is published by IEC SC 31J, a subcommittee of IEC Technical Committee 31 which prepares international standards relating to the use of equipment, including area classification, the selection and installation, inspection and maintenance, repair, overhaul and reclamation of equipment where there is a hazard due to the possible presence of explosive atmospheres of gases and vapours or combustible dusts. Read more\n6. Women at IEC campaign kicks off\nAs we prepare to celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on February 11, it is increasingly acknowledged that standards are largely made by men for men. Women are under- represented in Technical Committees, and very few of them have become Chairs. They also represent a tiny percentage inside the governing bodies of the IEC.\nA recent report published by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) highlights that standards fail to protect women as much as men, leading to a greater number of fatalities among women. But change is hopefully afoot. Read more\n7. Limiting halogenated flame retardants in Europe\nSince 1 March, it is no longer possible to use halogenated flame retardants in electronic display enclosures and stands within the European Union. This includes equipment such as computer monitors, televisions, and digital signage displays with a screen measuring more than 100 cm².\nThis new requirement is one of a set of new eco-design requirements approved by the European Commission in October 2019 as part of their Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC). Other requirements include rules regarding the repairability of household appliances and product labelling. This is part of an effort by the European Commission to promote the objectives of a circular economy in Europe. Read more\n8. Moving ahead on standardization for digital twin\nAccording to consultancies Gartner and Deloitte, a digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world entity or system. It is an evolving digital profile of the historical and current behaviours of an object or process.\nThe technology is used across a wide variety of industrial sectors, from smart manufacturing to power utilities and smart grids as well as smart buildings and smart cities. It enables organizations to solve physical issues faster by detecting them sooner and predict outcomes to a much higher degree of accuracy, as well as build better products. Read more\n9. An interchangeable charging solution for all consumer electronic devices is here\nAfter the successful introduction of a common charging solution for mobile smartphones (based on USB technologies), in 2011, the IEC published a common charging interoperability solution in 2016, which went beyond smartphones to also include other electronic devices such as tablets and certain laptops. This solution is now becoming widely available in global markets and realizing the policy goals of e-waste reduction and increased user convenience.\nThe IEC has now issued an update to the common charging interoperability solution (IEC 63002, which is based on the latest UBS technologies) that will support increasing adoption in an even larger number of electronic devices. With it, different product chargers implementing this solution can be used with any electronic device that also implements this solution. The technology is backwards and forwards compatible, safe and supports future innovation ensuring e-waste reduction and long-term user convenience. Read more\n10. IEC efforts to curb e-waste\nThe ubiquity of electric and electronic products has resulted in growing volumes of e-waste. According to the latest Global E-waste Monitor, 53,6 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste was generated in 2019. At current rates, a projected 74,7 million tonnes of e-waste will be reached by 2030.\nThe cost of e-waste is high for the environment. If not properly disposed, e-waste releases toxic substances that can seep into the air, water and soil. As notes Christophe Garnier, Chair of IEC TC 111 which develops horizontal environmental standards for electrical and electronic products, “E-waste is a global topic affecting not only the countries using the electrical and electronic equipment that generates the waste, but also, and very importantly, those countries that collect e-waste for end-of-life treatment.” Read more"

        "content": "Located in the desert of Idaho, around 30 kilometres southeast of Arco, is the world's first breeder reactor. Seventy years ago, on 20 December 1951, it also became the first power plant in the world to produce usable electricity through atomic fission.  \nThe experimental breeder reactor known as EBR-I produced sufficient electricity to illuminate four 200-watt light bulbs and subsequently generated sufficient electricity to power its building.  EBR-I was decommissioned in 1964 and turned into a museum, which is open for visitors from late May until early September.\nNowadays, nuclear energy provides a source of carbon-free electricity generation. Following the 1986 Chernobyl and the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant disasters, nuclear energy began to be phased out or not adopted in the first place in many nations.\nRecently, however, there has been a rethink in some parts of the world. Nuclear energy is making a comeback in the decarbonization strategies of some countries as a contributor to the production of carbon-free electricity​​​​​.\nAccording to the World Nuclear Association, about 100 reactors are on order or planned, while over 300 more are under consideration. Most reactors presently planned are in Asia and France, where 56 nuclear reactors currently provide some 70% of electricity.\nNuclear projects continue to be developed because renewable energy production and storage are still not sufficient to ensure continuous grid stability. \nThe main concerns about nuclear power plants are safety and security. The IEC has actively developed International Standards for the safety and security of nuclear plants for decades.\nIEC TC 45: Nuclear instrumentation started its work in the 1950s, and IEC SC 45A: Instrumentation, control and electrical power systems of nuclear facilities, from 1960. These standards are consistent and coherent with the high-level principles established consensually by the authorities of the member states of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nIn addition, IEC TC 65 and IEC TC 57 develop international standards that apply to nuclear power plants. \nIEC TC 65 is responsible for the IEC 62443 family of standards that provides guidance on cyber security for critical infrastructure, including nuclear power stations.  IEC TC 57 develops the IEC 61850 series of publications for communication networks and systems for power utility automation and the IEC 60870 series for telecontrol equipment and systems.\n \nRelated content\nNet zero emission objective requires new approach"

Among many others, they are responsible for the Emmy-winning JPEG and MPEG standards.\nOne of the key challenges for JTC 1 is to keep pace with digital transformation and the development of new technologies that continue to transform both our lives and livelihoods. In the past quarter-century, the internet, smartphones and social media have revolutionized communications. \nIt is bracing to think that there are now standards for self-driving vehicles, digital twin technology and augmented reality. Not that long ago, these technologies were the stuff of science fiction. \nNext year, JTC 1 is expected to complete an important new standard on quantum computing terminology and vocabulary.  Work will also begin on standardizing technologies related to brain-computer interfaces. \nIt is the job of the Joint JTC 1 Advisory Group on Emerging Technology and Innovation (JETI) to find and recommend opportunities like these to JTC 1. The group’s aim is to facilitate standards development for future emerging and innovation technologies. \n“As long as the adoption of ICT technologies continues to spread rapidly into all industries, the role and responsibilities of ICT standards will become more important,” explains JETI Convenor Dr. Seungyun Lee.\nJETI, which was established in 2017, conducts an annual survey within the JTC 1 community to identify priority areas and future work items. The latest survey has highlighted 25 priority areas, ranging from green tech and self-driving cars to telemedicine and e-sport.\n“The list is broad, so we will have to decide which areas need urgent attention and see how we can streamline overlapping topics where possible,” says Dr. Lee.\nThe top five, which received the highest priority scores, are data privacy, edge cloud computing, empowering AI on the edge, digital health, and remote workforce technologies. JTC 1 subcommittees are already addressing some of these items, such as data privacy and edge cloud computing, while others may become new work items in 2022.\nJETI also plans to publish a new technology trend report in 2022 on the topic of intelligent computing and to publish a new JTC 1 white paper on digital manufacturing. \nFind out more about JETI"

She noted the results of a recent survey of affiliate countries confirming that while IEC conformity assessment certificates may be used among industry, a vast majority of affiliate countries have not formally referenced IEC conformity assessment certificates within their national legislation; they would like more consultation and guidance to be able to do so.\nWhy conformity assessment?\nAccording to Trond Sollie, IEC Ambassador for Affiliate training in Conformity Assessment, conformity assessment provides regulators and consumers with the necessary confidence that the products they are using meet with recognized standards for safety and other risks. Conformity assessment also helps to promote international trade by reducing the barriers for product to enter into a given market.\nWithin the IEC, there are four conformity assessment systems:\n\nIEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE)\nIEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components (IECQ)\nIEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications (IECRE)\nIEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres (IECEx)\n\nOverview on IECEx\nIECEx provides a global platform for IECEx approved certification bodies and testing laboratories to issue international IECEx reports and certificates related to equipment, services, persons operating in explosive atmospheres that comply with international ISO and IEC standards. It operates the following separate certification schemes:\n\nIECEx Certified Equipment Scheme\nIECEx Certified Services Scheme\nIECEx Certificate of Personal Competence Scheme\n\n-      IIndustry, regulators and consumers are assured that activities involving flammable and combustible materials are handled under safe conditions. Examples where such assurances are necessary include fuelling stations and storage facilities, oil and gas exploration and processing, coal mining, food and pharmaceutical manufacturing as well as grain handling, storage and transport.\nAs the Chair of IECEx, Paul Meanwell, notes “there is no need for countries to create their own conformity assessment schemes. This hard work has been done for them by IEC over the last forty years.” He notes that it is the only one of its kind at the global level. \nIECEx certificates of conformity are issued live via the IECEx Online Certificate System where the electronic version shown on the official IECEx website is the master original version with all certificates available for free public viewing in real time.\nConformity of Equipment, components and assemblies\nManufacturers and their customers benefit from the single testing of products based on international standards without additional national and regional requirements which generally increase costs without enhancing safety. As the member of IECEx Executive, Dr Thorsten Arnhold noted, “Our customers are on a global level and want a single engineering approach.”\nFor equipment to receive an IECEx certificate of conformity, products are required to pass relevant type tests in order to be issued a test report from a recognized testing lab. In addition, an IEC Certification Body is responsible for the audit of the product manufacturer’s quality management system. If both are deemed positive, then the IECEx equipment certificate of conformity can be issued. This also applies for component certificates and unit certificates.\nIECEx has introduced a fast-track process in which the certificates and reports issues by IECEx Certification Bodies (CB) and Test Labs (TLs) shall be recognized by other certified CBs and TLs. IECEx endorsement is recognized by all national bodies. An online database is available with a searchable list of IECEx certificates issued.\nConformity of Ex related services \nIECEx Certificates of Conformity cover Ex related services including repairs and overhaul as well as inspections and maintenance. IECEx Certification Bodies assess and audits the activity of the service provider with the aim of issuing a Facility Assessment Report (FAR) and a Service Facility Certificate. These certificates can be searched on a database on the IECEx website.\nThe repair, overhaul and reclamation section of this scheme has provided certification since 2007. It ensures that repair workshops have facilities, systems and competent staff according to the hugely popular International IEC 60079-19 standard ensuring that repairs made to equipment allow the equipment to continue to comply with the relevant international standards. The inspection and maintenance section of the scheme, which has been operational since 2015, covers all types of inspections based on IEC 60079-17 and IECEx Operational Documents.\nConformity Personnel competence\nInadequate operator skills have been identified as one of the causes resulting in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. In order to manage all areas of risk, IECEx certifies those who design, install, inspect, operate, maintain and repair the Ex-equipment.\nThe IECEx Personnel Competence Scheme is a global scheme that recognizes that knowledge and skills are needed for safe working in the Ex-sector where risk must be managed. It is based on competencies which encompass qualifications, experience and relevant training that enable safe working on or near Ex equipment by issuing an IECEx Certificate of Conformity to persons that have demonstrated their capability of conducting Ex related work in accordance with the relevant International Standards (eg IEC 60079 series)."

        "content": "It was a busy year for TC 14. The committee published three standards in 2021, new editions which are expected to fill an important gap for users in the market. The first two address methods of cooling reactors whereas the third deals with various monitoring devices.\nThey include the first editions of IEC 60076-22-5 relating to electric pumps for transformers; IEC 60076-22-6 concerning electric fans for transformers and IEC 60076-22-8, relating to devices suitable for use in communication networks. \nThe first standard covers electric pumps used in the cooling circuits of power transformers and reactors. It outlines requirements for the electrical and hydraulic performance, mechanical design, routine testing and type testing of these pumps. The standard concerns rotodynamic pumps driven by a squirrel cage induction motor that is immersed in the insulating liquid. A squirrel cage is a form of rotor used in small electric motors, resembling a cylindrical cage.\nIEC 60076-22-6 deals with the electric fans used in the cooling circuits of power transformers and reactors. The electric fans concerned by this document are for use on liquid to air coolers and for blowing out radiators. The document outlines the operation requirements specific to each equipment as well as the preferred dimensions relevant for interchangeability and uniform fan assembly and the type and routine tests to be performed.\nIEC 60076-22-8 covers an exhaustive selection of devices that are currently used in communication networks. The communication network itself is not standardized as part of the document. The devices concerned include, for instance, dissolved gas analysis instruments, or electrical and electronic liquid temperature measuring equipment.\n“TC 14, despite the difficulties imposed by the pandemic, has done its business within expectations. Besides the continuation of existing projects with visible progress, several new projects were started in 2021. The use of virtual tools for our work became normal for the whole community and the thought that the pandemic would have reached us without having such tools is indeed scary”, comments Christoph Ploetner, Chair of TC 14."

        "content": "The popular imagination associates cyber attacks with stealing data or blocking websites, but the immediate consequences are not always confined to the digital realm. They can include bodily injury and even environmental catastrophes. \nCyber attacks could cut off the supply of electricity to hospitals, homes, schools and factories. A number of incidents in recent years demonstrate not only that the threat is tangible, but also that on more than one occasion we have escaped incurring nightmare consequences by the skin of our teeth.\nIn 2000, a disgruntled job applicant hacked into a computerized waste management system in Australia, causing millions of litres of raw sewage to kill marine life as it spilled out into rivers. A cyber attack in Ukraine, in 2015, left nearly a quarter of a million people without electricity, in the middle of winter, when hackers infiltrated the electric utility’s SCADA system. \nUnfortunately, cyber security is too often understood only in terms of IT (information technology). Those responsible for security sometimes overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as energy, manufacturing, healthcare, or transport. \nThe growth of connected devices has accelerated the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT). From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that, unlike business systems, IACS are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nThat is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risks. Where IT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad” — in the world of OT, availability is of foremost importance. Priorities for OT environments focus on health and safety and protecting the environment. \nIn the event of an emergency in order to be able to protect personnel or to minimize the impacts of natural disasters, it is vital that operators can receive accurate and timely information and can quickly take appropriate actions, such as shutting off the power or shifting to backup equipment.  \nProtecting SCADA systems\nSCADA systems, which are used to oversee electric grids as well as plant and machinery in industrial installations, often rely on “security by obscurity”, reflecting the ingrained mindset that since no one knows or cares about their communications systems or their data, they don’t need to protect it. However, SCADA systems can now have widespread communication networks increasingly reaching directly or indirectly into thousands of facilities, with increasing threats (both deliberate and inadvertent) potentially causing serious harm to people and to equipment. \nThe retrofitting of appropriate and effective security measures has therefore become quite difficult for these SCADA systems. In the world of IT, for example, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs), are on the frontline of defence against malware. \nIDPSs are usually software applications that eavesdrop on network traffic. Depending on how they are configured, IDPSs can do everything from reporting intrusions to taking actions aimed at preventing or mitigating the impact of breaches. \nThe challenge with SCADA systems is how to distinguish between normal data and potentially intrusive data that could cause harm.\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges based on global best practices. IEC 62443 is designed to keep OT systems running. \nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series."

        "abstract": "A new IEC White paper highlights the standardization opportunities and challenges for quantum information technologies.",
        "content": "When is the right time to begin standardization work on new and emerging technologies?\nStarting too early risks stifling innovation by promoting immature or inferior technologies, as well as giving specific countries or companies an unfair advantage. Starting too late risks fragmentation and locking consumers into vertical markets, possibly at the cost of safety and efficiency. \nAccording to a new IEC White Paper on Quantum information technology (QIT), the right time to start is when a number of global companies have developed either commercial products or prototypes. At the same time, no standardization work can happen without a global pool of experts who are prepared to work together.\nThere must also be a consensus among multiple stakeholders, such as industry, consumers and regulators. Once these conditions have been met, other considerations include technological and market maturity, the level of risk, regulatory needs and the political climate. \nThe IEC White Paper points out that quantum technologies are at different levels of maturity. While quantum computing may still be 10 or 15 years away from going mainstream, quantum key distribution (QKD), for example, already offers well-established commercial solutions.\nQKD is a secure encryption method that encodes messages using the properties of light particles. The only way for hackers to unlock the key is to measure the particles, but the very act of measuring changes the behaviour of the particles, causing errors that trigger security alerts.\nIn the field of quantum sensing and metrology, a number of prototypes are under development around the world. These include the development of medical imaging solutions capable of detecting cancer cells that are five times smaller than anything state-of-the-art magnetic resonance machines can find.\nQuantum LiDAR prototypes promise to boost the safety of self-driving vehicles by eliminating blind spots and detecting objects at a distance of 200 Km or greater. Others are working on tools for underground exploration that will be capable of detecting sinkholes and volcanic activity that are currently invisible to the most sophisticated sensors. \nThe White Paper recommends that the IEC should develop a mechanism to assess when these and other emerging technologies are ready for standardization. This should happen in close collaboration with other organizations “to promote commercialization via a fair and open global marketplace”.\nThe authors argue that standards should not only be based on sound science but also need to be “driven by industry needs and be flexible enough not to prematurely eliminate competing technologies”.\nDownload your free copy of the IEC White Paper on Quantum Information Technology here."

        "content": "One hundred and twenty-five years ago, on 10 December 1896, the German scientist, Wilhelm Röntgen announced his discovery of X-rays. Röntgen sent copies of his manuscript and x-ray photographs to some of the world’s most prominent physicists, including Lord Kelvin, who later founded the IEC.\n\"I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted,” Kelvin wrote back to Röntgen. “I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made.\"\nNowadays, X-rays are one of a number of medical imaging techniques used in hospitals and clinics around the world. Techniques include X-ray imaging, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), among others.\nCT imaging systems use X-ray images that are then processed by a computer to produce tomographic images or “slices” to obtain three-dimensional views of internal organs. Nuclear imaging technologies are also used for tomography.\nUltrasound imaging uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of internal organs, vessels and tissues. It is considered a safe form of medical imaging technology and is perhaps best known for its use in prenatal scans, which show images of a foetus in the mother’s womb.\nMRI systems use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the body. Low-field MRI scanners use permanent magnets, making them the least expensive of these medical imaging technologies.\nMid- and high-field MRI scanners use superconducting magnets which need cooling at extremely low temperatures during operation. The benefits of MRI scans are lower risks to health and lower energy consumption than other technologies.\nSeveral IEC technical committees prepare international standards for many of the systems and technologies used and for the performance and safe operation of imaging equipment and systems. \nIEC Technical Committee 87, for example, prepares international standards for equipment and systems in the domain of ultrasonics.\nThe remit of IEC TC 62 is to prepare international standards and other publications concerning electrical equipment, electrical systems and software used in healthcare and their effects on patients, operators, other persons and the environment. The activities of two of its subcommittees focus on imaging equipment.\nThe task of IEC SC 62B is to prepare international publications for safety and performance for all kinds of medical diagnostic imaging equipment, as well as quality procedures to be applied during the lifetime of imaging equipment. Included is also the development of related terminology, concepts, terms and definitions.\nThe work of IEC SC 62C focuses on equipment for radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and radiation dosimetry. It includes the preparation of standards for the safety and performance of nuclear medicine equipment used for imaging."

These new features, part of release 1.6.0, offer new options for numbering, cross referencing term entries, increased usability of tables and new \"unlock\" features.\nAlternative numbering scheme\nIt will now be possible for technical committees to select the numbering scheme used for the tables and figures in their documents. Numbering can either be sequential throughout the publication or referenced based on the specific clause number.\nCross referencing term entries\nAs new terms are introduced into a draft document, it will now be possible to capture these terms for cross-referencing in the terms and definitions clause. This not only provides standards writers with an additional guarantee that all terms are correctly cross-referenced but also facilitates the drafting of the terms and definitions clause.\nIn addition, it will also be possible to provide sub-term entries (to a third level) for grouping within a single definition.\nIncreasing the usability of tables\nTables have also been improved with new selection and scrolling options. Tables for abbreviated terms can now be generated with one click. \nUnlock features\nIt is now possible to “unlock” draft documents with a single click for easy editing. Administrators can unlock all clauses in the document while authors can unlock the clauses for which they have editorial rights.\nThese new features are a further step forward in the process towards producing the Online Standards Development editor.\nAbout the OSD platform\nThe OSD platform is a joint development between IEC and ISO to provide standards developers with digital tools to streamline the process for drafting and editing international standards. These tools enhance efficiency and collaboration by allowing, for example, standards developers to work simultaneously on the same document and to easily access IEC resources.\nLearn more and get involved\nThis platform is currently being used by several technical committees whose feedback will ensure that the final platform is fit for purpose.

        "abstract": "City Information Modelling and Urban Digital Twins can be used to help city planners develop smart cities. A new IEC report helps to understand these technologies and their standardization needs.",
        "content": "Data and technology are the foundations of a smart city. Yet, the development of smart cities is complex, involving many different systems, types of data and sets of information as well the interactions between city systems and city stakeholders.\nCity Information Modelling (CIM) and Urban Digital Twins (UDT) are two types of technology-enabled practices that can be used to help city planners develop smart cities that are resilient, safe and liveable.\nTo better understand these technologies and their standardization needs, the IEC has published a new technology report, City information modelling and urban digital twins.\nDefining CIM and UDT\nCity Information Modelling is defined as the practice of using interactive digital technologies as part of the process of urban planning. The concept emerged as an evolution of building information modelling (BIM) which uses technology to generate a digital representation of a building. It requires the collection, analysis and visualization of data in order to be able to make informed decisions.\nUrban digital twins combine 3D city models with the dynamic data gathered using sensors and geospatial technologies to help us better understand our cities. It is based upon the concept of verisimilitude to develop a static structure with dynamic properties. While the origins of the technology are to be found in industrial and mechanical engineering, it was first used by NASA in the 1960s as a means for physically duplicating systems at ground level to match the systems in space.\nAccording to Chunlan Guo, a member of IEC System Committee on Smart Cities and editor of the new report, “Both CIM and UDT have the same aims of enabling better urban planning and city management by using data and smart technologies. Both of them provide solutions for data processing, urban analysis, design, simulation and modelling.”\nWhereas CIM starts from the perspective of the whole city, UDT focuses on the transformation of the physical into the virtual environment. \nThe role of standards\nBoth CIM and UDT are at early stages of adoption and face common challenges for their future development. These include data silos, the usability and usefulness of applications for stakeholders, interoperability and openness. Because models, data and software are important components for CIM and UDT, they will need to address issues related to data collection, data management and security sharing.\nThe report provides an overview of some of the areas where further standardization work is needed. It recommends that the following activities as priorities:\n\ndeveloping an integrated reference architecture for UDT and CIM\nenabling the connection of different types of city data needed by UDT and CIM\ncollecting a full set of use cases for different UDT/CIM applications in order identify standardization requirements\ndeveloping UDT and CIM platform standards that define their functions, interfaces and services\n\nAs Guo remark, “To develop effective standards for CIM and UDT, collaboration with other standards development organizations is vital. Each organization has its specific expertise, and the best solutions will be developed when we bring these competencies together.”\nThe report is the outcome of a conference jointly organized by the IEC SyC on Smart Cities and the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Subcommittee on the Internet of Things and Digital Twin which took place on 22 - 23 June 2021.\nWatch the full interview with Chunlan Guo:"

        "content": "Over 230 participants joined the recent IEC webinar on IEC Strategic dialogue on the UN SDGs. The panel discussion brought together four business leaders to discuss their experiences in aligning their corporate strategies to the UN SDGs: Xavier Denoly, Senior Vice President Sustainable Development at Schneider Electric, Virginie Gatin, Executive VP Corporate Social Responsibility at Legrand, Barbara Guthrie, Vice President Corporate Sustainability at UL and Philippe Metzger, General Secretary and CEO at the IEC. \nTogether with the panel moderator Vimal Mahendru, IEC Ambassador for UN SDGs, they shared how and why companies are engaging with the UN SDGs and the role of standards and conformity assessment systems in helping to achieve these goals.\nSonya Bird, a member of the IEC Council Board Taskforce on the SDGs, opened the session by highlighting the IEC commitment to advancing the UN SDGs. “The IEC is a global, non-profit international organization whose work directly contributes to all 17 SDGs.”\nProviding a common framework\nAll panellists agreed that the UN SDGs provide a common framework and language. “The UN SDGs offer a benchmark to give us guidance to make the world a better place and leave the world a better place for the next generation,” noted Ms Guthrie. \nAccording to Mr Denoly, the UN SDGs offer aspirational goals for everyone. “Businesses cannot thrive unless people and the planet thrive together. It's good to have a common language to help us operate collaboratively. The SDGs give us the framework and overall direction.”\nFor Mr Metzger, there is a business case for sustainability. “In the context of the SDGs let's not stay on the surface but instead we must hone our existing DNA.” Ms Gatin agreed, noting that they offer a holistic approach and focus. “It is good to have all 17 goals to remind us of our priorities and it is helpful to dive deeper and have concrete targets too.”\nAdopting a successful strategy\nEach of the panellists gave their thoughts on how companies can incorporate sustainability into their strategy. “Make sure that your sustainability strategy is your company strategy, make it part of the core of your company. It's not easy, but be persistent and stay focused,” noted Mr Denoly.\nMs Guthrie agreed. “Choose goals that resonate with you and your stakeholders. Identify the strengths of your company, know what you are passionate about and focus on it.” For Ms Gatin, “Be ambitious in setting your targets. The targets should make you and your organization uncomfortable. It is necessary to engage with the value chain which is hard, complex and takes time but needs to be done to deliver successful value for your company.”\nHow the IEC can help\nStandards have a key role in helping to achieve sustainability targets. For Ms Gatin, sustainability should be considered at the same level as safety in product design. “We need to make the circular economy a genuine way of putting products on the market. This is where the IEC Standards can help.”\nAccording to Mr Denoly, “The IEC is a guardian of trust. The emergence of science-based solutions, such as those offered by the IEC, can serve to increase trust and confidence.” Ms Guthrie agreed. “Never underestimate the skills and expertise of the IEC. It is a convening, independent body which can engage dialogue.”\nAs Mr Metzger concluded, “We need to recognize the interdependencies and engage with the stakeholders around us. No single organization can do this all. We can leverage the technology and scientific know-how to create cases that prove we can benefit from sustainability.”\nThe recording of this webinar is now available online: www.iec.ch/academy/webinars"

Industry giants such as Siemens, Schneider Electric, Enedis as well as a host of smaller technology and renewable energy companies took part and many important keynotes were heard, together with a variety of high-level panel meetings.\nIEC Chair of Technical Committee 13 Peter Jensen made a presentation during the panel discussion Regulatory, Standards Landscape and Cost Benefits Analysis, where he evoqued the issue of interoperability for smart meters. He highlighted the fact that IEC TC 13 Standards play a key role in ensuring that interoperability. He stressed  that IEC Standards are produced thanks to the participation of multiple stakeholders, including, for smart meters, manufacturers, utilities and meter operators, IT companies or service providers. \"This consensus based-work helps to improve the quality and applicability of our standards,\" he explained.\n\nHe described how TC 13 was structured with different working groups dealing with diffferent aspects.Working Group 11, for instance, produces standards for electricity metering equipment including metrology, climatic, mechanical and electrical aspects, EMC and type testing. Working Group 14, on the other hand, produces the data exchange standards for meter reading, tariff and load control as well as communication protocoles and profiles."

        "content": "Electrical appliances with a permanently attached plug cannot be easily sold across markets or used in different countries because of incompatible wall sockets. Instead, appliances must be adapted to accommodate different plugs used around the world.\nDetachable appliance couplers are one way of countering this problem. An appliance coupler enables the connection and disconnection of an electric device to the power supply by providing the power supply connector (plug) on one end with a standardized connector to the appliance on the other. By detaching the country-specific power cord, it is possible for manufacturers to sell the same product in different countries by only replacing the power supply cord set.\nThe IEC has published a fourth edition of IEC 60320-1 which provides the general requirements for the safety and interchangeability of appliance couplers used for household and similar general purposes. According to Charles Kurten, Chair of the subcommittee which developed the standard (IEC SC 23G), “This new edition remains a cornerstone to interconnect electrical equipment using a common connection platform globally.”\nA commented version (CMV) of the official standard is available to allow for the easy identification of changes made compared to the previous edition (3.1). It also includes comments from the experts who developed the standard to explain the reasoning for the changes.\nUnderstanding the technical revisions\nCompared with the previous edition, the updated standard has introduced necessary tolerances and changes for better readability throughout the document. Tests such as those for glow wire, heating, lateral pull for connectors and plug connectors with separate front parts and ball pressure have been either added or revised. A new annex with additional tests and requirements for appliance couplers intended to be used in ambient temperatures above +35 °C has also been included.\nAs the Secretary of the subcommittee, Ingvar Eriksson notes, “This new edition will serve the growing market for appliance couplers used in higher ambient temperatures very well. We expect interest to be high for applications such as data centres.”\nThe first edition of IEC 60320-1 was published in 1970."

        "content": "IEC TC 23 prepares standards for electrical accessories. Nadine Bravais is one of the few women Chairs in the IEC and she has recently been renewed in her position at the head of TC 23. She replies to a few questions on existing and future challenges for the Technical Committee.\nHow would you explain the work of IEC TC 23 in just a few words? \nTC 23 plays a crucial role in ensuring safe interfaces between electrical installations and users whether the user is a human being or a machine. Human users range from skilled people to a non-specialized public, which includes vulnerable groups such as children or senior citizens. These different users are never far from our minds. To summarize, we prepare safety and performance standards for any electrical or electronic accessory, which is the interface between the electrical installation on the one side and the user or the machine on the other.\nHow important is energy efficiency as a standardization requirement inside TC 23?\nIt is one of the challenges we face. We are very aware of the role we can play in helping to reduce CO2 emissions and attempting to meet SDG 13. We created subcommittee SC 23K in 2016 to deal with energy efficiency systems and products, including customer energy manager systems or load and source switching equipment. Homes and buildings, which are becoming increasingly smart, will have to be sustainable, hyper efficient, resilient and digital. New standards are needed in this field. We realized we also needed a more global approach and that is why we set up Working Group 9 and published the first edition of IEC 63172 in 2020 to provide a methodology for determining the energy efficiency class of electrical accessories. \nDigitalization and automation are big trends – how do they affect your work?\nAutomation has long been a consideration in TC 23. More than 35 years ago, we published a standard on an automatic light switch which had additional properties for communication and control. It was a precursor to connected home and building systems. Around five years ago, we set up a working group to prepare standards for electronic systems used in homes and buildings. One of the issues is to ensure safety as the voltage levels between these systems and the mains are different. Our work enables home and building electronic systems (HBES) to form a robust basis to fully deliver their sustainable and digital promises. We are also investigating new developments such as global energy management systems (integrating renewables and microgrids), product data during the product/system's lifecycle and cyber security, where automation will play a crucial role.\nLooking ahead, what will be the main challenges in coming years?\nAs the requirement for sustainable solutions increases and the use of digital technology spreads, we must work differently and collaborate more with other TCs. We can’t find solutions to global issues and problems by working alone in a corner. That’s why the IEC Systems Committees can be of great help. Another challenge is to recruit people with new skills pertaining to the environment or digital technologies and enable them to understand electrical and electronic requirements, while also expanding the knowledge of electrotechnical experts in these new domains. \nRead more in e-tech"

        "content": "Lloyd’s Register (LR) has been accepted as the world’s first renewable energy Certification Body (RECB) for marine energy by IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications. The System covers the solar photovoltaic (PV), marine and wind energy sectors.\n“Marine Energy is the newest of our renewable energy technologies in IECRE and our members have worked exceptionally hard to develop a robust conformity assessment system to meet the needs of this exciting emerging sector. IECRE is delighted to welcome Lloyds Register as its first renewable energy certification body (RECB) for technology qualification (TQ).  As the sector develops IECRE is keen to offer new deliverables to help address the global climate challenge and the marine energy sector has an important role to play in maintaining a sustainable climate for future generations,” said Alistair Mackinnon, Chair of IECRE.\nIndependent assessment and certification supports marine energy technology\nMark Darley, LR Marine & Offshore Director, said: “Lloyd’s Register’s new status as the world's first IECRE Renewable Energy Certification Body for Marine Energy is a testament to our strong capabilities across a range of technical disciplines and our commitment to safety in the renewable energy market.  We look forward to working with new clients in the future, certifying marine energy or complex hybrid renewable energy projects in line with the IECRE scheme.”\n“Given the expected rapid growth of the marine energy industry, we anticipate the IECRE system will be widely adopted by the industry and become increasingly important in providing the assurance required by project stakeholders, which LR can provide, while ensuring this process adds value to projects,” Darley added.\nWith IECRE recognition as an RECB for both the marine energy and wind sector, LR is now able to certify complex hybrid renewable energy projects on behalf of the IECRE that involve multiple technologies, such as wind, wave and tidal.\nThrough its RECB status, LR can conduct end-to-end certification activities for marine energy converters that seek compliance with the IEC 62600 technical specification and operational documents published by the IECRE.\n“On behalf of the Marine Energy Sector Working Group (ME-SWG) of the IECRE, I extend my congratulations and excitement for Lloyds Register to join as the first IECRE Certification Body (RECB) within the ME Sector.  Certification plays a critical role in the development of the ME industry and the 3rd-party verification of compliance to international, consensus-based standards, such as the IEC TS 62600-4 on Technology Qualification, is essential to reduce risk and increase market confidence in the innovative technologies used to extract energy from waves, tides and other water currents,” said Jonathan Colby, Convener of the RE Management Committee, Marine Energy Sector Working Group.\nAbout Lloyds Register\nLloyd’s Register (LR) is a global professional services organization specializing in engineering and technology solutions. Its experts advise and support clients to improve the safety and performance of complex projects, supply chains and critical infrastructure. LR was created more than 260 years ago as the world’s first marine classification society to improve the safety of ships. Today it operates globally providing compliance, assurance and performance solutions to help keep the world moving safely, efficiently and sustainably.\nAbout IECRE\nIECRE is the global renewable energy conformity assessment system, which covers the solar PV, marine and wind energy sectors at a component, device or system type, and at the large utility project scale.

Many hoped that there would be a breakthrough in the battle against climate change, while others feared that leaders would fail to agree on concrete measures. In the end, there was progress on reducing fossil fuel emissions, although countries have deferred discussion of additional measures until the next round in 2022.\nThe almost 200 countries invited to next year’s COP 27 talks in Egypt are expected to submit updated plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. IEC Ambassador Vimal Mahendru, who attended COP 26, is optimistic that global leaders will step up their ambitions.\ne-tech spoke to Mr. Mahendru about his impressions of the conference and his experience representing the IEC in Glasgow.\ne-tech: How would you sum up your experience in Glasgow?\nVM:  There were several dimensions. There was a personal dimension — the dimension of a professional who is part of a delegation from India — and another dimension as an IEC ambassador, where my focus was the IEC. I was a fly on the wall, just trying to observe what's going on. \nI also felt that the discussions were perhaps on two levels. \nOne is the political dialogue between countries that happens behind closed doors. We only get to see the outcome. \nWe don't get to see how something has been argued and achieved. And there was a 10 000-strong community of people like me, who were engaging with each other and discussing, and they were very impactful. \nThey were sharing powerful stories. I'm sure that this information was getting through to the political leadership.\ne-tech: Looking ahead to COP 27, what can the IEC contribute to the success of the summit?\nVM: One of the challenges I heard very clearly is about how to ensure that everyone is adhering to the emissions goals? The world is crying out for a transparent system of ensuring everyone is conforming to their commitments. \nThis is where I see a huge opportunity for bringing about positive change through conformity assessment processes that are so very well polished at IEC. In many ways, I think that conformity assessment can play a huge role in validating a lot of what countries, regions, and companies are doing on the UN SDGs, not just on climate change.\n \n(This is an edited version of a longer article in IEC e-tech magazine.)\nWatch Vimal Mahendru’s COP 26 vlogs here."

        "content": "Cable cleats are used to fix, clamp and support electric cables to ensure safety. They can also provide protection by limiting cable movement during electrical fault conditions. \nThe new Commented Version of IEC 61914:2021 CMV, Cable cleats for electrical installations, specifies requirements and tests for cable cleats used for securing cables in electrical installations and for intermediate restraints used for holding cables together in formation in electrical installations.\n“Twenty years ago there were no standards for cable cleats,” says IEC TC 23/SC 23A/MT 16 convenor Steve Boyd. “Each manufacturer had their own way of testing and declaring the performance of their products.\n“The development of EN 50368 and its evolution into IEC 61914 under the guidance of Chris Calvert, my predecessor as convenor, has given a uniform set of type tests for manufacturers to declare the performance of their products.  It also enables specifiers and users to compare different products more easily and should enable them to readily select the most suitable cleat for their application.”\nThe commented version clearly identifies the differences between the previous version of the standard and the new edition, and also provides comments on each of the main technical changes. Some of those changes include the addition of:\n\nnew corrosion resistance classes for plated products\nnew requirements and tests for durability and legibility of markings\nnew test requirements for axial load testing of cleats for more than one cable\nlateral load test requirements for intermediate restraints\n\nCable cleats are used in low, medium and high voltage power cable systems and installed at intervals along circuits to secure electrical installations. Examples include:\n\nlow–computer networks, phones, lighting, alarm systems, security cameras and instrumentation\nmedium–substation equipment, for distribution of power in industrial settings and in mining to supply power to drills, shovels, hauliers\nhigh–power plants, power transmission, solar and wind industries.\n\nThey are deployed in diverse environmental conditions (onshore and offshore) and industrial applications. The primary aspect to consider when choosing a cable cleat is the outside cable diameter around the cable sheath. Where single-core cables that may be subjected to high fault currents are installed, the short circuit forces the cleat could be subjected to during fault conditions must be taken into account. Additional performance considerations may be corrosion and fire resistance.  \n“There has been an increase in the underground installation of sections of HV distribution grids in recent years,” observes Mr Boyd.  “This can result in the need for bespoke cleat designs for some of these projects.  \n“The extension of the short-circuit test to cover testing with higher voltage cables in the new edition of IEC 61914 should simplify the specification, testing and selection process of cable cleats for these installations”.\nIEC Technical Committee 23 develops standards for electrical accessories. IEC 61914 was published by Subcommittee 23A, for cable management systems, which covers products and systems used for the management of all types of cables, information and communication lines, electrical power distribution conductors and associated accessories."

As part of their mandate, IEC YP Leaders are asked to implement projects that can benefit the IEC community.\nAt the recent IEC YP workshop held alongside the IEC General Meeting, IEC YP Leaders from 2019, Baoying Tong and Shuo Wang, presented the outcomes of their projects that sought to strengthen and increase participation in the IEC YP Programme.\nPromoting cultural and geographical diversity\nParticipation by IEC YPs from Africa is low, representing 6% of all young professionals between 2017 -2019. According to Baoying, “This is a missed opportunity and leads to a biased discussion. The IEC YP Programme benefits when it can include the perspective from all parts of the world.”\nAs a result, Baoying sought to promote cultural and geographical diversity as well as strengthen YP ties with IEC National Committees in Africa, with a specific focus on Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, and Uganda. This has led to many meetings with IEC National Committees, as well as the update of the Guidelines for establishing National YP Programmes.\nThe results have been impressive. Relationships between the IEC YP programme and IEC NCs from Africa have been strengthened, resulting in a mentoring agreement between South Africa and Uganda and collaboration sharing between Australia and Cote d’Ivoire, and Kenya with Ghana. In addition, 14 African YPs from seven countries representing 13% of the 2021 nominations attended the recent YP workshop.\nAs Baoying notes, “We are really excited that we can bring new perspectives into the YP programme. The YP programme is strengthened when it can include voices from around the world.”\nImportance of national YP programmes\nShuo Wang undertook a project to improve the participation of young professionals from the Asian Pacific region through national YP programmes. According to Shuo, the project sought to “share best practices between national YP programmes, enhance the communications among young professionals in the region and to organize regional events.”\nThe project brought together a team of 14 representing Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea Rep., Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore. As a first step, the team put together a survey to better understand the ideas of the YP activities in the region to find a better way in which cooperation could be possible. Nine IEC National Committees responded with ideas that included joint training sessions, knowledge and experience sharing and open collaboration sessions. \nAs a result, the team organized a webinar together with the IEC Academy in May 2021 on the topic of best practices to enable young professionals in the Asia Pacific region. As Shuo noted, the webinar allowed participants to “learn more about how NCs attract YPs and encourage them to stay active whether at the national or international level. We were really excited by the number of participants which included NC Secretaries and officer as well as IEC YPs and their enthusiasm.”\nThe presentations and videos from the webinar are available on the IEC Academy webpage."

        "content": "The webinar entitled Energy efficiency standards for improving and optimizing the energy consumption of electric driven machine units took place on 22 November and highlighted the work done in the IEC and ISO Joint Advisory Group 22 (JAG 22), which seeks to align system standards for electric motor systems.\nThree different speakers made presentations, starting with Philippe Vollet, the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) who presented the different guides for energy efficiency published by the Committee, for instance IEC Guide 118: Inclusion of energy efficiency aspects in electrotechnical publications. The document gives guidance on how to consider EE aspects when preparing IEC standards. EE consists of using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for a better performance, or improving the conversion of primary energy into electricity.\nThe second speaker, Maarten Van Werkhoven, an energy efficiency specialist and member of ACEE, as well as of the new JAG 22, highlighted the fact that electric motors and motor systems used in industrial settings and buildings are responsible for 53% of the world’s total electricity consumption. This includes pumps and fans whether for cooling or heating and many other motor-driven systems. He reminded attendees that the IEC prepared standards dealing with the power supply aspects and the electric motors while ISO published standards to do with the products driven by the power, whether the fan or the pump or the compressor. \nTo be energy efficient, the whole systems from power supply to end-product must be considered in a global fashion. Hence the need for IEC and ISO to work together, which was not necessarily the case a few years ago. In October 2021, JAG 22 was set up following in the foosteps of the CAISEMS project estsblished in 2019. The JAG includes IEC TC 2 which prepares standards for rotating machinery (motors), IEC TC 22 /Subcommittee 22G, which publishes documents relating to converters and ISO TC 117 which prepares standards for fans. One of the benefits, according to Van Werkhoven, is to exchange information, avoid the duplication of standards and to get them to be truly interoperable. \nConrad Brunner is also a member of ACEE and of JAG 22 as well as of ISO TC 117 and ISO TC 115: Pumps, which is also invited to take part in the JAG, alongside ISO TC 118: Compressors. He highlighted the main issues required to improve energy efficiency, including the downsizing of machinery (as most machines are oversized) and the need to use them only when necessary (not at night-time and weekends, for instance). He explained that if the electrotechnical side managed by IEC Standards and the mechanical by ISO documents did not interoperate properly, the systems would never be energy efficient. The essential work inside JAG 22 focuses notably on preparing a second edition of IEC TS 60034-31 with a new energy efficiency interpolation method. \nFor more information: IEC Academy."

        "content": "IEC General Secretary and CEO Philippe Metzger has spoken at the OVE Innovation Day held in Vienna on how the IEC is adapting to the requirements of an all-digital future. OVE, the Austrian Association for Electrical Engineering, is a member of the IEC. \nFollowing are selected highlights of Mr Metzger's speech. \nSafeguarding IEC core principles\n\"As we move towards a more digital era, we need to ask ourselves how an institution as venerable as the IEC, established in 1906, can adapt to digital imperatives? However, in doing so, we must also not overlook the principles at the core of the IEC: consensus, transparency, and diversity.\n\"Not losing our compass is essential here. The IEC brings together a global network of stakeholders to develop technical solutions and best practices that connect global economies, ensure the safety and well-being of citizens, and guarantee the performance and reliability of technology.\n\"IEC Standards are the culmination of a consensus-driven process based on clearly defined, transparent rules. Combining international standards with conformity assessment provides the confidence that products respect globally recognized standards for safety and performance\".\nSeizing the opportunities of digitalization\n\"Looking to the future, how can we ensure that the IEC not only maintains its relevance but, even more so, reaps the benefits of the many opportunities that are emerging as we transition towards an all-electric economy and society and an all-digital future?\n\"In order to streamline the process for drafting and editing standards, we are currently implementing a project, together with ISO, that allows standards developers to work efficiently and collaboratively in a truly digital environment. This “Online Standards Development” (OSD) platform not only makes the process of drafting standards more agile and efficient, but it also provides the foundations for creating innovative products and services for standards users.\n\"Our conformity assessment systems are also strengthening their digital infrastructure with activities underway to automate and digitize current processes. And, despite restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic that limited travel and face-to-face meetings, we were able to quickly introduce new procedures for remote peer assessments demonstrating true agility in addressing unexpected challenges\".\nLooking towards a digital future\n\"The IEC is already developing standards and conformity assessment solutions for the digital economy that retain our hallmarks for safety and security.\n\"We are now aiming to deploy so-called SMART standards that will not only be machine-readable, but also machine-interpretable, machine-executable, and machine-updatable, offering users Standards as a Service (SaaS).\n\"Digital transformation is much more than just offering new digital services. Rather, it is about re-imagining IEC Standards to deliver greater value to all of our stakeholders and offering the best possible solutions that are aligned with our core values\".\nAddressing the needs of society\n\"Technical standards cannot be developed in a vacuum but must also consider potential societal repercussions that new technologies may generate. While it is not the role of the IEC to make ethical judgements about the use of particular technologies, we can offer policymakers, regulators, researchers, and other relevant stakeholders methodologies and a platform to strengthen the dialogue between all parties so as to ensure that we are fully cognizant of their potential impact.\n\"International standards are developed by a broad and diverse range of stakeholders to ensure that society benefits from advances in new technologies while mitigating possible adverse effects.\n\"The future of the IEC is at the nexus between the needs of society and the economy. As the IEC embraces digital transformation, we will continue to live and breathe our core values and principles – consensus, transparency, and diversity. This collaborative approach enables best-in-class solutions that can foster technical excellence while tackling social and ethical challenges ahead\".\nRead more about the event on the OVE website (in German)"

The report, titled 'Quantum Information Technologies', addresses standardization readiness, as well as the challenges for effective standardization.\nThe white paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) and is available as a free download. The IEC Blog spoke to one of the report's authors, Dr. Taikmin Lee of the Korean Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM). \nIEC Blog: Who is the IEC White Paper intended for?\nTL: Our intention was not only to produce a paper for the experts but for all people who have an interest in quantum information technology (QIT). \nBy the way, quantum tech is quite difficult even for people with backgrounds in science and engineering. It will definitely be more readable for people who have some background knowledge.\nIEC Blog: Why are quantum technologies important? \nTL: Quantum computers are expected to be significantly faster than conventional computers. They will, for example, speed up artificial intelligence technologies like machine learning that currently take time.\n\nAlso, it can reduce the time for codebreaking (cryptography). This influence will be enormous.\nVice versa, quantum communication is very suitable for encryption. If someone tries to hack into a network, quantum communication can block it.\nQuantum sensing has applications in a wide variety of fields, including quantum-based clocks, magnetic-field sensors, high-energy physics, inertial sensors, single photonic elements, and quantum imaging.\nIEC Blog: How ripe are these technologies for standardization?\nTL: Standardization activity has already started in the field of protocols for quantum communication. As far as I remember, there are already 10 standardization projects underway. \nAlso, there are many products - parts, submodules and systems for quantum communication and quantum sensors. We can already buy these on the market.\nBut I don’t think that quantum computing is ready for standardization. Although some work has begun on quantum computing in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO, it is very early days and the focus is on things like terminology.\n\nIEC Blog: Why is it important to standardize terminology?\nTL: Terminology is always important for every field of science and engineering. It is regarded as the basis of standardization. \nWhen we agree on the terminology, it is easier to exchange information and to share best practices.\nIEC Blog: Going back to cryptography and data security, how likely are we to see standards for things like quantum random number generators?\n\nTL: How to measure the performance of quantum random number generators can be standardized. There are also parts, submodules, and systems that consist of quantum random number generators.\nI believe that the performance of these can be standardized. Without standardization, we have to keep our fingers crossed when we buy them as we lack evidence that they work.\n\n \nResources\nIEC White Paper on Quantum Information Technology\nHow quantum computers work"

        "content": "From finance, healthcare and retail to manufacturing, tourism and smart city infrastructure, opportunities and use cases for artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing. \nThe international standards being developed by the IEC and ISO joint committee (SC 42) address the ever-evolving requirements and challenges of these technologies across diverse industries and applications. SC 42 draws on the expertise of a very broad and diverse set of stakeholders as well as IEC and ISO domain experts through strong collaboration.\nAgainst this backdrop, SC 42 concluded its recent plenary, with over 260 participants from 50 countries. \n“The technological advances in AI continue to fuel the digital transformation enabling new applications and their benefits that a mere few years ago would not have been possible. SC 42 is uniquely positioned to address these emerging areas by collaborating with the diverse portfolio of committees in IEC and ISO that cover many of these domains.\nMoreover, our unique holistic approach to looking at the entire AI ecosystem has enabled us to dynamically react to emerging AI requirements and expand the work programme accordingly. The participating members and diversity of stakeholders and growth in our work programme continues to be strong despite the pandemic”, said Wael William Diab, Chair of SC 42.\nNew work\nAs the work programme continues to evolve, new projects are expected across the board in the areas of AI data, trustworthiness, computational, and ethics.  \nReflecting the growing AI applications and strong interest in the work of SC 42, the committee approved a revision of the recently published ISO/IEC 24030:2021 on AI use cases. The work has already begun and it is anticipated that more use cases coming from the growing portfolio of liaison partners will be submitted. \nRecognizing the fast pace of technological innovation in this area and to assist in dynamically reacting to emerging standardization needs across the AI ecosystem, a new advisory group was setup to make recommendations to SC 42 on AI standardization roadmapping. This group will complement the existing roadmapping being done in the established areas under SC 42.\nWith over 45 liaison relationships that include committees within IEC and ISO as well as external organizations, the growth in the portfolio reflects the importance of collaboration in this area and the value of horizontal standards that SC 42 is developing. It recently approved the establishment of a new liaison with the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE).\nISO/IEC AI workshop series \nStarting next year, SC 42 expects to launch an ISO/IEC AI workshop which will be run bi-annually. \nThe workshops will focus on the standards and the broader non standards community interested in AI. The workshop goals are to promote and inform on the committee’s work as well as identify emerging trends, requirements, insights and opportunities that may help next generation of SC 42 work, attract new stakeholders and provide a platform for discussion."

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the surge of disinformation online, which is undermining trust in science and media. Compounding the issue is the easy availability of sophisticated software for editing photos and videos.\nThe sheer volume of manipulated media, ranging from doctored images to deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence, is making it increasingly difficult for consumers to trust what they see online. It is also making it harder for journalists, as well as others whose job it is to separate falsehoods from what is real, to verify content and sources. \nA 90-minute IEC webinar on 19 November will provide an overview of best practices currently employed in cutting-edge newsrooms and will look at powerful new verification tools being developed by the scientists and technology experts responsible for the JPEG picture format. It will bring together two distinguished experts — from the worlds of public service journalism and media technology — to explore these trends in more detail. \nMichael Wegener is a senior editor with the German radio and television broadcaster, ARD, and a member of the European Broadcasting Union’s (EBU) News Committee. He will describe the verification processes and tools currently used by public service broadcasters across Europe and beyond.  \nTouradj Ebrahimi is a professor at the EPFL in Lausanne and convenor of the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) that develops the world’s best-known picture format. JPEG is part of the joint technical committee (JTC 1) set up by the world’s leading standards organizations, IEC and ISO. \nProfessor Ebrahimi will discuss plans to develop a new international, consensus-based standard that will make it easier to verify the authenticity of photos and video. JPEG hopes that the new standard will result in media that protects source information and safeguards intellectual property rights. \nThe aim is simply to provide more transparency because not all fake media is necessarily malicious in purpose. Special effects in movies, photographers creating several versions of an image for different purposes, or radio journalists removing ums and pauses from interviews are all examples of media manipulated for good reasons.\nAmong others, the new standard will help journalists and insurance investigators, as well as artists who have seen their original digital works minted as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) by scammers. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought and sold like physical property, with some fetching tens of millions of dollars at auction.\n‘Combatting fake media — can international standards help?’ is on 19 November at 12:00 (CET).

        "content": "IEC Technical Committees (TCs) are looking at ways to attract the younger generation to participate in standardization. That is why they have been presenting their work to IEC Young Professionals taking part in the annual workshop, which is held during the IEC General Meeting.\nThe objective is to prepare the interested YPs for future careers and professional development in standardization. The conversations, however, are not only in one direction as TCs are keen to hear ideas from YPs for shaping the future direction of standardization work. \nA consistent challenge faced by many technical committees is how to take up opportunities and effectively engage the future leaders? In the recent 2021 IEC YP Workshop, IEC TC 106, in charge of methods for the assessment of electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields associated with human exposure, tested a new hybrid workshop model which received overwhelmingly positive feedback from YPs. Here is how we did it.\nThe 'Exploring how 5G can empower the future and make a difference' workshop was organized as an interactive session for more than 109 YPs from 46 countries, 69 participating online and 40 in person. To enhance the experience, the organizers planned the 90-minute session with presentations, break-out room discussions, panel sessions and real-life demonstrations.\nStarting with a brief introduction, it led to a 10-minute presentation by Mike Wood, chair of IEC TC 106, who unveiled some of the most exciting, cutting-edge 5G applications to set the scene for break-out rooms. YPs divided into five breakout groups, then discussed the following questions with their peers relating to their work and life in an era of 5G:\n\nhow can 5G transform your life in cities and regional areas?\nhow can 5G make a difference to your industry?\n\nDuring their discussions, experts from TC 106 visited each breakout room and had robust conversations with the groups. When the discussions ended, each group elected a leader to represent them.\nThe group leaders were then invited to the virtual stage with TC 106 experts to share discussion outcomes and test ideas in the panel discussion. \nAll of the sections paved the way for the live demo, when a group of YPs from the leading Australian telecom company Telstra turned on the camera and showcased the latest development of 5G technology from Telstra lab on the Gold Coast, in Australia.\nBesides demonstrating real-life testing of the latest 5G millimetre wave technology, the Telstra YPs also explained fascinating 5G-enabled applications such as flying cars. The session ended with the message that now is the time for anyone interested in 5G to try out their ideas and learn from practice.\nCurious, passionate, and filled with a willingness to push for change, YPs will shape the future of technology standardization and IEC. For established TCs, it remains a priority to engage the emerging leaders and enable them to lead in the future.\nThat is why we are encouraging TCs to consider this model of delivery for future webinars aimed at engaging YPs for interactive, exploratory, and robust conversations.

        "abstract": "The increasing use of renewable energies is an important way to reduce Co2 emissions. The growing reliance on these energies can increase the strain on the electricity grid. A new standard helps.",
        "content": "Conventional power grids, which used to deliver electricity in a one-way direction to different consumers, increasingly must integrate resources which generate power locally, such as solar panels on the roof of a house, for example. Electricity networks must manage energy storage to optimize the use of intermittent energy produced by renewable energies. This means storing energy when excess renewable energy is produced, and generate  more energy when power is lacking. The grid must be able to safely and efficiently control such bi-directional power-flows relating to distributed energy resources (DERs).\nNew smart grid technologies are helping to ensure that the grid is appropriately balanced between supply and demand and therefore  keeps stable. DERs often combine renewable energy installations such as rooftop solar modules, small wind turbines or small hydro with a set of batteries to form a microgrid or a minigrid. Microgrids are used by small residential or commercial consumers. Minigrids are larger configurations, which can power large commercial outlets, universities, factories, cities and even islands.\n The IEC 61850 standards are a foundational series of publications which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They deal with issues such as the integration of renewable energies and DERs within the electrical network. IEC Technical Committee 57 recently published a new edition of IEC 61850-7-420 which standardizes DER communication interfaces , in order to reach semantic interoperability between these DERs and DER management systems and more generally grid management systems.\nThe new publication proposes a generic approach of data modelling to support data exchange for any kind of DER, including generation, storage and controllable loads. It also proposes a generic approach to support the physical and virtual aggregation of DERs.\nDERS, such as renewable energy systems, can also help the grid better withstand extreme weather episodes, one of the effects of climate change.

        "content": "Geneva, 2 November 2021-The world’s leading developers of International Standards – IEC, ISO and ITU – have signalled their strong interest in working with the United Nations to combat climate change. They were responding to a decision by António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, to establish a group of experts to “propose clear standards to measure and analyse net-zero commitments from non-state actors”.\nThe three standards organizations applauded Mr Guterres for recognizing the importance of standards in his opening address to COP26 and said they would be delighted to collaborate on any such initiative to share existing standards already widely used and assist in developing future ones to meet world needs.\n“In support of the realization of an ‘All Electric Society’, we offer a widely recognized neutral, independent, consensus-based institutional framework that helps to build net-zero commitments into systems and infrastructure for concrete contributions to climate change mitigation,” explained Philippe Metzger, IEC General Secretary and CEO.\n“The world needs to collaborate now, more than ever, to reach net-zero commitments. ISO standards represent such collaboration and are vital to a sustainable future,” said Sergio Mujica, ISO Secretary-General.\n“ITU is ready to join the global alliance for climate actions with standards and development programmes, sharing the COP26 conviction that we need to build solidarity towards achieving global net-zero emissions,” said Chaesub Lee, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau.\n\n\nIEC, ISO and ITU have hundreds of internationally agreed standards dedicated to achieving net-zero commitments, including those that measure carbon emissions, define climate change mitigation, frame the use of carbon-free technologies and the corresponding adaptation measures. Many are the international reference used in sustainability policymaking.\nISO’s commitment to the net-zero goals was reinforced with the recent London Declaration. The declaration pledges to ensure standards help to accelerate the successful achievement of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Call for Action on Adaptation and Resilience. The IEC supports the objectives of this declaration.\nThe London Declaration is complemented by the ISO and IEC “Climate Action Kit”, a package to support policymakers in their commitment to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. The package presents case studies on how standards can support public policies and influence climate change initiatives.\nThe broad range of ITU standards linking information and communication technology (ICT) with the global drive towards net-zero emissions include technical and policy guidance for cities and countries innovating with digital technologies to reduce emissions and accelerate adaptation actions and resilience, methodologies to measure the growing carbon footprint of the ICT sector, and the first ICT sector science-based pathway in line with the Paris Agreement.\nITU’s Connect 2030 Agenda for Global Telecommunication/ICT Development also calls for a 30 per cent increase in net telecommunication/ICT-enabled greenhouse gas abatement by 2023 compared to the 2015 baseline, a resolution which 193 Member States have adopted.\nIEC, ISO and ITU will continue reinforcing their work together to achieve net-zero emissions, leveraging collaborative platforms such as the IEC-ISO-ITU Joint Task Force on standards for smart cities. \n\n \nRelated content\nProtecting the environment"

        "content": "An exhibit from Ghana at the London Design Museum goes to the heart of the problem of e-waste. The installation by Ibrahim Mahama is part of a new exhibition called Waste Age, which is opening to coincide with the COP26 climate summit. \n“'We must face the problem of waste – we can no longer ignore what happens to things when we get rid of them,” says the exhibition curator, Gemma Curtin.\nMahama’s installation features a wall of old television sets that play clips from one of the world’s largest e-waste sites. It is believed that millions of tons of e-waste are processed each year in the Agbogbloshie site, in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.\nWorkers set fire to the waste and are often joined by school-age children to harvest copper and other precious metals from the burnt cables. The high levels of lead in the soil and toxic chemicals in the water pose major health risks to the local community.\nIt is clear that urgent action is needed to stop the damage bring wrought by Agbogbloshie and other e-waste sites in the developing world. But the huge quantities of e-waste being generated are a problem for the entire planet. \nAccording to the Global E-waste Monitor, 53,6 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste was generated in 2019. At current rates, a projected 74,7 million tonnes of e-waste will be reached by 2030.\n“E-waste is a global topic affecting not only the countries using the electrical and electronic equipment that generates the waste but also, and very importantly, those countries that collect e-waste for end-of-life treatment,” says Christophe Garnier who leads the development of horizontal environmental standards for electrical and electronic products at the IEC.\nMany countries have placed obligations on manufacturers to ensure that their products are properly recycled and disposed of once they reach the end of their usefulness. With extended producer responsibilities, manufacturers are responsible for the product throughout its lifecycle, including product take-back, recycling and final disposal.\nIn many parts of the world, however, extended producer responsibility is not obligatory. According to Christian Dworak, who chairs the IEC working group on e-waste, current studies estimate that only a third of e-waste is handled by official channels and properly tracked and disposed of.\n“The remaining two-thirds is disappearing. While it is assumed that some of this waste may be reused or recycled, it is not clear how much,” he notes.\nA worldwide approach to reduce e-waste\nEarlier this year, the IEC agreed to move forward with a new project that addresses e-waste. The proposed horizontal standard aims to facilitate the systematic, sustainable management of e-waste. Among its objectives, it seeks to reduce the amount of e-waste sent for disposal through reuse and recovery, prevent the inappropriate disposal of e-waste and restrict operators who do not comply with the standard or comparable requirements from receiving e-waste shipments.\n“Because e-waste does not stop at national or regional borders, there is a need for an international approach to the treatment and the preparation for the reuse of e-waste,” says Mr Dworak."

        "content": "Cities are increasingly suffering from the consequences of climate or weather-related disasters. Given that 40% of cities are developing in areas at risk of floods, hurricanes, seismic activity and heat waves, they will face the brunt of such disasters.\nFor World Cities Day this year, the United Nations is bringing attention to impact of climate change on cities with its theme Adapting Cities for Climate Resilience. Finding ways to reduce risk and enhance resilience is becoming a top priority as the number of climate-related disasters continues to increase.\nRole of standards\nIEC Standards help cities ensure that critical infrastructure, such as transport networks and electricity grids, function properly and safely. More than 2 000 IEC publications directly impact safe and sustainable urbanization.\nUnderstanding the system complexity of cities is one of the most important steps towards building resiliency. The IEC has adopted a system approach to smart city standardization through SyC Smart cities in recognition that cities are made up of individual though interconnected systems - such as water, energy, transport, etc- that must be addressed holistically.\nBuilding resilience\nTo ensure resilience requires putting in place plans to anticipate the potential impact of a disaster, taking steps to mitigate or prevent disasters and, finally, to absorb and manage the disaster once it has occurred.\nAccording to a report by the World Bank, USD 4,2 trillion can be saved by investing in more resilient infrastructure. Making infrastructure more resilient not only helps to avoid costly repairs but also minimizes the consequences of disasters. It has recently developed a methodology to build and track resilience to climate change.\nIEC work helps strengthen disaster resilience of infrastructure through built-in safety mechanisms, processes and minimum requirements. IEC Standards include external environmental conditions in their design requirements.\nEnsuring service continuity\nCity services cannot operate without electricity. In 2020, the IEC published IEC 63152 to provide city planners with guidelines to sustain a variety of city services following a disruption. It outlines the basic concepts of how multiple city services can cooperate to maintain the supply of electricity.\nCurrently, SyC Smart cities is preparing a new publication that will provide practical details for the implementation of IEC 63152. It helps define what should be considered when designing guidelines for city service continuity, including templates and use cases to ensure that service providers consider requirements for a wide range of situations, such as the need for multiple disaster response.\nLeveraging smart cities\nSmart cities make use of data and technology to offer improvements to city life, city services and resilience. By collecting data easily and using algorithms to analyze the data in real time, it is possible to formulate an overall picture of what is going on in a given area – and how it can be improved or strengthened. Often, infrastructure has to be continuously managed and monitored for operational and maintenance purposes to ensure it serves its designed purpose and works safely. IEC SyC Smart cities is currently working on a new project to develop a smart cities reference architecture (SCRA) which will incorporate resilience by design. It addresses stakeholder requirements and their interdependence to ensure that resilience is maintained in all aspects of the city.\nMonitoring as well as providing early warning systems to enable residents to find safety can help reduce the cost of a disaster. According to a recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), improved early warnings and disaster management have decreased the number of deaths by nearly three-fold over a 50-year period. While the number of natural disasters may be on the rise, resilience and preparation planning based on best practices are essential to ensure that cities can cope with the climate challenges of the future. Management of critical assets for resilience in smart cities will not only require smart technology but also smart partnerships amongst communities and cities in various regions."

        "content": "The French physicist, Jacques Curie, born on 29 October 1855, is remembered today for his discovery of piezoelectricity. Curie and his younger brother, Pierre, first demonstrated the piezoelectric effect in 1880, but more than a century passed before it began to have any practical applications.\nPiezoelectricity is the electric charge produced by certain crystals when a mechanical stress is applied. At the IEC, standards for piezoelectric technology are developed by IEC TC 49, which addresses piezoelectric, dielectric and electrostatic devices.\nPiezoelectric crystals can also be embedded beneath a layer of asphalt. As cars drive over the road, the wheels exert a force that causes these crystals to deform and generate electrical energy. \nThis energy can then be used to power streetlights or can be stored in batteries for later use. The IEC 62830-1 series, prepared by IEC TC 47, includes methods for evaluating the performance of vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvesting devices.\nThe piezoelectric effect has been exploited in many ways, ranging from piezoelectric inkjet printing to bone fracture healing. Cigarette lighters and gas cookers use the piezoelectric effect to generate sparks. \nIt is also behind technologies designed to harvest energy from roads by capturing ambient energy and converting it to electric power. This electricity can then be used to power road infrastructure such as lights and signals. \nIt can be stored in batteries for use when needed or fed into the electric power grid. And, because it makes use of the existing road network, no new land space needs to be allocated.\nEnergy harvesting solutions making use of roads are still in their early stages. Because much of the current research and development has been undertaken by private companies, there is limited public availability of data. \nCosts remain high given the lack of mass production but some of these solutions may yet gain traction. \nAdditional technologies such as sensors and microprocessors could be incorporated that monitor infrastructure and vehicular traffic conditions in real-time. Such solutions will rely upon standards developed by the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee, JTC 1/SC 25 for microprocessor systems and IEC TC 47 for sensors. \nIt is not yet clear which technologies, if any, will be implemented. But the enthusiasm remains in the pursuit of renewable energies.\nJacques Curie’s brother, Pierre, went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radiation. Jacques Curie was appointed professor of mineralogy at the University of Montpellier, where he remained until his death in 1941"

        "content": "In 2021 it seems hard to fathom travelling without modern communication, but that was the case for many on the Titanic. \nIrish-Italian wireless pioneer Guglielmo Marconi sold his systems to most passenger ships operating in the north Atlantic, including the Titanic. Only first-class passengers could afford to pass messages to shore via morse code thanks to the state-of-the-art wireless equipment onboard. Wireless operators communicated with nearby ships and relayed passengers’ personal messages on the same open channels. \nUnfortunately, there was no established practice to keep a clear channel for emergency communications. Passenger messages jammed the channels at a crucial point and several ice warnings from other vessels were missed or ignored. \nValuable lessons\nThe rest is history. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) resulted from the 1912 Titanic disaster. In 1914 SOLAS introduced the carriage of radiotelegraphy installations on passenger ships. This was extended over the years to different sized cargo ships and finally in 1974, all ships had to carry VHF radiotelephony. \nOver the years, as instruments evolved from electromechanical to electronic and different organizations, including IMO, IEC and ISO committees worked of different aspects of maritime navigation equipment and systems, it was recognized that there was an urgent need to create a group that could facilitate cooperation with the different stakeholders. \nCovering a global maritime ecosystem\nIn 1980, IEC Technical Committee 80 was created to develop international standards which address the operational and performance requirements and test methods for maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems. \nThe standards aim is to enable vessels to navigate efficiently among themselves and in ways that protect the environment and the safety of life at sea in international waters.\nThe committee has representatives from governments, industry, users and test certification bodies working on:\n\nDigital interfaces for navigational equipment within a ship\nAutomatic identification system \nBridge alert management \nCommon Maritime Data Structure \n\nA rich history\nOver the last 41 years, it has developed 45 standards which mirror the performance standards adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) recommendations and standards developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). \nFind out more about the history in 1980-2020 The First Forty Years, compiled by the current IEC TC 80 Secretary, Mr Kim Fisher. During the committee's 40th anniversary in 2020, Hannu Peiponen, Chair of IEC TC 80 commented:\n\"On this 40th anniversary, I would like to express my appreciation of Kim Fisher and his considerable role in TC 80. I have held the chair position for six years and have three left of my term. Kim has been the committee secretary for many years. As chair, I have been able to follow the secretary’s role closely. Kim has a very broad understanding of the technology within the scope of the TC 80 and also knows the standards’ content well. In particular, he knows the details of radiocommunication, as he was part of the UK administration when the Global Maritime Distress and Safety Systems (GMDSS) was agreed at the IMO.\"\nKey standards \nAdvances in equipment and technology have resulted in a work programme covering many areas including: radar, track control, automatic radar plotting aid, devices to measure speed and distance, terrestrial radionavigation systems, global navigation satellite systems, digital interfaces, electronic chart and information system, global maritime distress and safety system, integrated bridge system, integrated navigation system, voyage data recorder, display and navigational related information and more.\nSome of the key standards developed include:\nIEC 60945, Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems - General requirements - Methods of testing and required test results.\nThis standard can be applied to shipborne radio equipment, shipborne navigational equipment, and, for EMC only, all other bridge-mounted equipment, equipment in close proximity to receiving antennas, as well as equipment capable of interfering with safe navigation of the ship and with radiocommunications. This standard was accepted by IMO and is referenced in IMO performance standards.\nIEC 61162, Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems - Digital interfaces.\nThe series of standards considers different digital interfaces to enable communication between navigational and communication equipment. For instance, IEC 61162-450 considers Ethernet interconnection and the -460 covers the safety and security of networks. \nIEC 62288 specifies the general requirements, methods of testing, and required test results, for the presentation of navigation-related information on shipborne navigational displays in support of three IMO resolutions."

Around 150 experts presented and discussed the latest topics relating to the use of the IEC 61850 Standards in the roll-out of digital substations and the connection of the grid with distributed energy systems (DERs).\nSeveral IEC experts explained the latest work inside Technical Committee 57, which publishes the standards. They included Christoph Brunner, who focused on interoperability aspects and how the standards allow for both backward compatibility with previous documents, in some specific cases, and forward compatibility with what will be published.\nHe outlined the aspects covered in IEC 61850-7-1, 61850-7-2, 61850-7-3 and 61850-7-4 and their most recent amendments. He also presented the work of IEC 61850-7- 420, a new edition of which was published in 2021. The standard produces a generic model for integrating DERs into the grid. \nOne of the key topics was the roll-out of digital and automatized substations, with several utilities reporting on their achievements. Iceland’s Birkir Heimisson, an expert at Landsnet, which operates more than 3,000 km of transmission lines and about 70 substations and transformer stations, presented the company’s decision to go digital in 2019, using the IEC 61850 Standards.\nIt initially commissioned six digital substations, which were successfully rolled out. According to Heimisson, if mistakes were made, they led to finding new solutions at each time. Challenges included the lack of knowledge and experience at the beginning which improved as the project rolled out and a lack of clarity in some requirements.\nDigital twins were also a hot topic with an original presentation, featuring his own digital twin, from Andrea Bonetti, from Megger, which supplies test solutions for the grid. As many, he pointed out how the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated digital transformation of the grid and how virtual work,  especially for relay testing, is becoming a must.\nHe explained that a virtual representation serves as a real-time digital object which has many advantages including the possibility of enabling the testing to take place anywhere and anytime, and with no geographical barriers. It is a very good tool to use for training new staff, as it is safe by essence. While it won’t totally replace on-site testing, it can significantly reduce physical testing, enabling utilities to reduce costs."

Its unique holistic approach considers the entire AI ecosystem, by looking at technology capability and non-technical requirements, such as business and regulatory and policy requirements, application domain needs, and ethical and societal concerns.\nOver 260 participants from committee’s 50 member countries from around the world joined the SC 42 plenary which began on 18 October and opened with keynote presentations from several distinguished guest speakers.\nCollaboration for new AI regulation\nStefano Nativi, Big Data Lead Scientist of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, presented the EC’s AI Watch Study – AI standards to support the European AI Act implementation. Nativi noted that a core group of six IEC/ISO standards have emerged as the most relevant working items to focus on for implementing the AI Act, while addressing different stakeholder concerns. One of the key recommendations was to start collaborating with standardization development organizations (SDOs), to improve suitability of standards and address identified gaps.\n“To support the operationalization of legal acts dealing with digital technologies, there exists the need to introduce an effective, repeatable, and transparent methodology to monitor standardization development in wide domains, such as AI, and recognize possible gaps”, said Nativi.\nSalvatore Scalzo, Policy and Legal Officer in the field of Artificial Intelligence at European Commission - DG CNECT, discussed the development of the EC AI Act, which sets out horizontal rules for the development, commodification and use of AI-driven products, services and systems within the EU and provides core artificial intelligence rules that apply to all industries. Scalzo explained that the Act takes a risk-based approach addressing the health, safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses using such products, as well as considering public interest.\n“Standards are expected to play a key role in the implementation of the new rules. The Commission is thus keen to engage actively with the standardization community in the field to ensure that future standards on AI will adequately fulfil market and regulatory expectations”, said Scalzo.\nDigital transformation at IEC\nRalph Sporer, Chair of the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB), presented on the IEC digital transformation strategy. He highlighted the SMART Standards concept, which aims to connect initiatives, provide the means for a common interpretation of digital standards between and across domains, increase understanding of what is meant by machine readable, and develop a way for standards development organizations to successfully evolve while considering technological, legal and business constraints.\n“AI standards will support the digital transformation strategy. IEC has a unique opportunity for collaboration between horizontal IT standards like those developed by SC 42 and the application domains of IEC”, said Sporer.\nAI standards work programme\nAs discussed by the keynote speakers, AI remains a key technology for enabling the digital transformation. Moreover, the context of use of the SC 42 technologies are key to the broad and successful adoption while simultaneously addressing emerging non-technical challenges from their anticipated ubiquitous use.\n\n“Our work programme reflects this reality and our approach of looking at the ecosystem continues to be of great interest across verticals and disciplines. This coming year, key initiatives will be to continue identifying gaps in the programme of work, continuing to partner with application committees to leverage the SC 42 work in their application domains and carry on our outreach to ensure that we have a diverse set of stakeholders and disciplines in the development of our work”, said Wael William Diab, Chair of SC 42.\nDiab recognized the SC 42 leadership team and Committee Manager’s preparation efforts for the plenary and thanked the guest speakers. He acknowledged the ISO and IEC communications teams who continue to promote SC 42 work, the ISO Technical Programme Manager for SC 42, the IEC JTC 1 Technical Officer and the JTC 1 leadership, who have made themselves readily available when required. He also thanked the Systems Integration Facilitation Convenor and team who have participated in all plenaries to date.\nFind out more about SC 42 activities."

        "abstract": "Sonya Bird, member of several IEC CB Taskforces, explains why gender should be considered when developing standards.",
        "content": "This year’s theme for World Standards Day was Shared Vision for a Better World, with a focus on the role international standards play in helping to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030.\nMany of these goals focus on the importance of diversity and equality—in education (SDG 4), as well as in the workplace and government leadership (SDG 5). In order for standards to help accomplish these goals, they need to be developed with consideration for all those they impact.\nAs director of International Standards, Sonya Bird is responsible for developing and implementing the international standards strategy at Underwriters Laboratories. In this role, she leads a team of regional managers located around the world, including in the ASEAN region, China, India, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Europe.\nShe is active in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) international forums, in the U.S. National Committee (USNC) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and in IEC itself, where she represents the United States on the IEC Standardization Management Board.\nSonya is also a member of the IEC Council Board Task Force on diversity (CB TF1), the IEC CB TF on Sustainable Development Goals (CB TF 3), and the IEC/ISO Joint Strategic Advisory Group (JSAG) on gender-responsive standards. \nIn this discussion, we asked Sonya to share her thoughts on gender diversity and the important role standards play in helping to achieve it.\nWhy should gender needs be taken into account in standards development?\nSimply put, one size does not fit all. Consider protective equipment, for example. Perhaps it is a pair of gloves worn by a female firefighter with small hands, or a vest intended to protect police officers from bullets. If this gear does not fit correctly, its protective nature may be negatively affected. The glove may not provide the needed protection from fire and heat, and although the vest may fit across the female chest, it may provide a gap in coverage from fitting too loosely across the rest of the torso. These differences need to be taken into account in order to help ensure first responders are adequately protected.\nWhat have you learned as part of the ISO/IEC JSAG for gender responsive standards?\nThrough participating in the JSAG, I’ve learned that some technical committees have historically been made up of male contributors and did not consider unique, specific needs of women in standards development. The individuals participating in the work of the IEC and ISO are experts in their respective fields but are not necessarily experts on gender differences. The JSAG recognized that guidance is needed to help all experts understand the value of gender-responsive standards, while also encouraging them to think about gender implications for new and revised standards. \nOther than physical sizing dimensions, what other factors exist when considering gender needs in a standard?\nPhysical differences other than sizing dimensions may include body fat percentage, peripheral vision, sensitivity to sound, pain tolerance, hormones, or various strength characteristics such as upper body strength and grip strength. Each of these conditions could have an impact on the suitability of requirements contained in a standard. Add to that mixture the traditional differences around roles played by men and women, and the evolving roles of women today, and it is clear that needs—with respect to standards—are changing. \nWhat other types of diversity are needed on technical committees?\nThe IEC CB TF on diversity identified the need for diversity across three segments. Geographical diversity was identified to promote global relevance of standards; gender diversity was identified to consider needs beyond those of just men in standards; and stakeholder diversity was identified to account for the needs of consumers, government agencies, academia, and regulators, in addition to the industry. \nIs diverse membership on a technical committee sufficient for addressing gender needs?\nWhile diversity on the technical committee is important, diversity cannot be achieved by simply including a woman on a committee. One woman should not be misperceived as a representative of all women. Just as needs and experiences vary for men, needs and experiences also vary for women, and a variety of female experiences and inputs should be taken into consideration in standards development. Technical committees are encouraged to consider non-biased/gender-responsive data in standards development when available. \nWhat is an example of a recent standards effort that specifically considered the needs of women?\nOne example of a recently published standard that accounted for gender inclusivity is UL 3741, the Standard for Safety for Photovoltaic (PV) Hazard Control. This standard addresses shock hazards for firefighters responding to emergencies on homes with PV systems. In its development, considerations were provided for both male and female firefighters. As research was collected, it was noted that physical characteristics such as body weight and skin sensitivity could have a direct effect on certain threshold limits for electricity, and that women tended to have lower threshold limits than most adult men. Both male and female firefighters were considered in the calculations of the potential current that could pass through a firefighter’s body during various firefighting interaction scenarios with a damaged PV array. As a result, for the protection of female firefighters in the U.S. and Canada, UL 3741 uses DC body resistance data as modified for females, which is roughly 2/3 the limits for males. \nYou are also involved with work at Underwriters Laboratories to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a whole. In what ways can standards play a role in supporting the UN SDGs?\nWorld Standards Day 2021 is about our shared vision for a better world, emphasizing the role of standards in helping to attain the Sustainable Development Goals. Standards play a vital role in eliminating global barriers to trade, enabling a foundation of trust for new technologies, supporting innovation and spreading knowledge. Standards also play an even greater role in addressing social imbalances, developing sustainable economies, and supporting mitigation and adaptation of climate change. I’m proud to be a part of this initiative, and I’m excited to see how we can use our experience and expertise in standards development to help achieve these goals.\nThis article originally appeared on UL.org and is republished with kind permission."

        "content": "“The reality of quantum computing is probably 10 to 15 years away, yet it merits our attention now,” says Dr Seungyun Lee of the joint committee on information technology (JTC1) set up by IEC and ISO. Experts expect quantum computing to bring massive benefits, such as accelerating medical research, making advances in artificial intelligence and perhaps even finding answers to climate change. \nThe computers we use today store data using binary bits, which are either on or off, represented as a 1 or a 0. Quantum computing uses qubits that have more states which are changing continuously. \nQubits can be on, off or somewhere in between all at the same time. This state is called “superposition” and enables qubit-based computers to carry out far more calculations much faster. \nWhen qubits become \"entangled\" they share all the possible combinations of the quantum states of the individual qubits, substantially boosting computational power in the process. \nA symposium co-organized by IEC, IEEE and ITU will bring together world-leading experts to look at quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs), which is a key enabling technology that will be critical for producing quantum computing cost-effectively at scale. It takes place on 2 November at 15:00 to 18:00 CET.\nDistinguished speakers will introduce the technology, report on the state of the art and the latest research, as well as enabling discussion on its ramifications for society, security and standards.\nParticipation is open to anyone interested in the subject.

        "abstract": "A workshop organized by IEC and Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs has explored the key interplay of artificial intelligence with standards, conformity assessment and legislation.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has a lot in common with dogs, at least when it comes to the law. The canine analogy came during an IEC Workshop, co-organized with the Directorate of International Law of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.\n“My dog used to be a guide dog but it's not anymore, so I can't take it on a train or a plane or into a café,” said Philippa Ryan, Associate Professor, Australian National University College of Law. She was addressing the IEC Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and the Interplay between Standardization, Conformity Assessment and Legislation.\n“If I cross the border from New South Wales into Victoria my dog needs to wear a seatbelt, so the rules change depends on where he is, and it depends on his job. Meanwhile, it also depends on what I trained him to do: if I train him to kill small rabbits then most people in the country won't care, but if I trained him to kill my next-door neighbour's pet bunny, then it’s going to be a problem”.\nProfessor Ryan explained that much like her dog, the regulatory environment in which artificial intelligence operates came down to context and the relationship with humans.  \nIn his presentation, Ambassador Roger Dubach of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs identified four reasons why AI is attracting attention at the level of international law. “It’s very relevant to discuss AI because behind all technologies are values and the export of technology equals the export of values,” argued Ambassador Dubach.\n“Secondly, it's hugely strategic and as AI is seen as strategic it heavily influences the legal discussions or in general, the regulatory discussions. The third point is that the relationship between human beings and machines is now changing. \n“With AI systems, traditionally law was made by humans for humans to be applied to humans. Now we have machines that are able to make recommendations, which gives rise to some fundamental legal questions. \n“And the fourth point is that AI systems enable completely new applications such as facial recognition and so there's also a huge discussion about these new applications”.\nThe Vice Director of the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology, Bobjoseph Mathew, emphasised the importance of conformity assessment. “It is really important to build trust, otherwise you cannot reap the benefits of AI,” he said.\n“It is important to maximize the benefits of AI, but this is only possible if we have a way to overcome the risks or to mitigate the risks and the compliance issues. One instrument for this is conformity assessment that demonstrates that a product or system meets specific requirements in the standards that are used”.\nWael Diab presented an overview of the development of standards for AI in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO. Mr Diab, who chairs ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC  42, highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the standardization work.\nSwedish lawyer Viveka Bonde, a member of SC 42, cited the example of the contributors to a new document providing an overview of ethical and societal concerns. “We have participation from, of course, the tech people, but we also have ethicists, and we have even business angels, we have lawyers, we have financial advisors, so we have a wide spectrum,” she said.\nGoogle’s Lenora Zimmerman, another expert working in SC 42, explained that when developing a standard, it was important to look at the work from the perspective of stakeholders. “You need to identify trustworthiness concerns to address at each stage and for each one of the stakeholders,” she said. “We’re thinking about it at the higher level of who it is going to impact and what it is going to be used for and what are the considerations that need to be taken into account”.\nClosing the workshop, IEC General Secretary Philippe Metzger said the dialogue initiated by the workshop would continue at an AI conference jointly organized by the IEC and the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, in Geneva, on 16 and 17 May 2022. He said the work being carried out by SC 42 and elsewhere in the IEC could support and complement the merging international framework for AI."

        "published_day": "2021-10-19",
        "abstract": "An update on IECEx from Thorsten Arnhold, former Chair of IECEx and current convenor of the new working group on hydrogen.",
        "content": "At the beginning of September, the annual Management Committee meeting of the international IECEx system took place. It was not surprising that, regardless of the global progress of vaccinations against COVID-19, this conference had to be organised as a virtual event – for the second time in a row. It is astonishing how professional and efficient international organisations like IECEx became adopted to such circumstances.\n\nThe work must go on, however, and so we switched almost all of our main activities to “remote” mode. The ongoing success of the IECEx system, expressed in continuously growing numbers of test reports, factory assessment reports and certificates, proves that all of our emergency activities have been effective and efficient. The only slight exception is the IECEx Personnel Competency Scheme (ExPCC) where the number of certificates stagnated during the last 18 months. However, this can be easily explained by the fact that practical skills are an important element of the examination process, and such special experiences are hard to test on a remote basis.\n\nAll delegates of the ExMC meeting were convinced that the number of certified persons will increase quickly once travel restrictions are removed. The “soft” aspects of safety like knowledge, practical skills and experience, have become even more important for the IECEx system, as indicated by the rapidly growing number of Recognized Training Providers (RTP). At the time of the ExMC meeting, 33 organisations from all continents granted with this status, as well as the next candidates, have all sent their application to the IECEx office in Sydney.\n\nAn interesting topic at the meeting was the presentation of the new ISO standards for the hydrogen value chains (I wrote about these documents in an earlier Hazardex column). During the discussion it became obvious that the matter has a growing relevance in many countries, which is why a new working group was established with the terms of reference: “To consider the business case for integrating Standards (including ISO and IEC), associated with the Hydrogen Economy into the IECEx System for reporting to the IECEx Executive and if accepted prepare IECEx Scheme documents for approval by the ExMC”.\n\nI feel honoured to be appointed as the convenor of this group, which will start with its activities this autumn. Some readers with experience in hazardous areas may be asking: what will the new content be given that IECEx equipment certificates for products with explosion group IIC have been available for many years? Beside Acetylene and Carbon Disulphide, Hydrogen belongs to this category. The answer can be given based on a NASA report: “Review of Hydrogen Accidents and Incidents in NASA operations” from 1979 by P.M. Ordin. Hydrogen has been used as a propellant in the space industry for many decades. Systematic evaluation of causes of accidents has revealed high statistical significance. The following failure categories could be identified as major issues:\n\nOperational and work area deficiencies – 26%: Accidents due to inadequate working conditions during installation, maintenance, fabrication and cleaning, as well as a lack of training, specific instructions or both.\n\nProcedural deficiencies – 25%: Accidents due to failure to follow established procedures or to prepare proper procedures.\n\nDesign deficiencies – 22%: Accidents due to inadequate component or system designs, including failure to specify safety devices, omission of other essential information, failure to determine stress and fatigue, errors in material selection.\n\nPlanning deficiencies – 14%: Accidents due to failure to prepare test plans or to prepare hazard studies.\n\nMalfunctions – 8%: Accidents due to anomalies, such as components in the system that failed to function as intended.\n\nSo, more than 90% of the accidents and incidents were caused by organisational deficiencies. The author of the report took the conclusion that safety strategies should aim in two directions:\n\n- To minimise potential human errors\n- To develop systems that remain robust in the event of human error\n\nTherefore, the major effort of the new IECEx working group should be spent on the search for hydrogen specific training and qualification needs. This could be a new unit of competency for the ExPCC system or new programs for the service facility scheme (ExSFC). Based on the new standards for assemblies (IEC 60079-46) and for non-electrical equipment (ISO/IEC 80079-36 ff.) there could be also a need for special equipment/assembly certificates.\n\nIt is true that for many decades there has been a large volume of hydrogen produced for industrial applications. Suitable equipment is available, and the safety concepts are sufficiently safe. However, there is a big difference between the current hydrogen production in large centralised and closed process plants like refineries and the new decentralised applications for hydrogen as an energy carrier: the public access by laypersons and other people who are not competent in the handling of a hazardous substance like hydrogen. Therefore, it makes sense to modify and extend the established safety concepts.\nThis article originally appeared in Hazardex magazine and is republished with kind permission."

        "content": "Peter Jensen, the Chair of IEC Technical Committee 13, which provides standardization for electrical meters, answers questions about current and future challenges for the industry and the committee itself, as smart grids roll out and market demands evolve.\nHow important are smart meters in helping grids to remain resilient and provide electricity for all despite increasing demand?\nIn developed countries, the meter has evolved from a simple billing device to becoming an integral part of the electricity network, which monitors energy levels and helps with load management. Carrying out advanced load control schemes is a cornerstone for building resilient grids with a capacity to support a high ratio of local renewable production as well as dynamic loads such as electric vehicle charging. Tomorrow this will be taken to another level as more and more battery storage will allow the import of energy to the grid for commercial purposes and also to support it when needed, to avoid energy shortages.\nIn developing countries, one major issue for utilities is still the high level of non-technical losses and unpaid bills. These lower the capacity of utilities to invest in modernizing the grid for instance and, over time, this can lead to a significant rise in outages. Various technical means have been integrated into the electricity meter to deal with this issue. An extremely efficient first step, which is being continuously improved, is the use of prepayment metering. With the new generation of connected smart meters, fraud detection can be taken to another level, using advanced data analytics. However, we can’t ignore that social aspects are also extremely important and how different countries tackle the topic varies considerably.\nHow has the scope of IEC TC 13 evolved over the years? What are the key challenges?\nIEC TC 13 has always played a central role as the standardization body for electrical energy measurement used for billing and load control. Many of our standards are stable workhorses that have been used for decades and have evolved to keep up with the latest technologies to include environmental conditions and electromagnetic compatibility changes. The advent of smart metering and the massive deployments of that technology around the world have created new challenges for us. Many countries base their legal frameworks on our standards and use them for various tenders. This means that, typically, when utilities or meter operators deploy meter systems, they can only use products that have been certified according to IEC Standards.\nThe IEC 62056 smart metering standardization framework for electricity metering data exchange, also known as the DLMS/COSEM™ suite, has been designed to be very flexible. A good example of the flexibility offered by this framework is that without changing the base of the standard, extensions have been made to support various communication profiles, amongst the most recent in the market. Products which are compliant to IEC TC 13 Standards include interoperability and the highest possible level of cyber security, which are essential qualities for utilities and meter operators. However, some of the biggest challenges may lie ahead of us. The rapid evolution in several application areas, in particular smart grids, the electric vehicle charging infrastructures and flexible load control, require metering, not only for billing purposes, but also to control and certify energy services are delivered. This requires setting up a good working relationship with other TCs to coordinate the work and make sure that standards are published in a timely matter as expected by the market. As electric mobility is an important future topic for standardization, it’s essential that IEC Standards cover all fields of this area, including billing and certification of charging services. IEC TC 13 Standards already cover a good part of what is required, but we know that complements are needed for our standards to fully satisfy these requirements. Another important task is to make sure that IEC TC 13 Standards are used globally to support requirements from regional markets.\nRead more in e-tech."

        "content": "Project Committees (PCs) are important contributors to IEC Standards. They are usually established by the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) to prepare individual standards that don’t fall within the scope of an existing TC or SC. The latest PC established by the SMB is PC 128 which plans to prepare documents containing broad and general principles concerning the operation of electrical installations. The PC is chaired by Jens Jühling from Germany and the Secretariat is held by Serge Yesso from France. The PC is holding its first ever plenary in a hybrid fashion in Paris at the end of next week, at AFNOR premises.\nAmong the many discussion topics for the 32 participants, of which about half will be present physically, will be the business strategy of the PC, the redefining of its scope (if required) and proposed liaisons with other TCs and organizations.\n \"It is an honour for me to chair the first meeting of PC 128 together with my French colleague, Serge Yesso. I am pleased to see that there will be many participants both here at AFNOR and online. I am an electrical engineer who has worked in accident prevention insurance in Germany for more than 15 years. I am also the Secretary General of the International Section on Electricity of the International  Social Security Association (ISSA). Both are functions that are very closely related to electrical safety. So it was only natural that I should apply to become Chair of PC 128,\" says Jens Jühling.\n\"I do believe that after the IEC General Meeting, this is the first IEC hybrid meeting of a committee, so it very exciting to see so many participants both at AFNOR and far away. As an Officer from France, I am looking forward to welcoming attendees at AFNOR in Paris. I expect that this first meeting will be productive and allow us to get to know each other and that it will be a good basis for our future work,\" says Serge Yesso."

        "content": "A high-level panel session has brought together the heads of the IEC, ISO and ITU-T to discuss the important role of standards in helping the world to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Over 130 participants followed the online event, which took place as part of the World Standards Day celebrations. \nEvoking Adam Smith, IEC General Secretary Philippe Metzger described standards as an invisible hand that although unseen was essential in our everyday lives. \n“The effects of standards are multiple.  They ensure safety, help market entry and enable competition which facilitates innovation. This leads to more efficiency and more sustainability. Without standards, the modern world would hardly be governable,” he said.\nAccording to the Director of ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, Chaesub Lee, the SDGs are a call for global action which will require collaboration and consensus in order to succeed. “We cannot imagine our daily lives without ICTs, especially after the pandemic,” he said. “ICTs contribute to all 17 goals, such as education, digital health as well as sustainable and smart cities. The benefits of digital transformation should be available everywhere for everyone.” \nSergio Mujica from ISO agreed. “It is quite difficult to think about our daily lives without standards, which are an invitation to excellence. They define what is the best possible way to do something.” Mr Mujica linked the work of standards to the SDGs, remarking that while the SDGs provided the objectives and timeframe, standards identified how to achieve these goals. \nMr Metzger stressed that international standards addressed the concerns of society and were essential for the post-pandemic recovery. “In general terms, IEC work has an impact on all 17 SDGs in one way or another,” he said. \n“If you look at our work process, it is quite clear that discussion on decarbonization and an all-electric society are underway. We have very clear pointers of what matters in the world and we need to address them.”\nThe theme for World Standards Day 2021 is “A Shared Vision for a Better World”. It marks the beginning of a multi-year campaign to raise awareness about the contribution of standards towards achieving the UN SDGs.\nWorld Standards Day is held every year to promote international standards as a crucial instrument for global trade and economic development. It is also a tribute to the collaborative efforts of the thousands of experts worldwide who develop the International Standards that make the products that we use safe and efficient.\n\n \nRead more about IEC and the UN SDGs"

This theme marks the beginning to a multi-year campaign to raise awareness about the important contribution of international standards to help achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As we continue to face the challenges of a global pandemic, the essential role of international standards in shepherding global solutions based on consensus is more essential than ever.\nA call to action\nThe SDGs offer a shared blueprint for building a better, more prosperous, and sustainable world by 2030. Also known as the 2030 Agenda, it recognizes that economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability must be addressed in tandem in order to achieve universal sustainable development.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment underpin the technologies and processes that enable the safe, reliable delivery of services such as education and healthcare. They remove barriers to trade while also providing regulators and consumers with the knowledge that products adhere to globally recognized requirements for safety, interoperability and performance. They facilitate access to markets and help build trust. As a result, cities are safer, infrastructure is more resilient and clean energy is accessible and affordable for all.\nJoining a global community\nInternational Standards developed by IEC, ISO, and ITU are based on international consensus and collaboration. They empower nations with real-world solutions to address the targets set out in the UN SDGs. Developed by thousands of experts from all over the world, they embody global know-how and cooperation.\nAs we move towards a future that is more inclusive, sustainable and fair as proposed by the UN SDGs, we must recognize the essential contribution of the standardization community. We stand united to work together to accelerate the 2030 Agenda, with standards for the SDGs, and our Shared vision for a better world.\nLet’s make our shared vision a reality."

The process involves many people worldwide, including IEC technical experts, national experts and National Committee staff.\nDuring the IEC General Meeting in Dubai, the IEC Academy and Capacity Building (ACB) ran a Standard in a day boot camp, aimed at helping newcomers to the standards development community better understand the process. Participants from over 40 countries from around the world joined the event remotely (68) and onsite (42).\n“It was the most complex bootcamp we’ve done to date. The result was perfect, a combination of presentations, hands on drafting and commenting, as well as consensus building giving participants an intensive training about how to effectively lead and make their voice heard in committees”, said Jan-Henrik Tiedemann, Head of IEC ACB – IEC Regional Director for the Middle East.\nHands-on learning\nParticipants gave feedback on the successful session:\n“My overall impression was super positive and that is also what I heard from everyone else. The format perfectly reflects the work in standardization and also shows how hard it is to find a consensus (and how long it can take). But all in all, an incredibly successful format - whether onsite or remote. Congratulations!”, said Lea Emmel, from Germany (onsite). \n“Very impressive activity with such a large group of participants”, said Wangtan Yuan, coming in remotely from China.\n\n\"The bootcamp was wonderful and well executed. I found it very useful to get tips on how to chair meetings and handle various scenarios that may pop up during the working group sessions. If possible, it would be nice for future events to go beyond one day so that all the areas of importance can be covered. I loved the experience, I learned a lot and I'm looking forward to more learning materials on the IEC Academy\", said Knollis Delle, from Ghana (onsite).\n \nThe Standard in a day bootcamp offers an intensive training for stakeholders new to standardization. It includes learning the process and roles of standardization, commenting, drafting, as well as consensus building in national and international environments.\nNormally run with National Committees for 10 – 20 people, the session was adapted for the hybrid IEC General Meeting for over 110 young professionals. Participants received their role and supporting documents in advance to arrive prepared. \nParticipants were given an introduction to standardization and learned about best practices for the technical committee working group meetings, during which standards are developed. Playing their roles, they worked as if developing a standard together, during the national breakout sessions, compiled all comments gathered, and finished with a working group meeting.\nFind out more about IEC Academy and Capacity Building"

        "content": "The Internet of Things, big data, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence are transforming the connection between technology and people. New and complex safety requirements have emerged with the expansion of intelligent systems.\nAs more machines are integrated into factory and logistic automation, mobility and healthcare processes, the need to ensure safe procedures for people working with machines is increasing.\nFor its annual conference held during the IEC General Meeting, the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) examined the topic of safety in the future. The conference, which brought together over 175 participants from around the world, began with welcome remarks from the IEC President, Dr Shu, and IEC Vice Present and Convenor of the MSB, Dr Tsutsumi.\nEvolution of the concept of safety\nThe concept of safety has changed over the past forty years. Starting with the principle of caution in the 1980s, safety has evolved to encompass guidance through modes of safe operation in the early 2000s to now incorporate the idea of well-being. With the publication of IEC 61508 on functional safety, the IEC “opened the world of safe digitalization,” according to the keynote speaker Dr Reinert. “However, functional safety leads to more complex safety equipment.”\nSince 2010s, new dangers associated with digitalization have emerged. The publication of IEC 62443 provides cyber security in the area of operational technology. With Industry 4.0, Reinert explains that trustworthy artificial intelligent systems will be necessary to enhance transparency and understanding (explainability).\nAccording to the second keynote speaker, Coen van Gulijk, “significant steps forward in thinking about safety in the future have been made as well as what steps are needed for its implementation.” He notes with satisfaction the engagement from industry on the risks and opportunities available with new technologies.\nVan Gulijk outlines the changes currently underway. Machines are becoming agile and skilful; they are starting to talk to each other and change interactions. He notes that “soon machines will come alive with intelligence.” Artificial intelligence impacts safety since it changes the way we interact with machines and our environment.\nIEC White Paper on Safety 2.0\nIn November 2020, the IEC published a white paper on the future of safety with van Gulijk serving as the lead project partner. Van Gulijk notes three key findings from the white paper.\nFirst, the IEC is a focal point for societal values and concerns, serving as a pillar of trust. Second, there is wide industry support and engagement. And, finally, the IEC can offer a blueprint for safety in the future by standardizing the interactions between intelligent agents of which the human co-exists alongside the machine and the environment.\nAccording to the white paper, the concept of safety will be delivered in an integrated system in which workers, machines and the environment collaborate. Based on this common understanding, the white paper introduces a collaborative framework called the tripartite system for safety to provide a systems approach to examining key elements of safety in the future. The collaboration will be made possible by information flows going back and forth between the different intelligent agents of the system: human workers, smart machines, and the IT-enabled environment in which they function.\nThe white paper, developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board, can be downloaded from the IEC website free-of-charge.\nCurrent IEC activities\nThe Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on Safety (ACOS), Philippe Juhel, provided an overview of the current technical developments and standardization activities underway in the IEC as they relate to safety in the future.\nAccording to Juhel, the new trends impacting safety are the adoption of intelligent systems as the primary drivers of the digital transformation, concerns about privacy, data integrity, transparency and the trustworthiness of new technologies, and recent technology that enable the collection of real-time information on certain safety risks especially between humans and machines\nEarlier in the year, ACOS undertook a survey of IEC technical committees to better understand their projects related to collaborative safety. It has identified three projects:\n\n\nTechnical Report on artificial intelligence by IEC SC 65A and ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 42\nInternational Standard by IEC SC 61J on autonomous floor treatment\nTechnical Report on smart manufacturing use cases by IEC TC 65"

IEC General Secretary Philippe Metzger introduced the session and highlighted some of the results of the IEC Academy in 2021, with the organization of 24 webinars, thousands of viewers online and more than 10,000 viewers accessing the recorded videos of the various events.\nAs the Head of IEC Academy and Capacity Building at the IEC and also Regional Director for the Middle East, Jan-Henrik Tiedemann said at the start of the Day, “we need to ask the question where do we go from here?\", revealing that, according to a survey carried out among Academy members, one of the results of the pandemic was the reduction in non-critical meetings and the elimination of low value acts. “Most companies have adapted and turned the crisis to their advantage,” he said.\nSeveral National Committee representatives shared their own experience, from Austria and China to Finland and France and while the experiences were similar, some of the conclusions were different. According to the Austrian NC Secretary Christian Gabriel, one of the results of having mainly online meetings is that the discussions tended to be more concise and efficient, and that there was a bigger participation from members.\nWorking from home also gave a high satisfaction to many who were better able to balance life and work. On the downside, it was more difficult to get to know new members and hybrid meetings could sometimes be a challenge, with strong rules required. Like many other NCs, he expects hybrid meetings to become the norm, moving forward.\nThe Standardization Unit Manager for AFNOR in France, Alioune Cisse, said that the country was able to maintain its standardization activities during the pandemic and also noted that meetings tended to be more efficient. But he also mentioned that consensus was hard to build online and that the lack of bilateral exchanges, which are typically a feature of F2F meetings, was problematic on some hot topics.\nWhile meetings are hybrid for now, he expects AFNOR to return to normal working conditions at the beginning of 2022, with full face to face meetings taking place as before, and hybrid meetings being the exception."

An official launch event took place on 30 September during which the Chair of IECEX, Paul Meanwell, delivered the keynote address.\nIECEx Certified Equipment Virtual Launch event\nOver 110 people attended the two-hour virtual launch event which brought together speakers from SIRIM, PETRONAS, IECEx and two Ex testing laboratories. As demonstrated by the participation levels and the lively discussion during the open forum, there is much enthusiasm for SIRIM joining the IECEx certified equipment scheme.\nAs Meanwell noted in his presentation, “This is an important milestone for Malaysia which has been a long-standing and active member country of IECEx. We welcome SIRIM as the 61st Certification Body (CB) in our worldwide network.” SIRIM is already a long standing and active IECEx certification Body in the IECEx Services Scheme and the IECEx Certified Persons Scheme, thereby enabling SIRIM to provide the complete package of IECEx Certification offerings.\nTo be accredited as an IECEx Certification Body, SIRIM has been peer assessed by IECEx experts. Meanwell remarked, “By auditing the facilities, we instil a global level of confidence that ensures the quality of the facilities, systems and personnel employed. As a result, customers have confidence in the services offered, peace of mind with products and services and the assurance of high levels of safety that come with IECEx certificates.”\nIECEx in Malaysia\nIn Malaysia, many industries rely upon IECEx to qualify organizations, products and the competency of personnel for installations in the region. For example, PETRONAS, a world leading energy company, fully supports the IECEx as well as SIRIM’s involvement in the system.\nSIRIM has already been operating within the IECEx system for many years as part of the Certified Services Scheme covering Ex repair workshops and inspection facilities. In addition, it has been issued over 600 certificates under the IECEx Certified Persons Scheme. It has now expanded its scope to include the IECEx certified Equipment Scheme following a full assessment by IECEx assessors.\nLooking to the future\nAs Meanwell noted, “IECEx is forward-looking with an active Executive Committee overseeing the systems operation.” He highlighted the active involvement of IECEx experts in IEC standardization activities and most notably IEC TC 31: Equipment for explosive environments and its working groups. IECEx also has the endorsement of the United Nations through the guidelines published by UNECE.\nA new working group has been set up to examine hydrogen technologies with a first meeting planned to take place at the end of the month."

Several women from the IEC community as well as from other organizations presented the work accomplished so far, but especially the work still to be done, to make science, engineering, technology and maths (STEM) careers more inclusive to the female gender as well as improve gender representation in the IEC and make standards more gender responsive. \nManager for International Standards Development at the Standards Council of Canada Lynne Gibbens presented the work done in the Council Board (CB) Taskforce on Diversity of which she is a member and of the Joint ISO/IEC Strategic Advisory Group (JSAG), mandated to create tools for technical committees to ensure standards are gender responsive, which she equally participates in.\nThe Taskforce on Diversity was established in 2019 and among its many actions it published an IEC Diversity Statement pledging to create, implement and track progress of a gender action plan for the IEC. This includes training to increase inclusiveness and collecting and sharing data as well as success stories and good practices, among other things. According to Lynne Gibbens, one of the main successes to be derived from the  work of the Task Force is the importance given to diversity in the new governance structure to be approved at this GM. \nThe JSAG has formed several working groups which tasks include establishing a checklist for committees to understand and assess how a new work item or revision project for an IEC or ISO standard may be affected by gender; guidance and recommendations on the use of non-biased gender responsive data in standards development and what to do when appropriate data is not available; recommendation for committees on how to incorporate gender diversity and inclusivity in work and language, etc…\nA representative from IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, presented a report on gender diversity in renewable energy, which can be read here: https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/Jan/Renewable-Energy-A-Gender-P….\nMarianna García Cortés, a member of the IEC CB Taskforce on the SDG and a former IEC Young Professional, gave a presentation on women in the Mexican quality infrastructure, based on figures from McKinsey. The report shows that women are massively to be found in entry level positions and disappear at CEO level. Promotion levels between men and women which are more or less equal when they start out, diminish drastically throughout the higher levels of organizations. Women also earn 22 % less than their colleagues for an equal job. The presentation was a useful reminder of the problems beyond the ones of standardization bodies in Mexico and more directly related to society at large.\nLast but not least, IEC Technical Officer Marianna Kramarikova presented the results of the #WomenatIEC campaign, launched by the IEC Communications Department during February and March 2021. Near 50 videos were posted and at the end of March, the reach was of 1,734,519 people, of which 29,751 engagements, 645,206 organic impressions  and 64,860 video views."

        "content": "The IEC General Meeting (GM), is currently taking place as a hybrid meeting for the first time in history, accommodating both physical as well as virtual participation. The GM is hosted by the IEC National Committee of the United Arab Emirates in Dubai.\nOne of the events of the GM is the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) Meeting, which took place at the weekend, also in a hybrid fashion. One of the highlights of the SMB gathering, is the opportunity to find out the latest publication results. IEC Standardization Director Pierre Sebellin presented the latest figures concerning the work of the various technical committees inside the IEC. The overall findings show a slight slowdown compared to 2020, a year which had a surprisingly high level of production despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n At the end of August 2021, the IEC has issued 403 publications, of which 333 are standards. These figures do not include the ISO/IEC Standards developed under ISO administrative lead. \nOn the other hand, the average development time of standards has come down in 2021, at 30,6 months compared with 32,6 months on average in 2020.\nThis could have a positive impact on late projects, according to Pierre Sebellin: “The late projects trend line shows an increase of 2% over the last two years. This is still a concern, but when looking at the average development time in 2021, it is 6% shorter than in 2020 (30.6 against 32.6). The possible interpretation is that the TCs are looking at shorter development times which they partially achieve.”"

The Forum was chaired by Battsengel Gurragchaa who currently serves as the IEC Affiliate Leader.\nGurragchaa began the session with an overview of the key achievement by the Affiliate Programme over the past year. \nCelebrating its 20th anniversary\nSince its launch in 2001, the Affiliate Programme has provided numerous countries with the opportunity to participate in the international standardization and conformity assessment activities without the financial burden of membership. Currently 84 countries participate in the programme of which 54 have adopted IEC International Standards.\nEarlier in the year, the Affiliate secretariat asked affiliate countries to respond to an online survey in order to better understand the impact of the programme. According to survey results, affiliates countries appreciate all the benefits of the programme with specific mention made of the access to the freely available IEC publications, the networking opportunities, and the IEC Mentoring Programme. Many of the challenges faced are due to a lack of stakeholder representation.\nMentoring programme\nEnabling affiliate countries to learn from the experience of IEC members is one of the objectives of the IEC Affiliate Country Programme.\nIn the past year, two new mentorship agreements have been signed within the framework of the IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme. The National Committee (NC) of Australia has agreed to mentor the National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) of Cambodia while the NC of Brazil will mentor the NEC of the Dominican Republic.\nAffiliate Conformity Assessment (ACA)\nIn 2013, the ACP put in place the Affiliate Conformity assessment (ACA) status to help affiliate countries better understand the benefits of the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. Since June 2021, new procedures have been implemented to simplify access to information through ACA prelude and ACA status. As of September 2021, eight countries are in ACA prelude while seven countries have ACA status.\nTwo ACA status events were organized earlier this year about the certification schemes under IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres, and IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications. Presentations from both workshops are available online.\nTo help affiliate countries refine their knowledge in conformity assessment, new online learning modules are available on the IEC Academy platform.\nRaising the ACP profile\nGurragchaa noted the importance of raising awareness about the Affiliate Country Programme. As Affiliate Leader, Gurragchaa represents affiliate countries within IEC governing bodies including the IEC Council Board Taskforce on SDGs (CB/TF 3) to share ideas on behalf of affiliate countries.\nShe concluded her presentation with a call to action, encouraging affiliate countries “to join meetings and discussion taking place at the regional level to network and deepen your knowledge about IEC standardization and conformity assessment activities.”"

An important focus of the workshop is how IEC standards can help the world to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nActing as the guide and mentor of the YPs in Dubai, where the GM is taking place, is Vimal Mahendru, President of Legrand India and IEC Ambassador on the SDGs. The task of the YPs is to develop a strategy for communicating the work of the IEC around SDGs one, six and seven to key stakeholder groups.\nThe IEC Blog spoke to Mr Mahendru.\nIEC Blog: Why has the IEC embraced the UN Sustainable Development Goals?\nVimal Mahendru: IEC was born in 1906, just after electricity was becoming available to the global community. In the last 120 years, electricity has brought about an immense amount of development, prosperity and well-being to the community. IEC is closely wedded to this engagement. And I am absolutely convinced that technology brought us here and technology is going to take us forward. IEC standards and conformity assessment schemes are at the heart of this activity. And that's why it is absolutely essential for IEC to be right there with the SDGs.\nIEC Blog: You said something at the workshop this morning that might surprise people who don’t know about the work of the IEC. The UN Sustainable Development Goals range from eliminating hunger to gender equality to achieving world peace. You said this morning that the IEC contributes to all 17 goals. Could you elaborate on that?\nVimal Mahendru: Absolutely. If you look at it today, IEC is at the heart of standardization for not only electrotechnology, but information technology, communication technology and, in fact, almost anything and everything that we call ICT and electrotechnology. With IEC at the heart of this, do you think there is anything in the world today you can do for well-being without electricity, without communication, or without integrating in some way with the computers and computing power around us? I think it's almost impossible. The very fact that I'm even communicating with you is thanks to technology. Every mobile phone has possibly 100 different IEC standards, which come together to give us a mobile phone which works anywhere and everywhere in the world. This is why I believe that IEC, its products and services, are absolutely at the heart of all the SDGs.\nIEC Blog: The IEC likes to think that the benefits of the Young Professionals Programme run both ways. The YPs are benefitting from your knowledge and experience. What are you hoping to get back in return?\nVimal Mahendru: If you look at my grey hair, I am one of the older generation. I got involved with the SDGs much later in my life. I wish I was younger, with more energy and more enthusiasm. This is the future. I mean, we're talking about the future of our own planet. Imagine the power when the youth gets involved with something as potent as the SDGs. I think that's the perfect combination. It doesn't need our experience. It needs youthful energy, enthusiasm, creativity, out-of-box thinking. That's the reason why I think the IEC Young Professionals are the ones who will really make an impact on this topic."

        "published_day": "2021-10-01",
        "abstract": "Learn more about IEC work in the field of wearable technologies.",
        "content": "According to research by IDTechEx, the wearable technology industry is expected to grow from USD 24 billion today to over USD 70 billion in 2025. And, unlike other sectors, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be an accelerator for many of the key trends driving wearable technology, such as the move towards remote patient monitoring and digital healthcare as well as the current embrace of fitness and wellbeing.\nRecent advances in technology have enabled wearables to be available in many different form factors. The trend towards devices that are increasingly small, thin and flexible is possible because of advances in miniaturization and new interfaces that move away from touch and towards voice or motion activation. As a result, wearable devices are becoming unobtrusive and nearly invisible.\nSuch a development has benefited the medical sector. For instance, electronic thin patches can be used to help manage diabetes or applied to the skin in order to continually monitor glucose levels and, in some cases, can pump insulin into the bloodstream. This is part of a move towards patient monitoring that can be used for both hospital inpatient supervision as well as part of outpatient care.\nRole of standards\nIn March 2017, the IEC set up Technical Committee 124 (TC 124) with the aim of providing standards in the field of wearable electronic devices and technologies which includes materials and devices that are patchable, implantable, ingestible as well as those made from electronic textile materials.\nAccording to Jae Yeong Park, Secretary to IEC TC 124, “The business environment of wearable technologies is rapidly expanding on a global basis, and we see the emergence of new markets and applications. Already, more than four thousand companies, including all major electronics multinationals, are developing wearable electronic devices and technologies for the global market.”\nThe standardization of wearable technologies is still in its early phases. However, according to Park, “There is a common agreement that only international standardization can reduce the cost and effort for early industrialization and provide effective guidelines towards stabilization and expansion of the market.”\nRecent publications\nIn 2021, IEC TC 124 issued its first publications consisting of three international standards and one technical report. IEC 63203-101-1 provides definitions to the vocabulary frequently used in relation to wearable technologies thus ensuring a common basis for the discussion of key concepts while IEC 63203-201-3 and IEC 63203-204-1, provide test methods related to e-textiles.\nE-textiles are well suited to monitor biological signals such as respiratory rates and cardiac signals. Alongside the e-textiles, a detachable electronic device needs to be connected in order to measure the information from the e-textile. Currently, no standardized connection interface exists between the electronic device and the e-textile although the conductive snap fasteners are the most commonly used. With IEC TR 63203-250-1, IEC TC 124 has provided a review of conductive snap fastener connectors and provides guidance for future standardization work regarding e-textile connectors.\nIEC TC 124 is currently developing 14 publications on topics such as test methods for electronic textiles and glove type motion sensors as well as the performance of fitness wearables. Moving forward, “TC 124 will provide standards for the relevant materials, devices and systems with a focus on adaptability and reliability. It is an exciting market with much potential for growth. We need standards that can reflect market demand,” concludes Park."

        "content": "On 30 September, the United Nations officially celebrates World Maritime Day to honour the two million seafarers who serve on merchant fleet. This year, the theme focuses on seafarers and their crucial role in world trade.\nInternational shipping transports more than 80 % of global trade and is considered one of the most cost-effective international transport methods for most goods. The IEC works closely with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop standards that ensure the safety of seafarers.\n\nIEC Standards for the shipping industry\nTwo IEC technical committees are dedicated to preparing international standards for the maritime industry. In agreement with the IMO, IEC TC 80 Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems has taken on the role of developing international standards for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), an internationally agreed set of safety procedures and communication protocols used to increase safety and make it easier to rescue ships in distress. It recently published IEC 63154 on cyber security requirements for maritime navigation.\nIEC TC 18 Electrical installations of ships and of mobile and fixed offshore units also cooperates with IMO where electrical systems on board ships are concerned. It publishes international standards in line with the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), an international maritime treaty that sets minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. IEC TC 18 recently published IEC 62742 which offers guidance on how to achieve electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC) on ships whose hulls are made from non-metallic material, including various composites like fibreglass.\nMany other IEC TCs develop international standards which are relevant to the maritime industry and help it plan a greener, safer, more secure and cost-efficient future. The IEC also administers four conformity assessment (CA) systems that certify that components, equipment, installations and systems used in the maritime industry conform to the specifications outlined in its international standards.\nEuropean Union regulation\nSince 1 September, the European Union requires that all EU-flag vessels conform to new bridge alert management (BAM) system testing standards. As per the EU Marine Equipment Directive (MED), all new vessels, as well as those undergoing retrofitting, will need to certify that their bridge systems are in conformity with two IEC standards – IEC 62923-1 and IEC 62923-2.\nIn 2018, the IEC published these two standards to allow testing for compliance with Resolution MSC.302(87) from the IMO. This resolution helps mariners manage and understand alerts with the aim of eliminating unnecessary audible and visual alarm announcements. The BAM system defined by the IMO helps to manage, handle and harmonize the presentation of alerts on the bridge.\nThe IEC Standards not only specify the testing for compliance with the IMO resolution but also provide interface requirements for the BAM equipment. These requirements do not apply to legacy equipment, but provision have been made for the requirements to be integrated as possible.\nMore information is available in the IEC briefing paper Marine transport."

Online meetings became the norm at the start of the pandemic and we are slowly adjusting to a situation where hybrid meetings (meaning face to face gatherings with a degree of online participation) are to become standard fare, moving forward. To pave the way for the new normal, IEC and ISO have jointly prepared a new guide on how to plan and run committee and working group meetings to ensure the highest level of participation (taking into account the different time zones), build the best consensus and speed up progress for the standardization projects. \nThe guide also provides guidance on what kind of decisions can be made between meetings to ensure the progress of standards and other actions and projects in the various technical committees.\nThree new abbreviations were agreed upon:\n\nF2F – Face to face meetings\nHYM - Hybrid meetings\nVRM - Virtual meetings\n\nThe guide gives an overview of how and when announce meeting dates, send out the agenda and documents required before as well as the minutes after they have taken place. It also gives advice on how to network during virtual and hybrid events.\nThis is the first version of the guide. Both organizations will gather user experience as a basis to develop the guide further.\nFor more information: IEC and ISO guide"

        "abstract": "Standardized off and weak grid refrigerators for use in remote and developing locations will help to meet several UN Sustainable Development Goals",
        "content": "According to a study by the FAO (the organization for food and agriculture of the UN), a third of the food produced in the world is wasted. This amounts to about 1,300 million tonnes per year.\nAccording to a WHO report, each year some 600 million people fall ill from eating food that has gone bad, of which about half a million die. These people are mostly in developing countries, where food preservation is an issue linked to poverty. \nWeak (WGR) and off-grid (OGR) refrigerators are one the ways of better-preserving food in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 17% of households have a refrigerator, and appliance ownership among off-grid households is substantially lower. Off-grid refrigerators can also contribute to the reduction of poverty by creating new business opportunities.\nHouseholds owning a fridge can increase their income by selling clean refrigerated water or other goods to local neighbours. Efficiency for Access, a global coalition set up to accelerate clean energy access through high-performing appliances, found that establishing cold chains as extensive and reliable as those in industrialized countries would raise food supply by 15% in developing countries – about 250 million tonnes.\nSeveral international associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are calling for standardization work to be carried out for performance and energy consumption testing of weak and off-grid refrigerators. Elisa Lai from CLASP, an international NGO that focuses on appliance and equipment energy performance and quality, explains: “Due to the lack of standardization, the off-grid and weak-grid refrigerators sold in the market demonstrate a wide variance of quality and performance.\nBy standardizing testing conditions and specifications for WGRs and OGRs at an international level, we hope to facilitate a more transparent market where the devices can be compared fairly and consistently and drive the markets in emerging economies such as Africa and South Asia towards higher quality.”  \nRequest for standardization to be discussed with TC 59 and TC 82\nContacts have been made with IEC Technical Committee 59, which develops standards for household refrigerating appliances. The TC publishes IEC 62552-1-2-3 which prescribes test procedures for grid-connected devices.\nThe IEC 62552 series are already being referenced in off-grid and weak-grid refrigerator test methods developed by market development programmes such as the Global LEAP Awards. Another potential opportunity is through TC 82, which publishes TS 62257-9-8, specifying the requirements for stand-alone renewable energy and hybrid systems for rural electrification.\nThe technical specification addresses the quality, safety and electrical compatibility of appliances with solar energy kits. The idea would be to incorporate OGR and WGRs under this standard for products that can be powered by the solar energy kits equal or less than 350 Watts.\n\nThe Secretary of TC 82, George Kelly, says: \"We have dedicated experts who have been addressing the needs of developing countries for the past two decades. We are happy to work together with IEC TC 59 and international organizations to develop an appropriate standard for off-grid or weak-grid refrigeration. We have notably been in contact with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) regarding this development.\"\nIn doing so, IEC would directly help to meet several UN Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 2 which aims to end hunger, SDG 3 which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, SDG 7 which is to supply affordable and clean energy or SDG 13 which is to avoid climate change.\nFor more information, contact patrick.beks@re-gent.nl"

        "content": "Increasingly, governments are announcing plans to reduce their carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy. Industry is re-evaluating supply chains. Consumers are seeking the right to repair products and opting for a lifestyle that embraces sustainability.\nRecognizing that standards can help to address the protection of the environment against the potentially detrimental impacts from electrotechnical products and systems, the IEC set up the Advisory Committee for Environmental Affairs (ACEA). The below (abridged) interview with ACEA Chair, Solange Blaszkowski, provides insight into its work.\nWhat is the role of ACEA?\nACEA provides advice to standards writers on how to incorporate environmental matters in their publications. We offer a forum for the discussion of these issues amongst IEC committees (TCs/ SCs/SyCs) and coordinate IEC work to ensure consistency and avoid duplication or conflict in IEC publications. However, we do not write standards, which is the responsibility of IEC committees. Instead, we develop guides to ensure that standards developers address issues that have an impact on the environment.\nACEA is in the process of developing a number of new guides. Can you tell us more about the new guidelines for defining halogen content terminology in IEC publications?\nGuidance is needed in order for the terminology used for halogen-related provisions to be uniform and clear. Careful consideration is also needed when selecting test methodology to determine halogen content. As a result, ACEA is developing a guide for standards developers on this topic.\nCredibility is another issue that ACEA is addressing. Why is it important to develop a guide on this topic?\nWe need to maintain or perhaps regain the trust of users in environmental performance claims about products. Environmental performance related test standards should therefore provide users of products with the same level of certainty as, for example, that for safety.\nThis guide, entitled Securing the credibility of IEC publications containing environmentally relevant provisions, will explore the concepts of real-life representativeness and anti-circumvention in addition to classic measurement principles (such as reproducibility, repeatability and accuracy), and cost. By reducing the scope for greenwashing, it increases trust in IEC publications.\nACEA is also undertaking a major revision of IEC Guide 109, Environmental aspects – Inclusion in electrotechnical product standards, and is developing guidelines to support the implementation of IEC Guide 108.\nThe third edition of Guide 108 defines the rules for addressing horizontal functions and horizontal publications. ACEA is preparing guidance in support of its implementation as it relates to environmental aspects, including defined processes, requested information, definitions, etc.\nRegarding Guide 109, the revisions will include information on new topics such as the circular economy, risk management, climate change and renewable energy.\nIn what ways is the work of ACEA relevant to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?\nThe UN SDGs recognize that sustainable development requires economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. In order to achieve economic growth and sustainable development, we must reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources, and the way we use resources to produce energy. The efficient management of resources and the way we dispose of waste and pollutants are important targets to reach these goals. ACEA helps IEC committees develop standards that can attain these objectives.\nThe full interview is available in e-tech."

        "content": "Internal arc-faults are explosive electrical events that can cause serious harm. Consequences can include severe injuries to those located nearby and damage to equipment resulting in long – and costly - power outages. Finding ways to mitigate arc faults are essential in electrical installations.\nThe effects of an arc fault can be reduced significantly with the application of arc fault mitigations systems. When the arc fault is detected, the detection device sends a signal to the arc-fault reduction device, e.g. a circuit breaker or a quencher, which can then mitigate the harmful effect of the arc-fault. To ensure the performance of these detection devices, the IEC has published a new standard, IEC 60947-9-2 ED1, Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear - Part 9-2: Active arc-fault mitigation systems - Optical-based internal arc-detection and mitigation devices.\nThis new standard provides methods to characterize the performance of electrical relays used to detect the light produced by the arc-fault. According to François Cazals, Convenor of the working group responsible for the development of this standard (IEC SC 121A WG 19), “Because of the risks associated with arc-faults, there is a growing need for arc-fault sensing and mitigation devices. IEC 60947-9-2 offers the performance assurances for such devices and help ensure the safety of low-voltage installations.”\nIEC 60947-9-2 addresses internal arc-fault control devices (stand-alone, multifunction or combined) as well as sensors used either to detect the optical effect of the arc-fault and that operate a mitigation device to minimize the effects of the arc-fault. Construction and performance requirements for these devices and sensors are defined as well as their electromagnetic compatibility. To ensure compliance with these requirements, a variety of different testing methods and their reporting are defined.\nAs Cazals notes, “With IEC 60947-9-2, we are enhancing the protection of people, power switchgear and control gear assemblies against the effects of internal arc-faults.”"

        "content": "A recent IEC workshop brought together representatives from IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, and 48 participants from the IEC Affiliate Country Programme (ACP) to learn more about the IECRE solar photovoltaic (PV) energy scheme. The workshop, organized by IEC Affiliate and IECRE Secretariats in collaboration with the IEC Academy, was moderated by the Chair of IECRE, Alistair Mackinnon.\nThe workshop began with a welcome from the IEC Affiliate Leader, Battsengel Gurragchaa, who noted the strong interest affiliate countries have in topics such as energy efficiency and renewable energy based on the feedback received in a survey conducted earlier this year. This workshop is the second in a series that will allow affiliate countries to better understand IEC activities in conformity assessment.\nThe importance of IECRE\nAccording to Jing Bian from the China Quality Certification Centre, the international renewable energy market for new installations is estimated at USD 250 billion. In order to protect investments in renewable solar energy and ensure the system’s performance and efficiency, IECRE offers certification of the entire lifecycle of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant, from initial design aspects to annual inspections and ultimate asset transfer.\nAs noted by Ellen Hyldgaard from Vestas Wind Systems, the IECRE PV sector operates within the scope of the standards developed by IEC Technical Committee 82 as well as other relevant, internationally accepted standards and best practices. “IECRE focuses on issues specific to the PV sector and value that can be provided to investors and stakeholders within the sector,” remarked Hyldgaard.\nA distinction is drawn between the role of IECRE, which certifies systems and IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, which certifies products, including PV modules and inverters.\nThomas Sauer from EXXERGY detailed the importance of certification, noting the negative impact that severe storms or wind can have on a solar plant that is poorly designed. Climatic conditions, such as hot and harsh climates, dust and sandstorms, can corrode plastic component parts, including cables, the junction box and back sheets. As Sauer noted, “all PV projects have site specific needs that are addressed by verifying compliance to IECRE documentation.”\nCase study from Kenya\nAnne Wacera Wambugu, a member of IEC System Committee on LVDC and a former Young Professional from Kenya, detailed the challenges facing consumers in an increasingly decentralized energy market and noted the need for a systems level approach in African countries. “Decentralization of the energy system is underway and resulting in the decentralization of all aspects of the energy ecosystem, including the workforce.” As a result, products are often discarded, and investments lost.\nAffiliate Conformity Assessment (ACA) status\nThe IEC encourages affiliate countries to adopt IEC International Standards and to recognize and implement IEC Conformity assessment certificates and reports at the national level. Through the Affiliate Conformity Assessment (ACA) status, affiliate countries acquire knowledge about the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems and benefit from the advantages of implementing conformity assessment certificates.\nThe IEC organizes ACA status events on a regular basis using an approach that combines theory and implementation. Last May, the IEC ran a workshop about the certification schemes under IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres. The presentations, including the recording, are available online."

        "content": "Since its launch in 2001, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme (ACP) has enabled numerous developing and newly industrialized countries to join the global standardization and conformity assessment community.\nA key representative for the Programme on a number of IEC governing boards, the IEC Affiliate Leader serves as the collective voice for affiliate countries. Since 1 January 2021, this role has been filled by Battsengel Gurragchaa.\nGurragchaa is the Head of Standardization and Conformity Assessment Policy Department at the Mongolian Agency for Standardization and Metrology (MASM). In the below interview, she provides insight about her objectives as Affiliate Leader, the UN SDGs and how Mongolia has benefited from the ACP.\nWhat are your objectives as Affiliate Leader?\nDepending on the region, culture and/or development level, affiliate countries face varying challenges to participate in IEC work.\nAs IEC Affiliate Country Leader, I plan to identify our greatest challenges in consultation with the Affiliates and collaborate with the IEC ACP Secretariat to help the affiliate countries extract full benefit from the programme. \nLast March, the ACP secretariat conducted a survey to seek feedback on the utilization of the Programme, its benefits and relevance, as well as to assess the needs of the affiliate countries on training and capacity-building activities.  [Ed: Read blog post about survey results]\nHow can standardization help to achieve the UN SDGs?\nSustainable development is an issue not only for countries, but also for international and regional organizations. With 84 affiliate countries, the ACP represents nearly half of the IEC community.\nIn my opinion, the IEC should develop an IEC SDG leadership programme. In affiliate countries, the Presidents and Secretaries of the NECs are IEC ambassadors for their country and can convey the role of the IEC in helping to achieve the SDGs through the wide use of its standards with support from e-learning and training courses. Affiliate countries need to develop a plan to use standards to support the achievement of the SDGs for our future.\nWhat have been the benefits to your country through its participation in the IEC Affiliate Country Programme?\nSince 2015, Mongolia has established its National Electrotechnical Committee (NEC) and I have been involved as NEC Secretary. Through the ACP, the NEC and our stakeholder representatives have been able to access and adopt IEC Standards, participate in IEC general meetings and learn about the benefits of standardization and conformity assessment.\nThe establishment of the NEC has improved stakeholder cooperation since it provides an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss and consult under one roof. We have also participated in webinars organized by the IEC Academy and web meetings facilitated by the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (IEC APRC). This support has enabled us to raise the awareness of the NEC, which is essential for engaging stakeholders."

        "content": "Mobile phone calls, messaging and online banking all rely on complex mathematical algorithms to scramble information in order to protect them from hackers, spies and cybercriminals. It is no exaggeration to say that there would be no confidentiality or security online without encryption and that many of the operations we take for granted today would no longer be feasible. \nFaced with increasing cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure — including but not limited to power utilities, transport networks, factories and the health care industry — encryption is evolving to meet the threat.\nThe most prevalent system nowadays is called public key encryption. It works by giving users two keys: a public key, shared with everyone, as well as a private key. The keys are large numbers that form part of an intricate mathematical algorithm that scrambles a user’s messages. \nThe sender encrypts a message by using the receiver’s public key in order that only the intended recipient can unlock it with her or his private key. Even though the public key is freely available, the numbers involved are sufficiently large to make it very difficult to reverse the encryption process with only the public key.\nFrom quantum to post-quantum\nAs computers become more powerful, however, and in the face of rogue states with the technology resources to pose a more serious threat, cryptographers are turning away from mathematics and looking to the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve greater security. \nQuantum cryptography is based on the behaviour of quantum particles. For example, an encryption system called quantum key distribution (QKD) encodes messages using the properties of light particles. \nThe only way for hackers to unlock the key is to measure the particles, but the very act of measuring changes the behaviour of the particles, causing errors that trigger security alerts. In this way, the system makes it impossible for hackers to hide the fact that they have seen the data.\nThe problem is that we may be no more than 10 years away from fully functioning quantum computers that are capable of breaking current cryptographic ciphers. Experts in the IEC and ISO Joint Technical Committee for information technology believe that the development, standardization and deployment of post-quantum cryptography is a top priority.\nFor this reason, ISO/IEC JTC 1/ Subcommittee 27 has set up a working group. They hope that their work on post-quantum cryptography will help to minimize the risk of a potential security and privacy disaster."

        "abstract": "As standardization on e-waste moves forward inside the TC, countries from the developing world are increasingly required - and willing - to take part as they are one of the key stakeholders.",
        "content": "Since he became Chair of IEC Technical Committee 111, Christophe Garnier has been focused on widening the membership of his TC to include a greater number of emerging member countries.\nSome of these efforts have paid off, as the most recent member to join the TC is Uganda. The country is an associate member of the IEC since 2020 and the Ugandan National Committee is the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS).\n“We are delighted that Uganda has joined TC 111, we look forward to working with Ugandan experts on our different standard projects. We strongly encourage other emerging nations to join, we would particularly like to have input from Kenya and Ghana,” Garnier rejoices.\nThe TC, which deals with the environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems, produces standards to mitigate the impact of products on human health as well as on resource depletion or water pollution. IEC TC 111 Standards are also essential tools to better manage and treate e -waste at an international level, while aiding manufacturers to meet legislative requirements on hazardous substances control. \nStandards which improve the eco-design of products have been developed to help customers select goods which have less of a negative effect on the environment. Another key aspect is managing the end of life of materials and goods. \nIn all these aspects, standardization must include developing countries alongside developed nations as all areas in the world are concerned. E-waste is a mounting problem for developing nations. As Garnier indicates: “E-waste is a global topic affecting not only the countries using the electrical and electronic equipment that generates the waste, but also, and very importantly, those countries that collect e-waste for end-of-life treatment.”\nThe notorious Agbogbloshie scrap yard in Ghana emits toxic fumes that endanger the lives of nearby populations. While Ghana has taken many measures and developed legislation to counter the problem, a global standard with input from the nations most concerned would be a big step forward."

        "abstract": "The experts who develop the JPEG file format are working on an international standard to make it easier to detect fake media.",
        "content": "Even a cursory glance at history is enough to understand that there is nothing new about fake media. A good example is Richard III of England, whose surviving portraits show a twisted and deformed hunchback, with narrow, dark eyes and cruel, thin lips. \nThanks to modern scanning techniques we now know that the paintings were altered by Tudor propagandists to create the evil monster that Shakespeare called a “poisonous bunch-backed toad”.  A facial reconstruction based on the skull of Richard III suggests that he was somewhat better looking, while his skeleton reveals that while he was short of stature, he did not have a humped back.\nRichard III was a victim of what UNESCO defines as ‘disinformation’ — information that is false and deliberately created to harm a person, social group, organization or country. UNESCO contrasts this with ‘misinformation’ — information that is false but not created with the intention of causing harm — and ‘malinformation’ that is based on reality but intended to cause harm, often by moving private and confidential information into the public sphere.\nThe technologists and scientists responsible for the JPEG picture format — the acronym stands for the Joint Photographic Experts Group — are developing a backwards-compatible standard that they hope will make it easier to create media that protects source information and safeguards intellectual property rights. They hope it will help journalists and insurance investigators, among others, to verify the authenticity of photos and video.\nThe new international standard will also benefit artists who have seen their original digital works minted as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) by scammers. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought and sold like physical property, with some fetching tens of millions of dollars at auction.\n\nThe standard should also make it easier to spot so-called 'deepfakes', computer-generated clips that not only distort reality but could also destroy the reputations of their victims. Detecting deepfakes is expected to become more of a challenge as the technology improves. \nThe JPEG members, who are part of the IEC and ISO joint technical committee, JTC 1, are at pains to point out that not all fake media is necessarily bad or malicious. Special effects in movies, photographers creating different versions of an image for different purposes, or radio journalists removing ums and pauses from interviews are all examples of media manipulated for good reasons. \nJTC 1 develops international standards for information technology. The ISO/IEC and ITU Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is part of JTC 1 subcommittee 29, which covers coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information.\nThey are responsible for the popular JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPSearch, JPEG XT and more recently, the JPEG XS, JPEG Systems, JPEG Pleno and JPEG XL families of imaging standards.\nThe JPEG format is the most widely used image format on the internet, with billions of JPEG images produced every day. JPEG and MPEG experts have won a number of Emmy awards in recent years for their ground-breaking contributions to the global audiovisual industry.\n \nFind out more\nJPEG Fake Media: Context, Use Cases and Requirements\n2nd JPEG Fake Media Workshop Proceedings"

        "abstract": "The IEC is undertaking a new project to address e-waste. Learn more about this work led by IEC TC 111.",
        "content": "The ubiquity of electric and electronic products has resulted in growing volumes of e-waste. According to the latest Global E-waste Monitor, 53,6 million tonnes of electrical and electronic waste was generated in 2019. At current rates, a projected 74,7 million tonnes of e-waste will be reached by 2030.\nThe cost of e-waste is high for the environment. If not properly disposed, e-waste releases toxic substances that can seep into the air, water and soil. As notes Christophe Garnier, Chair of IEC TC 111 which develops horizontal environmental standards for electrical and electronic products, “E-waste is a global topic affecting not only the countries using the electrical and electronic equipment that generates the waste, but also, and very importantly, those countries that collect e-waste for end-of-life treatment.”\nMany countries have placed obligations on manufacturers to ensure that their products are properly recycled and disposed once they reach the end of their usefulness. With extended producer responsibilities, manufacturers are responsible for the product throughout its lifecycle, including product take-back, recycling and final disposal.\nYet, extended producer responsibility has not been made obligatory in all parts of the world. According to Christian Dworak, Convenor of the IEC working group on e-waste (IEC TC 111 WG 18), current studies estimate that approximately only one-third of e-waste is handled by official channels and properly tracked and disposed. However, Dworak notes, “The remaining two-thirds is disappearing. While it is assumed that some of this waste may be reused or recycled, it is not clear how much.”\nA worldwide approach to reduce e-waste\nIn May, the IEC agreed to move forward with a new project that addresses e-waste. Led by Dworak, this proposed horizontal standard aims to facilitate the systematic, sustainable management of e-waste. Among its objectives, it seeks to reduce the amount of e-waste sent for disposal through reuse and recovery, prevent the inappropriate disposal of e-waste and restrict operators who do not comply with the standard or comparable requirements from receiving e-waste shipments.\nAccording to Dworak, “This new project on e-waste is the first time that product end-of-life management of waste is addressed by the IEC. We have had discussions on product design and performance but never discussed requirements on how to operationally handle worldwide product extended producer responsibility, reuse and recycling.”\nThe first meeting of IEC TC 111 WG 18 will take place virtually on 20 September. Interest in this work is high and efforts are now underway to ensure the involvement from all parts of the world. As Dworak remarks, “Because e-waste does not stop at national or regional borders, there is a need for an international approach to the treatment and the preparation for the reuse of e-waste.”\nTo ensure that the proposed standard includes the requirements of countries, the Chair of IEC TC 111 is inviting countries that are not yet members of the IEC TC 111 but involved in the management of e-waste to participate in this work. As Garnier notes, “We need experts from around the world that can convey the requirements from their national regulations or practices regarding e-waste management. By doing so, we will help ensure that the future standard will be accepted and adopted by their national e-waste industry.”"

He used the example of shipping containers which, before 1956, were metal or wooden boxes and barrels in a variety of shapes. After 1956, using standardized containers brought down the cost of shipping per tonne from USD 5,8 to USD 0,16!\nWhy international standards?\nArnhold explained that IEC experts from around the world develop consensus-based international standards, which are a major factor in global business. They ensure the safety and functionality of electrical products and are key elements for manufacturers, plant operators and regulators.\nWhy IEC Conformity Assessment?\nArnold defined conformity assessment as “the demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled”.\nWhat is the relevance of IEC CA? Nowadays, there are hundreds of national or regional certification marks, each with its own set of rules and requirements. As a result, repeated testing and certification and duplication of effort can be costly for customers who usually end up paying. The obvious solution is the mutual recognition – one certificate accepted throughout the world – which can be achieved by using IEC CA Systems.\nCA provides safety, quality, interoperability and consistency, as well as tangible benefits for the different stakeholders by:\n\nhelping countries meet their obligations vis-à-vis the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade agreement.\nreducing delays and costs of multiple testing — one certificate can be accepted everywhere.\nproviding assurance that goods will perform to expectations and are reasonably safe.\n\nConformity assessment offers broader and faster access to market at less cost and builds trust.\nHow do the Systems work?\nArnhold provided a a brief description of each of the four IEC CA Systems (IECEE, IECEx, IECQ and IECRE) and explained how IEC provides the infrastructure for the CA Systems: rules, procedures, operational documents according to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards; standards formats and templates; online database, training, marketing and more.\nCountries are represented in each System (national committee or selected member body) and the “peer to peer” principle that governs the acceptance of certification bodies and test laboratories.\nCheck out the webinar and presentations on the IEC website"

Hospitals, manufacturing plants, airports, aircraft and even some schools have been using various UV-C devices to destroy the virus in closed environments. Manufacturers around the world have been responding to the demand.\nUsing UV-C devices for germicidal purposes is not without risk, however. UV-C irradiation can cause injury to the skin and eyes if people are in the vicinity of the device for a too long period of time. The pandemic prompted both IEC and the Global Lighting Association (GLA) to act together quickly to limit the risks of using such equipment. A publicly available specification (IEC PAS 63313) has been issued as a result of these joint efforts.\nIEC Technical Committee 34 Vice-Chair John Gielen explains how the PAS was developed: “the photobiological safety standard, IEC 62471, classifies UV-C safety, but there are no international standards with comprehensive specifications on how to use UV-C products in a safe way, especially in the presence of people. The GLA published a recommendations document which establishes the first guidelines based on the currently available state of the art information on UV-C light used for germicidal purposes. Its aim is to help manufacturers, installers and users to safely implement these devices. The GLA published the document in May last year and the IEC decided to adopt it as a Publicly Available Specification (PAS). The adoption process was super smooth and went very quickly: in less than a year we managed to get agreement from both the GLA and IEC on the PAS and how we should position it. We view it as a basis for future standards in collaboration with other organizations.” \n For more on this topic read the e-tech article."

They also form the basis for testing and certification to ensure that devices are safe and perform as expected.\nWhen regulators refer to IEC Standards in their laws, they provide basic quality and safety levels that help protect citizens and the environment. These can also help protect the national economy from the negative impact of imports of unsafe products.\n“The National Committee of Mexico is active in IEC and represented with excellence by notable personalities in the IEC Council and Council Board.  It has also sent successful participants to the IEC Young Professional Programme and developed its own national programme to attract the interest of a new generation of experts”, said Metzger.\nIEC International Standards represent an essential tool for Mexico to further develop the local electrotechnical, electronic and related industries, and expand its participation in international trade. Further participation in IEC activities would ensure that Mexico national needs are considered globally, open more markets to Mexican products and allow Mexico to tap into even broader global expert knowledge and know-how.\nDigitization of standards\n“We are living in a multistakeholder environment and meeting future needs of the digital economy and society is of the essence. We will only be able to do so by fully embracing digitization”, said Metzger.\nIn the future, IEC aims to provide new digital standards formats that are fully tailored to the needs of each type of user. So-called SMART standards will change how standards are developed and distributed, and far beyond technical aspects, they will also impact commercial and legal considerations. This will result in new ways of working and new business models. IEC together with ISO is currently exploring the path towards SMART standards and putting in place the appropriate structures and processes for this to succeed.\nNeed for global cooperation\nIn electrotechnology, innovation is rapid and no individual company or organization can develop everything alone. Despite fierce competitiveness, more than ever companies must collaborate to deliver the broad solutions for increasingly complex systems.\nMetzger concluded by stressing that the standardization community must closely cooperate with other organizations, to avoid contradictions in standards and ensure compatibility between different standards whenever possible, including in new technology areas."

Developing the latest draft has seen the number of active national committee members almost double along with the contributor feedback showing the global interest this has attracted.\nCo-conveners Des Ward, from Australia, and Mr Christophe Grangeat, from France, needed to significantly adapt the ways of working like most international committees during Covid. “Without face-to-face meetings, it was critical to set realistic expectations and readjust timings,” said Mr Ward, “Along with forming smaller ‘break out teams’ and rotating meeting times to suit the truly global membership have all been key factors in making it work”.\nIt would be fair to say the workload has significantly increased for conveners during these times and a review of lessons learned will be so vital at the end. I would like to congratulate the Co-conveners Des and Christophe, the breakout team leaders and all of the TC106 members contributing to this new standard. The collaborative culture in TC106, where all members are looking out for each other and supporting one another, has really made a difference in achieving a quality standard.\nThe latest draft is now ready for National Committees to review and vote. It’s a great opportunity to look at the latest 5G test methods, which truly represents the world’s best practice and have your say.\nWe welcome your feedback."

What if it only worked within countries and you could only send emails or use Zoom nationally”, said Philip Wennblom, Senior Director of Standards Policy for Intel Corporation, in his keynote at the Society for Standards Professionals (SES) 70th Annual Conference.\nWennblom has participated in different standards development organizations throughout his career. He currently chairs the IEC and ISO joint technical committee which develops international standards for information and communication technologies and covers many areas, including artificial intelligence, biometrics, cloud computing, data management and much more.\nThe event’s theme was the The future of standardization with sessions covering the digital future of international standards, diversity and inclusion, innovation, quality and safety, best practices and conformity assessment.\nCommon principles across standards development organizations\nIn recent years global trends have moved towards nationalistic policies in many countries including India, the UK and US, Wennblom noted. “We need to embrace the best ideas from everywhere to be sure these ideas don’t become fragmented and used for national interest only.”\nThe six main principles of standards development have worked for decades and have never been more important. Standards development is diverse, open, consensus-based, voluntary, international and private sector led.\n“Standards developers must continue to be open and inclusive to ensure diversity. In the past this meant allowing everyone to attend meetings, now it means enabling everyone to attend. The silver lining of the pandemic is that we’ve had more participation from people everywhere. Post pandemic we need to keep meetings open and diverse.”\nSecuring the future\nIt is important to recognize the proven standards development model. While government participation is needed and should be embraced, to achieve standards implementation, private sector leadership must be reinforced.\nAbout SES\nThe Society for Standards Professionals (SES) is a not-for-profit professional membership society dedicated to furthering the knowledge and use of standards and standardization. SES provides a neutral forum where standards users and developers can come together to address mutual issues, opportunities, and interests in ways that work to the benefit of everyone involved with, or affected by, standards. SES members are primarily involved in the development, application, and use of company, government, national, regional, and international standards."

        "content": "Sir Tim Berners-Lee raised over five million dollars when he made his source code for the world-wide-web available as a digital collectable earlier this year. It was perhaps inevitable that Spider-Man, the world’s best known serial spinner of webs, would follow him into the world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).\nNFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought and sold like physical property, although they have no tangible form of their own. Any digital objects can be “minted”, or made available on the blockchain as a token, to become an NFT.\nNot surprisingly, given the large sums that some digital collectables are fetching a JPEG file by the artist Beeple sold for an astonishing USD 69m in March. There have been concerns about NFTs and the digital assets they rely on.\nSeveral artists have already discovered their work in NFTs minted by scammers. One of the latest victims is the founder of an NFT videogame who “lost” 16 algorithmically generated art images, known as CryptoPunks, to the scammers.\n“This is precisely why we need a more secure and more trustworthy NFT standard, which is media-centric and network-agnostic,” said EPFL Professor Touradj Ebrahimi, who chairs the expert group responsible for the JPEG image format.\n\nAccording to Professor Ebrahimi, the JPEG group that he convenes, in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO (JTC 1), has been weighing the potential benefits of developing standards for NFTs. The first step is to gain a deeper understanding of imaging requirements for NFTs\nThe JPEG experts will also look for ways that JPEG standards could help bring security and trust to NFTs and facilitate interoperability in a wide range of applications.\nJTC 1 develops international standards for information technology. The ISO/IEC and ITU Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is part of JTC 1 subcommittee 29, which covers coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information.\nThey are responsible for the popular JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPSearch, JPEG XT and more recently, the JPEG XS, JPEG Systems, JPEG Pleno and JPEG XL families of imaging standards.\nThe JPEG format is the most widely used image format on the internet, with billions of JPEG images produced every day.

        "content": "The Society for Standards Professionals (SES) 70th Annual Conference included a session for Diversity and Inclusion: Driving Change Through Action and talked about IEC activities in this area. Sonya Bird, member of the IEC Council Board Task Force on Diversity and the IEC Council Board TF on Sustainable Development Goals and representative for the IEC on the IEC/ISO Joint Strategic Advisory Group on Gender Responsive Standards, participated in the session, along with Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, HPC Programming Models Architect at NVIDIA.\n“Consider other differences beside physical size that may exist between men and women. This could include body fat percentage, peripheral vision, sensitivity to sound, pain tolerance, hormones or various strength characteristics (upper body strength or grip strength). Each of these could have an impact on the suitability of requirements contained in a standard. Add to this the traditional roles played by men and women and how these are evolving today. It is clear that needs with respect to standards are changing,” said Bird.\nIEC establishes Task Force for diversity\nIn 2019 the IEC Council Board established a task force (TF) on diversity to assess the current situation, including gender in governance and IEC activities, and make recommendations for improvement. The TF considers gender, geography, stakeholder diversity and one of its key outputs is the IEC diversity statement which speaks to the need for diversity in the IEC.\nAccording to Bird, gender diversity is encouraged at all stages of standards work from drafting to maintenance team level to the committee level in leadership roles such as convenors and technical officers and even at management board level such as SMB of which she is a member or the Conformity Assessment Board. The TF recognizes that with more diversity in the system the standards might be more relatable for all.\nIEC and UN SDGs\nThe IEC also has a TF to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including SDG 5 for gender equality. “This TF is important for addressing gender issues at IEC. The work is ongoing and I’m pleased to contribute to the efforts of this group, which considers education and communication within the IEC community regarding SDGs”, said Bird.\nMaking progress\nWhile there is still work to do to achieve more gender balance in IEC management, Bird highlighted the fact that over 30% of IEC Young Professionals are women, “YPs are the life blood of the future of IEC, so this is very positive. As we have more females involved at young ages this should help increase female participation and leadership at all levels.”\nWorking with ISO on gender responsive standards\nBoth IEC and ISO have recognized the need for gender responsive standards and created the Joint Strategic Advisory Group (JSAG), which is mandated to create tools for technical committees that ensure standards are gender responsive.\nHistorically many committees have been made up mostly of men, who have not considered unique specific needs of women when developing standards. The thought process was that standards were sufficient for all.\nJSAG is developing the following:\n\nChecklist for committees to understand and assess how a new work item or revision project for an IEC or ISO standard may be affected by gender.\nGuidance and recommendations on the use of non-biased gender responsive data in standards development and what to do when appropriate data is not available.\nRecommendation for committees on how to incorporate gender diversity and inclusivity in work and language.\nComprehensive communications plan on how to achieve gender responsive standards.\nA baseline for measuring progress. This will build on the above items and suggest key performance indicators that IEC and ISO can use to track the effectiveness of the JSAG recommendations addressing gender responsive standards.\n\nExample of a gender responsive standard\nDuring the Q&A Bird shared an example of a standard developed by her company, that considered the needs of women. The standard was for safety for solar photo voltaic (PV) hazard control. It addressed shock hazards for firefighters responding to PVs on homes.\nThe shock issues for women differed from those for men and these aspects were addressed in the development of the standard. Male and females were considered in the calculation of the potential current that could pass through a firefighter’s body during firefighter interaction scenarios with a damaged PV system. It was found that the body resistance data for women was roughly 2/3s of the limits for those for men which had to be reflected in the requirements of the standard.\nAbout SES\nThe Society for Standards Professionals (SES) is a not-for-profit professional membership society dedicated to furthering the knowledge and use of standards and standardization. SES provides a neutral forum where standards users and developers can come together to address mutual issues, opportunities, and interests in ways that work to the benefit of everyone involved with, or affected by, standards.

        "content": "IEC CEO and General Secretary, Philippe Metzger gave the keynote speech on the first day of the Society for Standards Professionals (SES) 70th Annual Conference which attracted participants from around the world. The theme of the three-day event is the Future of standardization.\nMetzger focussed on critical issues for the future of international standards and conformity assessment, the IEC response to the pandemic, and other challenges and opportunities faced by the organization, such as diversity, developing global reach, the impact of digitization, addressing society’s concerns about new technologies, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n“IEC Standards and conformity assessment will continue to play a critical role, starting with the post-COVID-19 recovery. IEC work provides the know-how to build a greener, cleaner and more prosperous world. The programmes and initiatives that we are implementing are to ensure that our contribution to society stays relevant”, said Metzger.\nMulti-stakeholder organization\nIEC is member-led and multi-layered, driven by a global community of experts with diverse backgrounds and interacting with a very broad range of stakeholders. These include, but are not limited to, industry, government and regulators, developing countries, international and regional organisations, and academia. This community of stakeholders provides IEC with a unique and varied mix of perspectives, insights and experiences that keeps its work relevant and our impact global.\nDiversity, succession planning and expanding global reach\nMetzger noted that IEC has always recognized that diversity increases relevance. The IEC Diversity Statement underlines the importance of inclusion and stresses stakeholder diversity, gender diversity, and geographical diversity for continued global relevance.\nIEC is developing guidelines and training material to improve the gender balance in technical committees and IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nThe Affiliate Country Programme expands global reach and enables developing and newly industrializing countries to participate in IEC work without the financial burden of membership.\n“Participating countries gain access to IEC International Standards, learn how to set up a national electrotechnical committee, contribute to IEC work and participate in the annual IEC General Meeting and Affiliate Forum. Their insights, experience and knowledge will help to ensure that tomorrow’s standards stay relevant”, said Metzger.\nThe IEC Young Professionals Programme nurtures the next generation of engineers, scientists and technology experts who will continue to provide the world with solutions in the digital era. It allows young managers and engineers chosen by IEC National Committees to help shape the future of international standards and conformity assessment, while benefitting from important networking opportunities in the world of standards.\nDigitalization and addressing societal concerns\nStaying relevant means transforming digitally and developing smart standards and conformity assessment services. The future of the IEC is where the future needs of society and the economy will be.\nThe way standards are developed will change. Future content will move towards Standards as a Service, that will be machine-readable, executable, interpretable and eventually machine controllable. IEC is currently implementing new tools and agile processes to deliver more data-centric standards.\nIn addition to technical challenges, answers must be found for the many social challenges and ethical dilemmas raised by artificial intelligence and other technologies, such as privacy, security and trust for the widest possible benefit.\n“International standards developed by multiple stakeholders ensure the right balance is struck between the desire to deploy artificial intelligence and other new technologies rapidly and the need to study their impact”, said Metzger. “IEC and ISO work together to develop standards in this area, which provide guidelines on managing risk faced by organizations during the development and application of artificial intelligence techniques and systems.”\nIEC and UN SDGs\nThe IEC mission statement – “IEC everywhere for a safer, more efficient world” means supporting the realization of decarbonization and an all-electric society, in order to ensure global prosperity by providing universal access to affordable energy, generated from renewable and sustainable sources. \nIEC standardization and conformity assessment activities contribute to the UN SDGs by playing a fundamental economic role and support global trade.\nIEC promotes the business case for embracing SDGs, which can act as drivers for innovation, opening up new and emerging markets, and creating new opportunities for investment and is mapping its standards against the SDGs.\nMetzger concluded by recognizing the unique contribution of the IEC worldwide community of experts and their ability to develop consensus-based solutions that reflect state-of-the-art best practices. The 20,000 plus engineers, scientists and technology experts around the world contribute to IEC work to ensure that standards provide guidance on implementing best practices in safety, efficiency and trustworthiness.\nAbout SES\nThe Society for Standards Professionals (SES) is a not-for-profit professional membership society dedicated to furthering the knowledge and use of standards and standardization.

        "content": "Olympic cycling teams competing in Tokyo have been using 3D scanners and printers to customize bike parts to the exact requirements of their athletes. The teams use 3D printers to create new bike stems, handlebars and chainsets without the need for expensive tooling or moulds.\nAdditive manufacturing is also being applied in a wide range of other sports. For athletes competing in the upcoming Paralympic Games, for example, 3D printing provides a more efficient way to build lighter and more aerodynamic prostheses and wheelchairs.\nIn the wider world of sport, 3D printers have been used to make everything from running shoes and ski boots to surfboards and parts for racing cars. Professional golf players use customized 3D printed clubs to enhance their performance. \nThey can also be essential when accidents happen. Not so long ago, facial injuries, such as fractured noses or cheekbones, would have meant long periods of inactivity for footballers while their injuries healed. \nNowadays, medical professionals simply scan the face of the injured footballer to create bespoke 3D-printed face masks. There have been several high-profile examples, in recent years, of footballers in some of Europe’s top leagues who have been able to continue playing thanks to their masks.\nInternational standards have played a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, efficiency and safety of 3D printers and the components they use. A number of technical committees and subcommittees contribute to the work.\nISO/IEC JTC 1, the joint technical committee of IEC and ISO, produces international standards for 3D printing and scanning, including foundational standards upon which other standards can be developed. In addition, a number of IEC technical committees and subcommittees work on identifying, developing and coordinating international standards for the electric and electronic components that are installed in the 3D printers being used in additive and subtractive manufacturing processes.\nAmong many other relevant parts and components are switches and relays covered by TC 17: Switchgear and controlgear, TC 121: Switchgear and controlgear and their assemblies for low voltage; servo and stepper motors used to move the extrusion head or the sintering laser by TC 2: Rotating machinery,  and power supplies by TC 96: Transformers, reactors, power supply units, and combinations.\nMost important are the different types of lasers used for sintering metals and polymers. TC 76: Optical radiation safety and laser equipment, is the leading body on laser standardization, including the high-power lasers used in industrial and research applications.

An international standard plays a crucial role in helping the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to catch drug cheats.\nThe WADA-accredited laboratory in Tokyo has been operating around the clock to analyze athlete samples. Because the reputations and careers of the world’s finest athletes hang in the balance it is essential that testing is reliable and that results are internationally comparable.\nISO/IEC 17025, which is developed in the joint IEC and ISO technical committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1), is the international reference for testing and calibration laboratories around the world. It describes the requirements a laboratory must meet to demonstrate that it can generate trustworthy results.\nThe process ensures that a laboratory's quality management system is thoroughly evaluated regularly to guarantee continued technical competence and compliance with the standard.\nISO/IEC 17025 has five sections:\n\nGeneral requirements\n\tLaboratories have to commit to impartiality and confidentiality in their activities.\nStructural requirements\n\tThe laboratory is a legal entity that is legally responsible for its activities. As such, the laboratory must, among other things, identify management that has overall responsibility, define its organizational and management structure, the range of its activities, document its procedures and specify the role of anyone managing, performing or verifying work affecting the results of the laboratory.\nResource requirements\n\tThis section describes key aspects, including all processes and procedures, related to personnel, facilities and environment, equipment, metrological traceability, as well as products and services provided by third parties.\nProcess requirements\n\tProcess requirements address the review of requests, tenders and contracts, the selection, verification and validation of methods, sampling, the handling of tests or calibration items, technical records, the evaluation of measurement uncertainty, ensuring the validity of results, reporting of results, complaints, nonconforming work and the control of data and information management.\nManagement requirements\n\tAn important focus of this section is the risks and opportunities associated with the laboratory activities. Addressing risks can include “identifying and avoiding threats, taking risks to pursue an opportunity, eliminating the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk or retaining risk by informed decision”. Opportunities can “lead to expanding the scope of the laboratory activities, addressing new customers, using new technology and other possibilities to address customer needs”.\n\nISO/IEC 17025 enables laboratories to demonstrate that they are technically proficient and able to produce accurate test and calibration data. Unreliable testing could unfairly damage reputations and open the door to legal challenges."

        "content": "Used to measure physical quantities such as temperature, strain and pressure, fibre optic sensors are an alternative to mechanical and electric sensors. And because of their small size, immunity to electromagnetic interference and resistance to high temperature, fibre optic sensors are finding wide application.\nIn order to measure performance characteristics of fibre optic temperature sensors, the IEC has published a new standard IEC 61757-2-1, Fibre Optic Sensors – Part 2-1: Temperature measurement – Temperature sensors based on fibre Bragg gratings. This standard specifies the terminology, characteristic performance parameters and related test methods of fibre optic temperature sensors based on one of the most sensitive sensor techniques available, fibre Bragg gratings, which can simultaneously measure temperature and strain as a single sensor or as a chain of several multiplexed discrete sensors in a single fibre.\nAccording to Wolfgang Habel, who served as the project leader of IEC 61757-2-1, “This standard provides guidelines to manufacturers of fibre optic temperature sensors for the performance characterization of their products and it also helps the users of these sensors to better understand the performance criteria needed for selection, use and operation of the sensors.”\nIndustrial applications\nA number of industries rely upon fibre optic sensors to monitor the integrity of their infrastructure. Given their immunity to electromagnetic interference and small size, they are often used in areas with high voltage or flammable materials. Examples of their application include the monitoring of facilities in the gas and oil industry and power transmission systems as well as ensuring the integrity of ships, aircrafts and road infrastructure.\nAs Dr Habel notes, “Fibre optic temperature sensors are not only perfect sensors for energy-related applications with high voltage and electromagnetic interference. They can also be used in radiated environments, are immune to microwave energy and - because of their tiny size - can be integrated into filigree structures.”\nGiven that drifts are extremely small with fibre Bragg gratings, these sensors provide an alternative long-term stable measurement technology. “They also feature high accuracy, long-term stability, small dimensions, simple and cost-saving installation, and first-rate performance under harsh environmental conditions,” remarks Dr Habel.\nIEC 61757-2-1 is part of the IEC 61757 series related to fibre optic sensors. It has been prepared by IEC SC 86C, Fibre optic systems and active devices, in cooperation with the German engineering society VDI/VDE."

At the end of the process, it will allow the production of structured content and semantic markup, for product creation and more intelligent use of the content,” said Menzies.\nAgile tool development\nThe tool is being configured and developed and continues to evolve as it is tailored to the needs of standards developers. This is being done in collaboration with user groups and early adopters in IEC and ISO. The working groups use the tool to write content (standards) and give their feedback to the tool developers. A list of features required for standards development continues to be worked on, with regular bug fixes, revisions and new items added if needed.\nTool features that simplify standards drafting\nFeatures for collaborative standards development, which were demonstrated included: inserting formulae, clauses and subclauses, the internal cross-referencing tool, as well as a feature to look up and insert references to external documents, which improve accuracy and save time.\nWhether inserting new elements or moving content around, the autonumbering automatically updates. The tool also includes support for applying the ISO/IEC Directives which guides and simplifies the drafting process.\n“Contrary to working in Word, where there are a lot of formatting options, we have deliberately limited these. We’re trying to come up with intelligent solutions based more on semantics than formatting so that users focus more on the content than formatting it,” said Bielfeld.\nSeveral people can work on the same document at the same time. However, the lock feature ensures that only one person can work on a particular clause at a time, to avoid any mishaps. The commenting feature allows users to see who made a proposal (comment), the type of comment (general, editorial or technical) and whether it has been resolved. Comments can be tagged and sorted using a filter, so that in long documents with many comments, collaborators can quickly find the part they want to work on.\nLooking ahead\nThe tool will eventually be integrated into the IEC Collaboration Platform as well as the project and expert management systems and more developments will come down the line from the suggestions made by users.\n“We already have something which shows a lot of promise and which over the coming year will develop immensely, if we add the notion of history and transparency within the document development cycle. If we integrate this within IEC workflows and the expert management system, we'd be able to know who is allowed to access the document and with what permissions,” said Menzies.\nLater this year, work will start on members commenting, which is a natural extension of the commenting work that has been done so far. This could allow national committee member bodies to collect, make and submit comments reflecting their national position at the balloting stages.\nThe current process for NC commenting is very time consuming for NCs and for the final consolidation process at IEC. “We are currently in discussions with NCs and will continue to do this to see how the tool can make it as easy as possible for NCs to make comments either directly in the tool or by finding a simple way to import the comments into it,” concluded Menzies.\nGetting involved\nThere are currently around eight IEC working groups using the tool, but if other technical committees want to participate, they should contact the OSD project team with their project proposal at authoring@iec.ch.\nCheck out the webinar recording and presentation on the IEC Academy website. A Q&A document, answering all questions by the audience during the webinar, will be uploaded to the same area and conveyed to everyone who registered in the coming week."

        "content": "Countries around the world are trying to curtail the rise in global average temperature by setting ambitious targets to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of their commitment to the Paris Agreement.\nAs part of this global effort, the IEC is working on a new horizontal standard, IEC 63372, which will provide the principles, methodologies and guidance for the quantification and communication of GHG emissions, emission reductions and avoided emissions from electric and electronic (EE) products, services and systems. According to a report published by the European Environmental Bureau, extending the lifetime of all washing machines, smartphones, laptops and vacuum cleaners in the European Union by one year would lead to annual savings of approximately four million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030.\nTakako Hiruta, Convenor of the IEC TC 111 Working Group 17 on Greenhouse gas provides further details about this draft standard.\nWhat is the need for this standard?\nClimate action is urgently required, and organizations need to report and disclose their commitments, plans and results As a result, organizations need an international standard to quantify GHG emissions, emission reductions and avoided emissions using uniform calculation methods so that EE companies can determine the amount of emissions for which they are responsible. We also recognize the risk of greenwashing and, with this standard, can declare that the results are aligned with agreed requirements and the guidance.\nIEC 63372 expands the scope of two existing technical reports, IEC TR 62725 and IEC TR 62726. What are some of the differences?\nIEC TR 62725 was published in 2013 while IEC TR 62726 was issued in 2014 and so much has changed since then. There are three main points to highlight. First, is the change from a technical report to an international standard, which will make it more powerful than the existing publications since a standard includes requirements.\nSecond, the scope has been expanded to include avoided emissions, which calculates the GHG amounts not emitted or avoided, using EE products and systems, whether or not they are digitalized.\nThe final point addresses new digital technologies. Artificial intelligence, IoT and digital twins offer significant potential for emission avoidance. One of the purposes of this international standard is to establish methodologies to assess the avoided emissions using such new technologies.\nHow does this standard compare with others such as the ones developed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, ISO 14067, etc?\nThis standard specifically addresses EE products. While it basically aligns with other standards like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14067, it specifically focuses on GHG emissions, emission reductions and avoided emission by EE products, services and systems. No other standard provides a method to calculate avoided emissions. It is the most in-depth and advanced standard on this topic.\nThe full interview is available on e-tech."

        "published_day": "2021-07-26",
        "abstract": "A brand new safety standard for ships.",
        "content": "IEC is about to issue the first edition of a key standard to protect ships with a non-metallic hull from electro-magnetic (EM) interference, a document which has been designed to meet the requirements of IMO resolution A.813(19).\nIEC 62742 ED1 offers guidance on how to achieve electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC) on ships whose hulls are made from non-metallic material, including various composites like fibre glass. It also can be used by hybrid ships which have a metallic hull but are equipped with a non-metallic superstructure or components. It is an important addition to IEC 60533, which specifies requirements for ships with metallic hulls.\n“Hulls made from composite materials are becoming more widespread, as an increasing number of ship owners opt for lighter vessels. However, unlike metal, default composite materials do not protect electronic equipment from EM interference. IEC 62742 establishes different ways to nevertheless protect essential equipment, for instance transmission cables for radio equipment which are crucial electrical devices on a ship. Screened cables are an option, for example, and the standard plans for that,” explains Jan-Kees van der Ven, who leads the work in IEC Technical Committee 18 on EM standardization for ships.\nScreened cables radiate much less electromagnetic energy, due to the screen’s ability to contain and divert it. Screens may be either in the form of an aluminium foil or a copper braid which is wrapped around the wiring in the cable.\n“One of the interesting developments is that vessels with lighter hulls can be equipped with heavy battery packs, which are essential to augment the electrification process on board. Increased electrification is a way of reducing polluting sources of diesel fuel emissions. While IMO still requires all ships to have a diesel engine, using electricity generated by batteries for  a variety of tasks reduces pollution,” adds van der Ven.\nLooking to the future\nOnce the new standard is published, probably in September, van der Ven’s group of experts will be revising IEC 60533. “This standard has not been majorly updated since 1999. We had a minor revision in 2015 but it needs, in my view, to be totally rewritten as the electrical and electronic environment of ships has drastically changed over the last years. It has become far more complex, as many more electronic devices are used on board such as sensors, LED lights, etc. The idea is also to specify a set of requirements for the ship owner and ship builder to comply to whereas the existing standard is targeted at electrical device manufacturers,” Van der Ven says.\nThe complexity of electronics on board ships is expected to continue increasing, as ships become more autonomous. In the brave new world of automated and electric transport, IEC Standards for shipping have an increasingly important role to play.\n Find out more and read the full article in e-tech."

        "content": "From 1 September, the European Union will require that all EU-flag vessels conform to new bridge alert management (BAM) system testing standards. As per the EU Marine Equipment Directive (MED), all new vessels as well as those undergoing retrofitting will need to certify that their bridge systems are in conformity with two IEC standards – IEC 62923-1 and IEC 62923-2.\nIn 2018, the IEC published these two standards to allow testing for compliance with Resolution MSC.302(87) from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This resolution helps mariners manage and understand alerts with the aim of eliminating unnecessary audible and visual alarm announcements. The BAM system defined by the IMO helps to manage, handle and harmonize the presentation of alerts on the bridge.\nThe IEC Standards not only specify the testing for compliance with the IMO resolution but also provide interface requirements for the BAM equipment. These requirements do not apply to legacy equipment but provision have been made for the requirements to be integrated as possible. \nIt is expected that the United Kingdom will also adopt these requirements for UK-flag vessels.\nIEC Standards for the shipping industry\nTwo IEC technical committees are dedicated to preparing international standards for the maritime industry. In agreement with IMO, IEC TC 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems, has taken on the role of developing international standards for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), an internationally agreed set of safety procedures and communication protocols used to increase safety and make it easier to rescue ships in distress.\nIEC TC 18: Electrical installations of ships and of mobile and fixed offshore units, also cooperates with IMO where electrical systems on board ships are concerned. It publishes international standards in line with the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), an international maritime treaty which sets minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships\nMany other IEC TCs develop international standards which are relevant to the maritime industry and help it plan a greener, safer, more secure and cost-efficient future. The IEC also administers four conformity assessment (CA) systems that certify that components, equipment, installations and systems used in the maritime industry conform to the specifications outlined in its international standards.\nMore information is available in the IEC briefing paper Marine transport."

For instance, trustworthiness, ethics, societal concerns and the quality of data, need to be addressed for digitalization to be successful, whatever the sector.\nOne way to achieve this is through international standards. IEC and ISO, together develop international standards for information and communication technologies in more than 22 areas, including artificial intelligence.\nIn an article written for the Regulatory Focus Quarterly of the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS), Wael William Diab, who Chairs the IEC and ISO committee for AI standardization, explains how the work considers the entire ecosystem. The platform approach taken allows the standards developed to be used with other efforts, such as application domain standards, regulatory and policy requirements, emerging societal concerns and business requirements.\n“The ability to provide insights is at the core of the digital transformation and the emerging applications and services powering it. IT systems and technologies, such as AI and big data, are key enablers. The international standards that SC 42 is developing in this area are crucial to removing barriers to adoption while proactively addressing issues such as ethical concerns,” says Diab.\nRead the full article."

        "abstract": "Learn more about the contribution of Walter Jager and his colleagues in Canada towards IEC standardization work related to the environment.",
        "content": "Walter Jager specializes in finding solutions for environmental compliance and sustainability. He is the principal consultant and founder of ECD Compliance. Walter chaired the Canadian mirror committee for the IEC Technical Committee on Environmental Standardization for Electronics (IEC TC 111) from 2005 until 2020.\nHow can industry leaders leverage standards to advance sustainability and grow the circular economy?\nBy actually using the standards, they can harmonize requirements that will assist with business advancement. The key element here is achieving the circularity of materials so we don’t have to keep using new materials. This will decrease emissions and waste. To do this, we need to use less hazardous materials by incorporating the three Rs: reducing is best, reusing second, and recycling third. There are several standards that help track and gather information to find ways to recycle hazardous materials. Companies can use this information to lessen their impact and promote a circular economy.\nIEC TC 111 also has an eco-design standard that outlines how to improve environmental performance of products through design and is working on a guidance document on how to improve material circularity in EEE products. Eco-design needs a systematic approach, especially when trade-offs arise between environmental improvement measures, product safety and product performance. The committee also has a number of standards on how to test for hazardous substances. Harmonized test methods were an early priority for TC 111 given discrepancies in test results between suppliers, customers, and enforcement authorities. Applying these International standards can really help make products more sustainable, and ensure products can be reused, refurbished and remanufactured, recycled etc.\nWhat are some of Canada’s key contributions to advancing the work of IEC TC 111?\nCanada does a lot! We help lead the strategic development of standards that minimize the environmental impacts of technology. These requirements help manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises that don’t have huge purchasing power. For example, by developing supply chain standards that meet environmental requirements, we help companies ensure their products are compliant with international market needs.\nCanada also provides guidance on removing harmful substances from products and calculating recyclability of electrical products, which promotes the circular economy. Canada has a strong participation in IEC’s advisory group on environmental standardization strategy and influence in driving environmental performance through harmonized standards.\nWe also promote the marketing of environmental standards and their benefits. For example, I maintain a blog on the international standard for Material declaration for products of and for the electrotechnical industry (IEC 62474). An American colleague and I co-lead the International validation team that regularly updates the IEC 62474 online database of harmful and reportable substances that are relevant to the electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) industry.\nWhat are some of the mirror committee’s top priorities for the next five years?\nThe advisory group is currently developing our strategic plan for the next five years. A big part are the standards around environmental assessment and the standards to assist circular economy. They focus on product durability to increase life span and ability to repair, material efficiency, life cycle assessment (LCA), and measuring carbon footprint of products, emission reductions and avoided emissions. We also have an upcoming project to develop a framework for sustainable management of e-waste, including reuse and recycling.\nThis article originally appeared on the SCC website and is republished with their kind permission.

        "content": "The first-ever IEA market report dedicated to hydropower was published in June. It highlights the economic and policy environment for hydropower development, addresses the challenges it faces, and offers recommendations to accelerate growth and maintain the existing infrastructure.\nThis report presents ten-year capacity and generation forecasts for reservoir, run-of-river and pumped storage projects across the globe, based on bottom-up country and project-level monitoring.\nAccording to the report, in 2020, hydropower supplied 17% of global electricity generation, the third‑largest source after coal and natural gas. Over the last 20 years, hydropower’s total capacity rose 70% globally, but its share of total generation stayed stable due to the growth of wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), coal and natural gas.\nHydropower is also a compelling option to support the rapid deployment and secure integration into electricity systems of solar PV and wind, whose electricity production can vary depending on factors like the weather and the time of day or year. Today, according to the report, hydropower plants account for almost 30% of the world’s capacity for flexible electricity supply.\nIn emerging countries, hydropower has provided a cost-effective way to expand electricity access. In advanced economies, however, the share of hydropower in electricity generation has been declining and plants are ageing.\nIn North America, the average hydropower plant is nearly 50 years old and in Europe 45 years old. These installations must be modernized to ensure they can contribute to electricity security in a sustainable manner for decades to come.\nIEC Technical Committee 4 publishes a wide number of standards pertaining to the safety and performance of hydraulic turbines. Its Chair, Pierre Maruzewski, explains how he perceives the challenges ahead:\n\"It is important to bring facilities that have been around for decades up to date, by replacing parts using the latest technologies: turbines have evolved a lot over recent years and can be adapted to different water flows and function at variable speeds, for instance. Climate change and environmental degradation have resulted in a reduction of water inflow at some hydropower plants, as well as a decrease in reservoir levels.\n\"Some hydropower plants suffer from water head reduction, together with a decrease in efficiency of energy conversion in hydro turbines. Variable speed turbines can be a more energy-efficient solution. Sensors and microprocessors perform better every year thanks to technology innovations.\n\"The aim is to improve the performance of installed facilities and make them more efficient. Automation is becoming increasingly important, together with the use of control commands and control command software.\"\nAmong the many standards published by the TC, the IEC 63132 series provide guidance for installation procedures of hydroelectric machines. These standards are very useful for countries wishing to install new hydro facilities and which have little or no prior knowledge of hydro power. \nThe TC recently published IEC 60545, the second edition of a standard initially published in 1976. The purpose of the document is to establish suitable procedures for commissioning and operation of hydraulic machines and associated equipment.\nTC 4 is also working on bringing a couple of standards up to date: IEC 60609-1 and IEC 60609-2 on cavitation pitting evaluation. It is also preparing a new standard on standardized technical specifications governing the fatigue of hydraulic turbine runners. This standard will be important to ensure hydraulic turbine runners last for as long as possible."

Detecting illicit trafficking of radioactive materials and safeguarding nuclear material. These are a few examples of how we make use of germanium detectors to measure radiation levels.\nTo ensure the performance of these detectors, the IEC has published a new edition of IEC 61452, Nuclear instrumentation – Measurement of activity or emission rate of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides – Calibration and use of germanium-based spectrometers. This standard defines the methods for calibrating and using germanium-based spectrometers that measure photon energies and emission rates as well as calculate radionuclide activities based on these measurements. \nWith this standard, it is possible to have a basis for the routine calibration and use of germanium semiconductor detectors. It provides a unified approach to evaluate their performance characteristics, which ultimately improves the quality and accuracy of the instrumentation systems.\nUnderstanding germanium-based spectrometers\nA gamma-ray spectrometer consists of a germanium detector with its liquid nitrogen or mechanically refrigerated cryostat and preamplifier, associated to analogue or digital electronic modules which include the detector biasing and signal processing (amplification, multichannel conversion and storage) and data-readout devices. In addition, a radiation shield generally surrounds the detector to minimize the possible impact of any background radiation. \nInteraction of the photons (X and gamma-ray) in the germanium crystal impart energy to electrons whose energy is released by the creation of electron-hole pairs. These electrons and holes are collected to produce a pulse whose amplitude is proportional to the energy deposited in the active volume of the germanium crystal. These pulses are amplified, shaped and sorted according to pulse height to produce a histogram showing, as a function of energy, the number of photons absorbed by the detector. After the collection of a sufficient number of pulses, the histogram will display a spectrum with one or more peaks corresponding to photons that transferred their entire energy to the detector. The measurement of the emission rates is used to determine the activities of the radionuclides in the given sample.\nScope of IEC 61452\nTo ensure the proper functioning and calibration of germanium-based spectrometers, IEC 61452 defines the following:\n\n       Performance tests to ensure that spectrometer functions within acceptable limits,\n       Methods for the measurement of and the correction for pulse pile-up,\n       Test to ensure the approximate magnitude of true coincidence summing,\n       Techniques for the inspection of spectral analysis results for large errors resulting from true coincidence summing of cascade gamma rays in the detector.\n\nThe standard also provides suggestions for the establishment of data libraries for radionuclide identification, decay corrections and the conversion of gamma-ray emission rates to decay rates.\nThe previous version of the standard was published in 1995."

These tasks include construction work as well as operation and maintenance of electrical equipment and can comprise autonomous vehicles operating on rails, on the ground, in the air, under water and even on or inside equipment, for unmanned inspection. \nThe initial scope for standardization includes terminology, design, functions and performance, test methods, interfaces between robots and information systems, operation methods and safety and security requirements. In addition, the TC will also be required to provide standards for edge computing as well as analysis of the data acquired by these robots. It will also coordinate its work with other TCs working in standardization for power systems, such as ISO/TC 299, and other IEC TCs which relate to industry specific applications, such as TC 82, TC 88, and TC 114. Robotics for nuclear power systems will not come under its remit."

        "abstract": "The IEC has updated the common charging interoperability solution (IEC 63002, based on the latest UBS technologies). It supports increasing adoption in an even larger number of electronic devices.",
        "content": "After the successful introduction of a common charging solution for mobile smartphones (based on USB technologies), in 2011, the IEC published a common charging interoperability solution in 2016, which went beyond smartphones to also include other electronic devices such as tablets and certain laptops. This solution is now becoming widely available in global markets and realizing the policy goals of e-waste reduction and increased user convenience. \nThe IEC has now issued an update to the common charging interoperability solution(IEC 63002, which is based on the latest UBS technologies) that will support increasing adoption in an even larger number of electronic devices. With it, different product chargers implementing this solution can be used with any electronic device that also implements this solution. The technology is backwards and forwards compatible, safe and supports future innovation ensuring e-waste reduction and long-term user convenience. \nToo much e-waste and lack of convenience\nAccording to a December 2019 study by the Fraunhofer Institute for the European Commission, consumers historically had difficulty identifying the right charger for different electronic devices. Furthermore, because each device had a different charger, once the device was no longer in use, the charger became obsolete and joined others in drawers and cupboards. With evolving USB technologies for charging, these historical issues have already decreased. A further significant reduction of e-waste due to chargers can be forecast for a growing number of different electronic devices.\nCommon charging solution for mobile phones\nIn 2011, the IEC published the IEC 62684 standard (updated in 2018) based on USB technologies (IEC 62680 series of standards) that had been widely adopted for data enabled phones. IEC 62684 is now globally used in data-enabled phones and other devices. It specifies the common charging interoperability requirements of external power supplies (EPS) for use with data-enabled smart mobile phones up to 7.5 Watts. EPS for smartphones built to these standards are widely adopted all over the world. \nHigher power devices = higher safety requirements\nThis success initiated the development of a new set of USB technology-based specifications detailing common charging interoperability requirements for higher power devices. This task was a lot more complex since higher power devices such as laptops, or monitors have stricter requirements for safety, reliability, electromagnetic interference on charging performance, and energy efficiency.\nCommon charging solution for even more and higher-power devices\nTo address these requirements, global experts worked together to develop the latest USB specifications: IEC 62680-1-3 (USB Type C®) and IEC 62680-1-2 (USB Power Delivery) and the common charging interoperability solution now published as IEC 63002:2021*.\n\nBackwards and forwards compatible\nThe IEC 63002 standard is fully backwards compatible with IEC 62684. It extends the benefits of common charging interoperability to tablets, notebooks and a wide range of devices up to 100 Watts and more.  Among other things, it provides interoperability and technical guidelines and specifications for cables, connectors, adapters, as well as for data and power delivery protocols.IEC 63002 also specifies minimum baseline requirements for external power supplies (EPS) for interoperability, hardware protection and reliability while recognizing the authority of existing regulatory compliance programmes. \nThe common charging interoperability solution enables three types of charging scenarios: \n\nUsing a charger to charge different devices\n\tThe same charger can be used interchangeably to charge devices from different manufacturers as well as to charge different categories of devices. For example, a tablet charger can be used to charge a camera or a mobile phone.\nUsing a device to charge another device\n\tFor example, a laptop can be used to directly charge a tablet, or a mobile phone can be used to charge an electric toothbrush or shaver.\nDirectly charging devices from an electrical socket or power bank\n\tTablets, laptops or phones can be charged directly via an electrical socket or other external power source (for example USB power sockets on furniture, appliances, etc.). \n\nReducing e-waste \nThe common charging interoperability solution allows consumers to use/re-use their chargers interchangeably with tablets, laptops, displays, phones, e-readers, cameras, and other small electronics, ending the days of drawers filled with old, no longer compatible chargers.\nDevices can be used longer, protecting consumer investments\nA device no longer has to be discarded because the EPS is broken, discontinued, or was lost.  Consumers get longer use of their devices because EPSs based on this common charging solution are forward and backward compatible across different generations of USB technologies. \nA solution that fulfils environmental, convenience and market needs\nGlobal market adoption of IEC 63002, allows:\n\ndesigners to develop EPSs that optimally respond to the needs of new devices in terms of system and charging performance, reliability, and energy efficiency, while enabling them to charge other types of devices from different manufacturers\nmanufacturers to support continuing innovation while ensuring interoperability, quality, and product safety\nconsumers can clearly understand which chargers are optimized for use with each device (based on indicated maximum power) while also being able to use interchangeably, easily and safely the same charger with different devices. Consumers can use their devices longer and contribute to increased environmental sustainability.  \n\nSee also a video that explains the benefits of IEC 63002; co-developed by IEC TC 100 experts and USB-IF.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*IEC 63002 specifies requirements for common charging interoperability of external power supplies (EPSs) used with computing and consumer electronics devices that implement IEC 62680-1-3 (USB Type-C® Cable and Connector Specification) and IEC 62680-1-2 (USB Power Delivery)"

        "content": "When WHBQ Memphis played “That’s all right”, on 7th July 1954, the Memphis-based radio station kickstarted the career of an up-and-coming singer called Elvis Presley. Nowadays, radio airplay continues to be an important measure of success for the music industry. \nIt is extraordinary to consider that Elvis made his radio debut a little over 30 years after the world’s first, regular entertainment station took to the air. The Two Emma Tock station broadcast its first show, from the British town of Writtle, in February 1922.\nIt transmitted only on Tuesday evenings for 30 minutes, on 700m (428 kHz). \nRadio depends entirely on electricity as a source of power for transmission and reception, and on electrical and electronic components for its broadcasting and receiving equipment. No surprise, then, that as early as 1926 the IEC created TC 12: Radiocommunications.\nNow disbanded, it was the first of a number of IEC technical committees subcommittees that continue to develop international standards for the components and systems that make radio. Nowadays, IEC standardization work for radio broadcasting and receiving equipment is carried out by:\n\nTC 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment\nTC 103: Transmitting equipment for radiocommunication\nTC 108: Safety of electronic equipment within the field of audio/video, information technology and communication technology.\n\nRadio reception can be subject to interference from a variety of sources, which include electrical equipment. IEC has been involved in reducing that interference to radio (and later TV) broadcasts, initially in the 150 kHz to 30 MHz frequency range – which includes long-, medium- and short-waves.\nIt does that through its International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR), which was created and first met in 1934.\nThe IEC has been supporting the development of radio receiving and transmitting equipment through its international standards for more than 90 years. It plays playing a major role in the development of a technology that continues to inform and entertain the public."

        "abstract": "Investigators have blamed a criminal gang for a recent ransomware attack that affected businesses in the US and Europe. International standards can protect organizations against cyber-attacks.",
        "content": "Investigators suspect that a criminal gang was behind a recent ransomware attack that affected businesses around the world. The hackers not only encrypted Kaseya customer data but also infiltrated a Kaseya software product used by Managed Service Providers to remotely monitor and administer networks, systems and IT infrastructure.\nThey then used the software to push out malicious code masquerading as a security update to Kaseya’s customers. The attack caused problems for a broad array of businesses, including IT service companies in several countries, Swedish public television and a school in New Zealand.\nThe US cybersecurity agency is probing the attack after it crippled hundreds of American businesses. Meanwhile, President Biden has asked security agencies to launch an international investigation.\nThere has been an explosion in supply chain incidents in recent years, including the SolarWinds attack that breached US federal agencies. International standards provide guidance based on international best practices for protecting organizations against such attacks.\nFor example, the four-part standard ISO/IEC 27036 provides guidance on supplier relationships, including supply chain and cloud service security.\nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. It also advises on designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, as well as for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nIn addition, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nAnother standard in the ISO/IEC 27000 family, the four-part ISO/IEC 27036, provides guidance on information security for supply chain and other third-party relationships.\nCyber physical systems, including the power grid and industrial plants, face a different challenge. Cyber physical systems, such as the power grid, are smart systems that integrate computational components, engineering, networking and physical process.\nUnfortunately, those responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as energy, health, manufacturing, or transport. From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that, unlike business systems, industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nThat is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk. IT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad”.\nFor cyber physical systems, the focus is on protecting the safety, integrity, availability and confidentiality (S-I-A-C) of a diverse range of traffic, ranging from life-critical patient data requiring immediate delivery and response to general administrative data.\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges as well. IEC 62443, is designed to keep cyber physical systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.\nThe industrial cybersecurity programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cybersecurity in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series."

The JPEG Committee launched the initiative in response to trust and security concerns regarding NFTs and the digital assets they rely on.\nNFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought and sold like physical property although they have no tangible form of their own. Any digital objects can be “minted”, or made available on the blockchain as a token, to become an NFT.\nSir Tim Berners-Lee recently sold his original source code for the world-wide-web as an NFT, raising more than $5.4m. It followed the sale of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, for $2m, and a JPEG file by the artist Beeple for an astonishing $69m, in March.\nOther artists have not been so fortunate. Many have been surprised to discover their work in NFTs minted by scammers.\nThe aim of the new JPEG initiative is to gain a deeper understanding of imaging requirements for NFTs. The standardization experts will also look for ways that JPEG standards could help bring security and trust to NFTs, as well as facilitating interoperability in a wide range of applications.\nThese include applications that rely on content represented in JPEG formats in still and animated pictures and 3D. Security and trust in imaging applications is an important focus of JPEG work.\nJTC 1 develops international standards for information technology. The ISO/IEC and ITU Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is part of JTC 1 subcommittee 29, which covers coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information.\nThey are responsible for the popular JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPSearch, JPEG XT and more recently, the JPEG XS, JPEG Systems, JPEG Pleno and JPEG XL families of imaging standards.\nThe JPEG format is the most widely used image format on the internet, with billions of JPEG images produced every day.

        "content": "A digital revolution in underway in healthcare. A new IEC report, Digital healthcare, provides a high-level perspective of how the IEC can contribute to enabling healthcare in the future. It focuses technologies that are essential for achieving digital healthcare in 2030 and identifies current standardization work as well as potential gaps where further work will be necessary.\nThe report examines how developments in technology and the digitalization of data can be used during the four cycles of health - prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery - to improve health and well-being.\nEvaluating requirements based on use-cases\nThe report provides a number of use cases that demonstrate how technology can be used to improve healthcare. They include:\nSmart asthma inhaler>\nConnected and smart medical devices combined with therapeutic drugs provide numerous benefits to patient care. Taking the smart asthma inhaler as an example, the patient can be monitored and reminded about the correct use of the medication.\nWorkplace environment management\nSensors, cameras and microphones are used to monitor the workplace environment and measure such data as room temperature and humidity as well as the biometric information of those present. The information can be analysed in order to increase the comfort of those in the room.\nPersonal health management\nBy monitoring various data points collected through smart monitoring devices and then analysing the data using AI, it is possible to generate suggestions for a healthy lifestyle in areas such as diet and exercise.\nTelemedicine\nTelemedicine can be defined as the use of ICT to provide patient access to care and medical information. Immersive technologies for care delivery, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), could be adopted for medical use at home.\nDigital imaging AI\nBy using data and AI for radiology and imaging services, hospitals can deliver early diagnosis targeted treatments.\nMicrorobots / nanorobot swarms\nThe miniaturization of robots allows intervention and treatment at the anatomic level. Nanorobots will enable surgery from within the body and tissue repair at the cell level.\nRole of standards\nStandards have an important role to play in providing the necessary infrastructure for establishing new and innovative markets. Based on the use cases outlined above, the report identifies five key technologies - sensing, secure communications, health informatics, AI, and robotics – and how they are addressed by standardization. Perceived gaps in current standards are also identified and recommendations made for addressing this gap.\nA successful standardization framework will also take into consideration the changes underway in the healthcare system, from the reliance on preventive measures to the access of services in non-traditional healthcare environments such as homes and workplaces.\nWith massive transformation anticipated in healthcare through digitalization, standards have the potential to ensure the performance, interoperability and safety of these technologies.\nThis Societal and technology trend report was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB)."

        "content": "Jointly organized by the IEC Systems Committee on Smart cities and ISO /IEC Joint Committee 1 /SC 41 on the Internet of Things and digital twin and hosted by the IEC Academy, the virtual forum, Conversation between City Information Modelling and Urban Digital Twins, helped to better understand the concepts of urban digital twins and city information modelling as well as explored areas where further standardization work is needed.\nThe forum was chaired by Chunlan Guo from IEC SyC Smart Cities with support from Michael Mulquin, Chair of IEC SyC Smart Cities and François Coallier, Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41.\nUnderstanding the concepts\nCity information modelling (CIM) and urban digital twins are two concepts used to help city planners develop smart cities. Given the complexity of city planning and the need to address sustainability, data and scientific knowledge are used to help design resilient, safe and liveable cities.\nCIM is defined as the practice of using interactive digital technologies as part of the process of urban planning. The concept emerged as an evolution of building information modelling (BIM) which uses technology to generate a digital representation of a building. It requires the collection, analysis and visualization of data in order to be able to make informed decisions. This model also requires an increased digitalization of urban design and the planning process.\nUrban digital twins combine 3D city models with the dynamic data gathered using sensors and geospatial technologies to help us better understand our cities. It is based upon the concept of verisimilitude to develop a static structure with dynamic properties. The origins of the technology are to be found in manufacturing.\nAccording to Joshua Lieberman, from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and one of the speakers at the forum, urban digital twins should be described as triplets, given that they must address the digital, physical and social dimensions that co-exist within the city. He also emphasized the necessity of developing small digital twins dealing with just one aspect important to city life, for instance water or energy and then harmonizing the geospatial information to build a 3D city model.\nChallenges ahead\nFor the concepts of city information modelling and urban digital twins to move ahead, several key challenges will need to be addressed. Many of these were alluded to during the presentation of several use cases of CIMs and digital twins, from Australia, the UK and China. Some of these main challenges include:\n\nFocusing on the needs of the users. What do you want to achieve with the technology?\nIntegrating technologies and different approaches (in some cases data is only in a paper format!)\nDefining data rights and ownership (privacy and cyber security)\nMonitoring and setting benchmarks for data quality (rubbish in/rubbish out quandary)\nRegulatory structures given the use of artificial intelligence and the emergence of new business models\n\n\nHow standards can help\nStandardization work is essential to ensure that data can freely circulate between the various systems that comprise a city. Interoperability between software interfaces, benchmarks for data quality, cloud computing, privacy protection are all areas where International Standards can play a useful part.\nIEC and ISO have both started work in different areas that can be relevant. Standards include ISO/IEC 30182, Smart city concept model - Guidance for establishing a model for data interoperability and ISO/IEC 19941, Information technology — Cloud computing — Interoperability and portability.\nThe IEC SyC Smart cities is currently in the process of collecting and analyzing use cases of city CIMs and digital twins to identify the requirements for electrotechnical standards and to ensure that the infrastructure complies with the requirements that will allow for information sharing. The standard, IEC 63273, is expected to be published in 2022.\nMore information\nThe two sessions took place on 22-23 June. Recordings and presentations will be available  soon on the IEC Academy website."

        "content": "The G20 international forum brings together the world’s major economies. This year Italy holds the Presidency and will centre on three broad, interconnected pillars of action: people, planet, prosperity.\nWith events planned throughout 2021, the two-day multistakeholder Forum on Digital Transformation in Production for Sustainable Growth got underway. Topics included new business models to increase market access and strengthen innovative ecosystems, digitalization and new business models and supporting innovative ecosystems. Participants came from academia, industry, government, standardization and society.\nThe key role of international standards\nThe panel for Supporting innovative ecosystems was moderated by Marco Taisch, Professor, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and examined how digitalization of production enables new business models, and the role these can play to increase and broaden market access.\nGabriela Ehrlich, Director of Communications at IEC, discussed the role of international standards developed by IEC, ISO and ITU, which underpin big societal topics such as energy efficiency, sustainability, smart cities, circular economy and cyber security.\n“International standards together with testing and certification are an excellent supporting tool for innovative ecosystems, because they provide a clear framework for innovation in a wide range of areas, including the industrial internet of things, AI, 3D printing, cloud and edge computing, big data and data security and many other information technologies.”\nWhile organizations can be competitive, they also need to collaborate more than ever before, to deliver the broad and interoperable solutions for increasingly complex systems.\n“International standards enable this cooperation, providing the globally harmonized basic rules that allow companies, countries of all sizes and development levels to provide their contribution to common solutions,” noted Ehrlich.\nInstilling confidence through best practices\nBy using standards, innovators can measure the value of their innovation and compare it with other available solutions and know in advance what is needed to connect their product to existing infrastructure.\nFor instance, in the case of wind energy, the whole industry uses standards to rate the performance of a wind turbine, how to measure wind speed, the resilience of blades and abrasion rates.\n“The relevant international standards which comprise best practices are used by manufacturers, testing laboratories, regulators, investors, insurers, etc. to manage expectations and control risks,” said Ehrlich.\nMore about international standards\nThe IEC, ISO and ITU are the only organizations to publish global, voluntary, consensus-based international standards, developed by thousands of experts from industry, academia, governments, NGOs and consumer associations.\nIEC, ISO and ITU International Standards comply with the six WTO technical barriers to trade (TBT) principles of transparency, openness, impartiality and consensus, effectiveness and relevance, coherence, and inclusiveness of developing countries. They are used as the basis for testing and certification and often referred to in national or regional regulations."

        "abstract": "An IEC and ISO survey on gender responsive standards development sent to TCs highlights a lack of awareness of and will to tackle the problem.",
        "content": "It is increasingly acknowledged that standards are largely made by men for men. Women are under-represented in technical committees and very few of them have become Chairs. The increasing awareness that standards are not gender neutral is backed up by studies and reports.\nIn 2020, for instance, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC)  issued a very detailed report on how standards affect gender, particularly when it comes to safety issues. According to the report, When one size does not protect all: understanding why gender matters for standardization, standards often fail to protect women as well as men, leading to unintentional fatalities.\nIn 2019, both IEC and ISO agreed to improve the situation by taking part in the joined the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Declaration for Gender Responsive Standards and Standards Development. Signatories committed to, among other things, “acknowledge that representation of women in standards development is almost always below parity and that the outcomes for men and women are not explicitly addressed during the standards development process.” They also committed to taking action to ensure that standards are gender responsive.\nIn 2020, IEC and ISO partnered under the stewardship of the Joint Strategic Advisory Group (JSAG) to develop guidance to help technical committees ensure they are developing gender-responsive standards. As part of these efforts, JSAG conducted the first ever industry questionnaire on gender-responsive standards development among IEC and ISO technical committees and subcommittees.\nPerspectives were gathered from 356 respondents (50% IEC, 50% ISO). The committees covered a range of sectors, from the more traditional technical industries to the service-orientated ones.  \nDisappointing results\nThe overall results of the questionnaire unearthed the lack of gender responsiveness in standards development and showed that a lot of work remains to be done for standards to fully address the gender issue. \nAccording to the results, 25 % of respondents indicated that gender had been considered in the work of their committee. But even among these, very few have included sex-specific requirements in standards (13%). \nFor committees which have not considered gender, the majority believe it was not relevant to their sector (79%). Respondents also noted that committee members have not raised the topic (50%).  A recurring viewpoint in the comments received was that technical standards “are gender neutral”.\nThe questionnaire also asked whether guidance on how to develop gender-responsive standards would be beneficial. Perhaps not surprisingly, results varied depending on whether the committee had already included gender in its work. Only 31% of committees who had not previously considered gender wanted guidance, compared to 61% of those who had considered gender previously. \nWith a mission to make a measurable positive impact on gender across the international standards world, IEC and ISO will continue to collect data on gender in standardization work. This will help establish a baseline and better understand the scale of the challenges, with a view to improving gender responsiveness in future standards development."

        "content": "Cyber security was high on the agenda at the recent summit talks between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland. The two leaders agreed to begin cyber security talks.\nAnalysts believe that nation states are turning increasingly to cyber warfare to achieve political, economic and military goals. Not only are cyber-attacks highly cost-effective but also it can be almost impossible to identify the perpetrators, which means cyber-attacks are less likely to trigger military retaliation.\nIn recent years, targets have included government agencies and critical infrastructure. In 2020, a major cyber-attack targeted US federal agencies. The incident was widely reported as one of the worst cyber-espionage incidents ever suffered by the US.\nProbably the best-known cyber-attack on critical infrastructure was in Ukraine, in 2015, when hackers left nearly a quarter of a million people without electricity, in the middle of winter, for up to six hours.\nMany analysts believe the notorious Stuxnet worm was also the work of a nation state. The worm targets critical infrastructure, such as power stations, water plants and industrial units.\nOf course, nation states are not the only cyber threat actors. Here are five of the most common.\n1. Employees\nEmployees are the common factor linking most security breaches, which sometimes are deliberately malicious, but more often than not are down to carelessness. Every day, an office worker somewhere in the world clicks on a link in an unsolicited email and falls victim to a phishing attack.\n“People going about their normal operational duties are the biggest threat,” says IEC cyber security expert Frances Cleveland. “It’s important to realize that even when you have cyber security implemented and training, you still have to worry about the insider and in particular, the disgruntled employee. \n“She or he has knowledge of the company, passwords and critical power system processes.”\n2. Lone hackers\nLone hackers often view cyber security as a game. They have been regularly depicted in movies since 1983’s Wargames, in which a teenage computer buff almost triggers a nuclear conflict.\n3. Hacktivists\nHacktivists groups such as Anonymous are driven by social, political or religious beliefs. Government agencies around the world have been targeted by hacktivist attacks to inflict damage or cause embarrassment, rather than to steal data.\n4. Petty criminals\nPetty criminals specialize in relatively low-risk crimes, such as stealing passwords. Others develop malware to sell to criminal gangs. In 2019, British police arrested a teenager for hacking the cloud accounts of some of the world’s best-known artists to steal and sell their songs.\n5. Organized criminals\nOrganized criminals often have the resources and expertise to undermine even the most advanced cyber security systems. According to the United Nations, cyber gangs are behind a large number of crimes, such as ransomware attacks, that cause financial, psychological, economic and even physical harm.\nInternational standards\nUsing ISO/IEC 27001, helps organizations to manage their information security risks. It covers threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nIEC 62443 was initially developed for the industrial process sector but is being used in an ever-expanding range of domains and industries. Users include power utilities, the healthcare sector and the transport industry. The standard provides guidance on implementing a cyber security management framework for cyber-physical systems featuring both IT and OT (operational technology).\nThe IECQ AP scheme tests and provides certification that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met. The IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme does the same for standards within the IEC 62443 series."

        "content": "The latest REN 21 Renewables Global Status Report, which paints a worldwide picture of how renewable energies (REs) were produced and consumed in 2020, has been published. IEC, which is one of the report’s partnering organizations, summarizes a few of its key findings.\nGlobal CO2 emissions dropped in 2020 as a result of COVD-19\nAs governments worldwide instituted lockdowns in 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19, economies slumped and energy consumption plummeted. Overall, primary energy demand worldwide fell around 4% during the year, resulting in a 5,8% drop in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions – the largest percentage decrease since World War II.\nRenewable power capacity grew more than ever before\nInstalled renewable power capacity grew by more than 256 gigawatts (GW) during the pandemic, the largest increase ever. Net additions of renewable power generation capacity outpaced net installations of both fossil fuel and nuclear power capacity combined. \nChina led the world in renewable capacity added, accounting for nearly half of all installations in 2020 and leading the global markets for concentrating solar thermal power, hydropower, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy and wind power. China added nearly 117 GW, bringing online more renewable capacity in 2020 than the entire world did in 2013 and almost doubling its additions from 2019. \nRE reached a record share – an estimated 29% – of the global electricity mix. Below, a summary of some of the results for the three most important sources of RE, hydro, solar PV and wind. According to the report, cheaper renewable energies such as solar and wind were less impacted by the pandemic than more expensive renewables such as hydro or geothermal.\nYou can find figures for other REs, such as marine, concentrated solar thermal or geothermal energy in the report.\nPandemic disrupted hydropower\nDespite a 24% increase in capacity additions, driven mainly by China, the global hydropower market was strongly impacted by COVID-19. The market slowed as construction was halted temporarily, component supply chains were disrupted and energy demand fell. New capacity reached an estimated 19,4 GW, raising the total global installed capacity to around 1,170 GW. Global hydropower generation increased 1,5% in 2020, representing around 16.8% of the world’s total electricity generation. It remains the biggest source of RE worldwide but its increase year on year is slowing down.\nSolar rooftop installations soared \nBy the end of 2020, at least 15 countries had enough capacity in operation to meet 5% or more of their electricity demand with solar PV. The renewable accounted for around 11,2% of annual power generation in Honduras. PV share of power generation was also high in Germany (10,5%), Greece (10,4%), Australia (9,9%), Chile (9,8%), Italy (9,4%) and Japan (8,5%). Spain and the UK broke solar generation records early in the year, due largely to new capacity as well as to higher output resulting from clearer air during COVID lockdowns; clearer skies during lockdowns also enabled nearly 10% more sunlight to reach solar panels in Delhi and contributed to increased output in the United Arab Emirates. However, smoke from wildfires in Australia and the US state of California had the reverse effect on output, while also negatively affecting solar variability and forecasting. But the fires also affected thousands of kilometres of transmission and distribution lines, which drove interest in – and policies supporting – micro grids and stand-alone power systems, particularly solar PV, in remote and rural areas. Australia, for instance, added an estimated 4.1 GW of solar PV capacity in 2020 for a total exceeding 20.4 GW. Despite the impacts of fires on solar output across much of the country, solar PV generation rose more than 24%, with small-scale rooftop systems accounting for 6.5% of total generation.\nRecord year for wind energy\nThe wind power market achieved a record-breaking 93 GW of new installations, bringing total capacity onshore and offshore to nearly 743 GW. For the first time, global capital expenditures committed to offshore wind power during the year surpassed investments in offshore oil and gas.\nIn 2020, wind energy generated enough to provide an estimated 15% of the annual electricity consumption in the EU and much higher shares in at least five individual Member States. Wind energy met an estimated 48% of Denmark’s electricity demand in 2020 and accounted for nearly 58,6% of the country’s total generation. Other European countries with wind generation shares of at least 20% for the year included Ireland (38%), the UK (24,2%), Portugal (24%), Germany (23,2%) and Spain (21,9%). Uruguay (40,4%) and Nicaragua (27,6%) also achieved high shares of generation from wind energy, Globally, wind power capacity in operation accounted for an estimated more than 6% of total electricity generation in 2020. \nImportant challenges ahead\nDespite these advances, renewable electricity continues to face challenges in achieving a larger share of global electricity generation, due in part to persistent investment in fossil fuel (and nuclear) power capacity. Inadequate innovation in some sectors, the need for infrastructure development, the lack of affordability in some markets and the absence of sufficient policy and enforcement also play a part, according to the report."

        "content": "In nearly all industries, digital transformation is becoming a reality. Technologies such as cloud computing, Industrial Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are driving new levels of automation. Industry has embraced the shift to an all-digital environment and the convergence between IT (information technology) and OT (operational technologies). COVID-19 has further driven the digital transition as businesses increased their technology investments and accelerated their use of digital technologies.\nWithin the IEC, many technical committees have addressed the digital transformation in their industry by introducing communication technologies and communication architectures into their activities. To help lead such activities within the IEC, a new systems committee, SyC COMM, was set up in 2020.\nAccording to Yun Chao Hu, Chair of SyC COMM, the new systems committee will provide a holistic view of communication technologies and architectures requirements on behalf of the IEC. He notes, “We would like to help understand the different requirements of the technical committee and help make them more visible to external standardization development organizations (SDOs). We also will look into and forecast new communication technologies that are coming up.”\nBy adopting a systems approach, it will be possible for SyC COMM to coalesce the requirements of the technical committees and provide guidelines on the use of communication technologies. As Hu remarks, “It is important to retrieve comments and feedback from the different technical committees. A systems committee does not provide a one directional perspective but rather has a bi-directional dimension in communication technologies for different domains.”\nPromoting IEC expertise\nETSI, IETF, IEEE, 3GPP are just a few of the many organizations developing specifications in the field of communication technologies and architecture. SyC COMM has been mandated to liaise with the consortia, alliances, fora and SDOs active in this area. According to Patrick Wetterwald, Vice Chair of SyC COMM, “We have an important role in reaching out to external organizations involved in communication technologies. We need to establish liaisons between SDOs and the IEC TCs/SCs to ensure that IEC experts are informed of the latest evolutions in technology.”\nOutreach will be a key task. According to Hu, “Our ambition is to work with almost everybody involved in communication technologies. However, we need to be clear about our messaging towards these organizations and ensure that we are targeting organizations at the global and regional levels.”\nNext steps\nSyC COMM has set up three working groups to address the areas of communication technologies, test beds and application domains. However, as Wetterwald notes, “Communication technologies are in constant evolution. We need to have regular updates of reports on market trends, technologies and spectrum.”\nAs a first step, SyC COMM plans to produce deliverables on market and technology trends as well as on standards mapping. Hu remarks, “It is important to realize that the lifecycle is much shorter now for the different communication technologies. Therefore, it is quite important that we keep deliverables up to date so that the IEC community is aware of the latest perspectives.”\nThe full interview is available on e-tech."

They came in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when hospitals around the world were struggling to cope with the dramatic rise in patients.\nThere are no signs of any let-up in the attacks in 2021.\nThe growth of connected medical devices in hospitals has complicated cyber security by accelerating the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT). The challenge is that, unlike business systems, hospital networks are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nIn an IT environment, a cyber security strategy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems (CIA). In hospitals, the convergence of IT and OT technologies places the focus is on protecting the safety, integrity, availability and confidentiality (SIAC) of a diverse range of traffic.\nHospitals and other critical systems place a much greater emphasis on availability. The easiest way to understand this is by considering what happens in the event of an attack.\nFor IT-led organizations, one of the first lines of defence is shutting the entire system down. In hospitals, however, life-saving medical devices must be able to run permanently to ensure patient safety. In addition, medical devices need to be able to communicate freely throughout the hospital.\nThe same is also true for other essential services, such as pharmacies and nursing stations. Shutting down is just not an option.\nUnfortunately, the emphasis on maintaining an open network, with the ability to provide a quick response to the medical needs of patients, makes hospitals relatively easy targets for cybercriminals. \nA recent IEC Technical Report (IEC TR 60601-4-5:2021) provides detailed guidance on adapting IEC 62443 to the specific needs of the healthcare sector. IEC 62443 was originally developed for the industrial process sector but is now used in all cyber physical environments.\nIEC TR 60601-4-5 provides security specifications for medical electrical equipment and systems connected to hospital IT networks. These include the seven foundational requirements set out in IEC TS 62443‑1‑1: identification and authentication control; use control; system integrity; data confidentiality; restricted data flow: timely response to events; and resource availability.\nThe report defines four security levels and the technical capabilities that a device requires to reach a specific level. It specifically references the security level requirements for components of an IT network set out in IEC 62443‑4‑2, which is required reading for anyone using the report.\nOther key standards included in the report are IEC 60601-1 and IEC 80001. The former covers general requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of medical devices, while the latter deals with the application of risk management for hospital networks incorporating medical devices.\nAbove all, IEC TR 60601-4-5 underlines the importance of medical device manufacturers and operators sharing responsibility for security."

        "content": "Since its launch in 2001, the IEC Affiliate Country Programme (ACP) provides developing and newly industrialized countries with the opportunity to participate actively in the international standardization and conformity assessment activities of the IEC. Earlier this year, the Affiliate secretariat asked affiliate countries to respond to an online survey in order to better understand the impact of the programme and how it can be improved.\nAccording to Aristea Kyriakati, Head of Affiliate Countries and Membership Programmes at the IEC, “We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Affiliate Country Programme this year. With this milestone, we felt that it was the right time to launch a survey that allows us to know how the programme addresses the needs of participants and how it can remain relevant.” \nACP benefits…and challenges\nThe survey results showed that affiliate countries appreciate all the benefits of the programme with specific mention made of the access to the freely available IEC publications, the networking opportunities and the IEC Mentoring Programme. As Kyriakati notes, “We should anticipate increased interest in the mentoring programme which may result to more fruitful mentoring partnerships in the near future.”\nIn addition, 77% of the survey respondents rated the conformity assessment programme for affiliate countries to be a very important benefit of the programme. However, while interest is high, the survey also showed that 50% of respondents need guidance. According to Kyriakati, “Affiliates show a profound interest in accepting certificates; however, they lack competencies in the implementation. This is an area where we can provide further support through the Affiliate Conformity Assessment status (ACAS).”\nIn the survey, respondents noted the need to prioritize the stakeholder engagement to reinforce their standardization infrastructure and remain relevant. They identified that their foremost challenges are the consequence of limited stakeholder representation. “Providing guidance on how to attract stakeholders is another important area to address for affiliate countries,” remarks Kyriakati.\nTopics for further exploration\nIn the survey, respondents provided topics for further training. The most popular were product certification, energy (energy efficiency, energy management, clean energy) and conformity assessment.\nThe respondents also indicate a willingness to contribute to the IEC efforts to achieve the UN SDGs. They indicated an interest in SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), SDG4 (quality education) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).\nAs a next step, the ACP will use the survey to explore new ways to address the needs of affiliate countries. “This survey was a great opportunity to listen to the affiliates and find out what works well for them and what we can improve in the programme, “ concludes Kyriakati.\nFor further information, please contact the Affiliate secretariat at affiliates@iec.ch."

        "abstract": "Using a futures approach, the website presents three possible scenarios to better understand how mobility could evolve.",
        "content": "Access the website here\nThe IEC has launched a new interactive website to explore the topic of mobility. Using a futures approach, the website presents three possible scenarios to better understand how mobility could evolve when considered alongside sustainability and society.\nAccording to Maurizio Bragagni who led the project on behalf of the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB), “We have developed an interactive report that helps to explore the complexities of mobility and generate a conversation within the IEC community and beyond. Using futures and horizon scanning techniques, the report imagines different scenarios that can be used to engage with users and nudge the world towards a better future.”\nAdopting a futures approach\nFuture studies is a relatively new approach to help understand and harness the future. It provides a framework for imagining future scenarios by examining recurring patterns in data from a holistic perspective. These scenarios can be used to inform strategies that seek to resolve complex challenges.\nThe Lean mobility website presents three future scenarios based on numerous interviews with experts in the field of mobility from around the world. These are explored through different drivers - authority, people and technology - to better understand how we can improve mobility while also considering the issues of time, energy usage and sustainability.\n\nFor example, the scenario focusing on technology as the key driver presents an initially bleak world due to a climate emergency and restricted mobility options. However, innovations grow to provide new mobility solutions. These solutions could offer environmentally friendly transport as well as enhanced personal experiences and social interactions using technologies such as artificial intelligence.\nAccording to Daniel Barlow, part of the international team working on the project and Head of Innovation Policy at BSI, “With this project we are not trying to predict or forecast exactly what is going to happen. Rather, it is about considering different scenarios, how they may play out and then looking at our own strategy and ensuring that it is resilient.”\nStarting a conversation\nEach of the three scenarios concludes with questions to the users who are asked to think about the future in terms of expectations, wishes and readiness. Space is provided to offer suggestions to the IEC on how it can tackle these scenarios.\nBarlow notes that “We really wanted to try and open a conversation not only with consumer groups and experts, as is already the case, but to also bring citizens into this conversation.”\nBy providing an interactive element, the project hopes to engage a wider audience that may not have normally participated in IEC activities. As Barlow remarks, “The report is a new format for the IEC. We really wanted to try something different with this project; more engaging, immersive and ‘human’ that could appeal to those not traditionally involved in standardization.”\nNext steps\nWhen considering the issue of mobility, the members of MSB wanted to explore the topic beyond the narrow confines of transport. They sought to explore the mobility alongside challenges such as climate change and equity in a post-COVID environment. \nAs Bragagni notes, “If we do not begin to think radically about the challenges we face and how standards can help bring solutions, we risk becoming irrelevant. We need to show the world and our members that the IEC is contemplating the future and, through our standards, we can establish consensus among a diverse set of stakeholders for collective innovation and action.”"

        "content": "The United Nations organizes World Oceans Day on June 8 to draw attention to the impact of human actions on the world’s seas. The UN is using this year’s World Oceans Day to launch a decade of challenges to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 14, “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources”, by 2030.\nUN Sustainable Development Goal 14 aims to “significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, including from land-based activities, and nutrient pollution”.  At least 11 IEC Technical Committees/Subcommittees and one IEC Conformity Assessment System contribute to the goal.\nCoastal waters receive a variety of land-based pollutants, among them untreated sewage. This is a problem for the ecosystem and human health indirectly, through the consumption of fish and seafood as well as directly through skin contact. \nAmong the three major sources of nutrient pollution are emissions from combustion. Ships burning heavy crude oil, as well as off-shore oil and gas operations can cause offshore marine pollution through ocean-based dumping. \nOften ship motors continue to run in ports to generate electricity for berthing, loading and unloading. Electrification can significantly reduce marine pollution. \nA move from combustion engines to electric motors in agriculture, industry and transportation can significantly reduce nutrient pollution. Electrification of shipping at sea and when anchored in harbours, during loading and unloading of goods can significantly contribute to reducing pollution in ports and the open sea. \nEnsuring the proper functioning and safety of all activities and devices on offshore platforms and during oil drilling through testing and certification can help avoid spills that can deeply affect marine life and coastal areas. Water treatment plants can significantly reduce marine pollution through raw sewage.

In close collaboration with the Standardization Division, the IEC Academy organized the first online training for officers of IEC Technical, Project and Systems Committees as well as Subcommittees.  General Secretary and CEO Philippe Metzger opened the meeting on Monday thanking participants for their commitment: “Our technical committees and subcommittees are essential to ensure that standardization continues to deliver this level of quality and you, as committee officers are driving this. It is your commitment, your excellence and leadership which drive standardization projects, as well as ensuring inclusiveness, transparency and consensus at a global level.”\n60 participants from 35 different committees and 15 countries participated in this 3-day intensive training, which started on June 1 and finished on June 4. The following topics were covered:\n\nIEC Organization\nTC/SC Officers Role\nPlenary Meetings\nStandards Development\nProject Dashboard\nIEC Collaboration Platform\nDocument drafting & editing\nIEC Academy training portfolio\nIEC Communications \nTerminology and the IEV\n\nThe sessions were followed by an Online Tools Workshop where participants could ask specific questions, enabling remaining queries to be answered. “We are dedicated to delivering quality training and capacity building events to the IEC community. It was the first time we organized the event completely online. I was impressed by the team spirit and enthusiasm that resulted from working together with the Standardization Division,” said Jan-Henrik Tiedemann, Head of IEC Academy & Capacity Building\nAll lectures have been recorded and will be made available to participants together with the slides and a Q&A document which contains all questions asked during the training together with the answers. After this first event, more online committee officers training sessions will be organized in other time zones so that a maximum of chairs, secretaries, convenors and project leaders can participate – either to be trained in their new position or use these sessions as refreshers. Committee officers can contact their IEC Technical Officers to be registered for these training events. \n Beside this, the IEC Academy is organizing many more capacity building and training events.

        "content": "“The online standards development (OSD) programme is another important collaboration between IEC and ISO, which will eventually include participation from tens of thousands of experts worldwide who produce standards for both organizations”, said Anja Bielfeld, IT Business Analyst at IEC.\nIEC and ISO presented their latest initiatives during the recent TYPEFI Standards Symposium, in which leading experts from standards development organizations and XML software developers discussed best practices and the latest tools for publishing standards.\nAt the heart of the OSD programme is a Fonto XML tool for drafting standards, which IEC and ISO are integrating into their standards development process. The tool can be configured to specific needs, which includes implementing the rules of both organizations to support experts throughout the standards drafting process. It allows single source publishing and opens up new possibilities for products and services.\n“We’re trying to facilitate the work of our experts who give their free time to develop standards and for our National Committee members who participate at various stages of standards development by commenting and voting on the standards. We hope to facilitate this by offering this online platform”, said Bielfeld.\nBenefits of modular content\nIn addition to regular standards, IEC is developing database standards that are more granular and modular. It has already produced web applications for online creation and lifecycle management of structured content, based on databases.\nThe content is stored in a structured way in the database and a workflow management system allows the creation, validation of content in small pieces, such as: the IEV for terminology, databases with graphical symbols, the component data dictionary.\n“This content can be managed piece by piece, created and updated when required, so that standards developers have the latest information at their fingertips. It also makes navigation and advanced searches easier for the standards users”, said Bielfeld.\nFocusing on machine readability\nAs the standards world moves towards digital-centric business practices, there are new possibilities for products and services with a focus on machine readability. An ISO report released in 2020 has identified a user and market need for data centric standards, particularly for technical industries such as aerospace, engineering, energy and construction.\n“This concept of machine readability would affect standards development from drafting through to distribution. The report cites ISO SMART (Standard that is machine applicable, readable and transferable) for the formats and concepts that would fall under machine readable standards. It’s really key that standards development bodies provide these formats, as the demand is there and technical committees are already working on products, methodologies and datasets”, said Kylie Rodier, Digital Publishing Manager at ISO Central Secretariat.\nMachine readability considers many aspects, for instance: stakeholders, cyber security, formats, infrastructure, drafting practice and tools, commercial viability, distribution and more. In terms of standards, users and industry practice must guide decision making.\nNew possibilities for standards development\nAll these initiatives offer opportunities for SDOs to support their users in the consultation of standards and new tools will facilitate new formats.\n“At IEC, a growing use of commented Red Line versions of standards show the content that has changed between editions, and importantly why it has changed, because all the comments made during the standard’s elaboration can be tracked and used at the publication stage”, said Bielfeld.\nThe XML source allows publishing in multiple formats and platforms. The nature of XML modular categories in databases enables the extraction of semantic categories for different requirements. For example, if users want terminology only from a series of standards, it can be extracted. Another example would be the ability to enhance usability for customers through dynamic cross-references between different standards.\nFind out more about Online Standards Development at IEC."

        "content": "The development of fingerprinting is credited to the British doctor and scientist, Henry Faulds, who was born on 1 June 1843. When Faulds took the idea of fingerprinting to Scotland Yard, in 1886, the British police dismissed the idea.\nBy the time of his death, in 1930, law enforcement agencies around the world recognized fingerprinting as a reliable means of identifying people. Others had used Faulds’s work to place fingerprinting on a scientific basis, but he received no credit during his lifetime. \nNowadays, fingerprints and other biometrics are found in all areas of life. Fingerprints have become a quick way to open smartphones and other consumer devices.\nBiometrics are used in airports and border control systems. Facial recognition scans identify nationals and allow them to leave one country and enter another. \nIn other situations, this technology can open doors and give approved users access to high-level security areas. In homes, voice recognition is used to control heating, lighting and entertainment systems, and many of us use it to do rapid information searches. \nBiometric security offers a number of benefits. It is not only fast and convenient but also almost impossible to replicate.  \nBut just as passwords can be stolen, fingerprints and other biometric markers are also vulnerable to thieves for so-called ‘presentation attacks’. Unlike passwords, however, they cannot be changed, giving cybercriminals permanent access to any computer or electronic device requiring biometric authentication.\nInternational standards offer guidance based on best practices in industry. Much of the work is carried out in the joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO.\nTopics addressed by ISO/IEC standards include biometric data interchange formats for a number of biometric modalities,  such as finger, face, iris, signature, and vascular data. Other work focuses on biometric technical interface standards (for example, APIs) and biometric performance and conformance testing methodology standards.\nStandardization work also covers biometric application profiles, biometric sample quality standards, and standards in support of cross-jurisdictional issues related to the utilization of biometric technologies in commercial applications. A harmonized biometric vocabulary to serve the standards community, as well as other customers, is also in development.\n \nSee also: Biometric security"

She participated in the #WomenatIEC video campaign and answers our questions on the upcoming challenges for the SSI, including gender diversity.\nWhat is the Standards Institute of Israel doing to recruit more women?\nLike most standardization organizations we have signed the UNECE initiative for gender responsive standards. Since then, we implemented a plan with several different stages. We started by asking all our committee members to take part in a webinar on gender diversity. That gave us an opportunity to share the numbers. These were quite shocking: we found that there were only 18 % women across all our mirror committees. In Israel, we are required by law to include representatives from a wide range of sectors. This means comprising two academics, two people from industry, two from consumer associations, two from government and so on, in each technical committee. We wrote to each of these different stakeholders to let them know that we are willing to increase the number of women. We are looking to organize a special prize to congratulate the sectors which send more women to our TCs. Each quarter we check the numbers to see if we have improved. The other part of the programme is to look at the standards themselves and try to find out whether they take the needs of women into account. We must be more inclusive and not only with women. \nWhat are the other main challenges you face at the SII?\nOne of the main challenges is to convince more experts from Israel to participate in international standardization. We have many start-ups in high-tech fields, such as cyber security, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and drone technology, and many recognized R&D centres in these areas as well. We encourage them to get more involved in the standardization process. I attended many conferences before the pandemic and webinars since then to urge more experts to take part. The message I convey is that standards and innovation go hand in hand and that if we want to export our technology, we need to standardize it and be involved in the process. It is hard work because some young people out of university see standardization as a hindrance to innovating but my job is to convince them of the contrary. I use many examples of companies that have managed to export their technology thanks to standards. For instance, one of the top Israeli companies developed a technology for irrigation which is now used all around the world.\n Read the full interview in e-tech\nView Dalia Yarom's #WomenatIEC video"

        "abstract": "Learn more about IT governance in an interview with Jan Begg, the Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 40.",
        "content": "The challenges of 2020 demonstrated that businesses with strong digital strategies can not only survive, but flourish. Yet with technology evolving so quickly, how can business leaders know they are making the best choices for their organisations now and in the future?\nStandards Australia recently spoke with Jan Begg, Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 40, IT Service management and IT governance. In addition to her role as Chair to the joint international committee, Ms Begg is also the Chair of Australia’s mirror committee, IT-030, ICT Governance and Management, which has played a key role in developing standards in this area for many decades.\n \nStandards Australia: Firstly, what is governance of IT?\nJan Begg: Governance of IT is about the use of information technology in a business, and guides decision-making regarding an organisation’s investments enabled by IT or usage of IT to deliver business outcomes. It provides a framework of digital strategies that a board of directors or leadership team can use to help ensure an organisation’s information, data and technology decisions are aligned to the overall business strategy and will support business goals.\nIn the past, IT was regarded as somewhat separate from a business’s main function. Now, many businesses are reliant on IT decisions and IT strategy is no longer just about cost efficiencies. Board directors with digital knowledge are as valued as those with financial skills.\n \nSA: Why are standards important in this area?\nJB: They have always been important but more recently, with the advent of data being stored in the “cloud”, critical business services (such as payroll and HR) are being managed externally to the organisation and customers becoming more digitally-literate, so the need for standardisation has increased.\n \nBoards and leaders need to stay up-to-date with technology advancements, so costly mistakes are not made, and businesses don’t get left behind. Standards can help with these critical business decisions. Recent international surveys reveal that digital-savvy leaders make better decisions that lead to improved results.\n \nSA: Where does Australia stand on the world stage in governance of IT?\nJB: Australia has been a leader in this space for many decades. Australian experts developed the first release of AS ISO/IEC 38500, Information technology – Governance of IT for the organization, a foundational standard in this space, and are active participants in its continued development.\n \nSA: What types of stakeholders are involved in committee IT-030, ICT Governance and Management?\nJB: IT-030 represents many organisations and experts. These include the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Governance Institute, Australian Information Industry Association, Consumers Federation of Australia, Department of Finance (Australian Government), ISACA, Project Management Institute, IT Service Management Forum, Women on Boards, NSW Department of Customer Services and The Institute of Internal Auditors.\n \nSA: What is happening in Australia and internationally now?\nJB: A major revision of AS ISO/IEC 38500 is currently underway. There is a very strong commitment from IT-030 members to provide up-to-date Australian views. This includes views from the representatives from non-executive directors like me and people who work with company boards. There is also involvement by a range of people with solid technology and business governance and management experience.\n \nWe are also very busy updating and revising standards around IT services management and IT-enabled business process outsourcing, reflecting new business models that provide services or use services from external suppliers.\n \nSA: Generally speaking, what guidance can business leaders find in the series of standards about governance of IT?\nJB: The standards aim to provide practical guidance and principles to assist in guiding Boards and managers in making critical decisions. This guidance aims to help leaders with achieving organisational efficiency, uncovering strategic opportunities, as well as better managing conformance and risk, digital transformation and data analytics implementation.\nThis article originally appeared on the Standards Australia website and is republished with kind permission."

        "content": "We use primary batteries daily in a multitude of gadgets and objects, ranging from children’s toys to sensor-based wearables. A misguided view is that these batteries are on their way out, soon to be replaced by rechargeable batteries, which would appear more environmentally friendly at a first glance.\nBut, as is often the case, the reality is far more complex once you really look at the technology and what is truly happening in the markets.\nIEC Technical Committee 35  prepares standards for primary cells and batteries, outlining specifications, dimensions and performance, alongside to providing guidance on environmental and safety matters. Recycling primary batteries has become an established and common process, thanks, in part, to TC 35 International Standards.\nTC 35 Chair Marc Boolish sums it up: “The number of primary batteries used in the market is increasing. Globally more and more devices can be powered by batteries.\n\"This concerns devices which are difficult, even impossible, to plug into the mains like smart meters or water pressure monitors. There is also increasing demand from new and fast-growing markets such as medical or health-related wearables.\n\"The other trend is that the size of primary batteries has tremendously decreased over the last 20 years. We now employ small coin-sized batteries for a variety of applications, whereas 20 years ago big D-Cell batteries were commonly used.”\nThe TC has just published three new editions of widely used standards, IEC 60086-1, IEC 60086-2 and IEC 60086-3. The first document provides fundamental requirements for and information on primary cells and batteries.\nThe document is regularly updated to make sure it keeps up with the latest advances in both battery and battery-powered device technology. The new edition notably incudes a new table for performance tests relating to storage and discharge conditions and a completely renewed annex F.\nIEC 60086-2 establishes more specific requirements. It complements the general information and requirements of IEC 60086-1.\nThe third publication specifies performance and safety requirements for watches.  All three are available in a redline version highlighting the changes compared to the previous editions in red.\nTo find out how primary batteries are a sustainable option for energy storage, read e-tech."

        "content": "Numerous definitions can be found for smart cities. Often these definitions will depend upon the perspective and the needs of the user. An engineer, for example, will provide a very different definition compared to a policy maker, a tourist or an environmentalist. Yet terminology is essential in understanding user needs and providing the necessary solutions.\nIn the standardization community, variations between terminology can increase the difficulty for cooperation and collaboration between organizations. For this reason, the IEC has recently published a new systems reference deliverable, IEC SRD 63235; Smart city system - Methodology for concepts building. This publication provides a methodology to evaluate the concepts used for smart cities.\nThe methodology recognizes that cities are complex systems and fosters a multi-dimensional system of systems view of smart cities across dimensions, domains and layers. It offers a holistic system of systems approach in order to help users define the views, methodology framework, principles, processes, rules, and evaluation criteria for smart city system concepts building.\nWhile IEC SRD 63235 does not specify the definitions of a smart city system, it provides a methodology based on a system approach to allow for the coordination and harmonization of terminology used by other standards development organizations throughout the lifecycle of a smart city system. It also provides use cases to support the sustainable development of smart city systems, including the convergence of people, process and productivity globally.\nAccording to Xiaomi An, Convenor for the group that developed IEC SRD 63235 “Taking a system of systems view enables for the total capability of the city to be enhanced in way that is not possible for each system to accomplish on its own. Such a coordinated approach allows for the full potential of a smart city system to be achieved. With IEC SRD 63235, we hope that standard developers can use this methodology in order to work together and build upon the same concepts necessary for a smart city system.”"

        "content": "On 11th May 1997, an IBM computer called Deep Blue stunned the world by defeating the reigning chess world champion, Gary Kasparov, in a six-game match. It is regarded as a milestone in the history of artificial intelligence and is a good indicator of how far we have come.\nThe machine that Kasparov faced in that eventful match was a 30-processor supercomputer that controlled 480 custom integrated circuits. Its parallel processing architecture enabled Deep Blue to analyse 200 million moves per second and play out 40 moves ahead.\nThe AlphaZero, chess-playing programme, developed by the AI research company DeepMind 20 years later, takes a radically different approach. Rather than taking Deep Blue’s approach of calculating permutations, it learns from its past successes and mistakes.\nThe way AlphaZero plays chess is much closer to human improvisation than traditional computer chess. According to Wikipedia, AlphaZero searches “only” 80,000 positions per second.\nAlphaZero uses (deep) neural network technology — sometimes called deep learning — which has resulted over the past decade from notable improvements in machine learning. As computing power has increased, deep neural networks have produced machines capable of performing tasks in a way that would not have been possible using traditional programming techniques.\nThis has transformed technologies such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), which are nowadays being deployed on a massive scale in many different products and services. Manufacturing, healthcare and finance are just some of the sectors that use deep learning to uncover new patterns, make predictions and guide decision making.\nIEC and ISO develop international standards for information and communication technologies in over 22 areas, through their joint technical committee (JTC 1). As part of its activities, the committee for AI (SC 42) develops international publications and provides guidance to IEC, ISO and other JTC 1 committees on applications of AI.\nSC 42 recently published ISO/IEC Technical Report 24029-1, Artificial intelligence – Assessment of the robustness of neural networks – Part 1: Overview.\nSC 42 has been looking at the entire AI ecosystem, including novel approaches to addressing emerging issues such as trustworthiness. The aim is to facilitate broad adoption of AI technologies.\nIEC is a founding member of the Open Community for Ethics in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (OCEANIS). This global forum brings together organizations interested in the development and use of standards as a means to address ethical matters in autonomous and intelligent systems.\nIEC has also set up a systems evaluation group to identify ethical issues and societal concerns relevant to its standardization work and other technical activities."

        "published_day": "2021-05-06",
        "abstract": "Thorsten Arnhold, the former Chair of IECEx, provides an overview of IEC work to ensure the safety of hydrogen systems.",
        "content": "A couple of months ago I wrote about the megatrend that is the hydrogen economy. This simple-structured chemical element will have huge significance as a carrier of energy in the future. Since my article, some important events have taken place which underline this statement.\n\nMore and more countries are publishing their national strategies to develop appropriate hydrogen infrastructures within the next 10 to 20 years. For instance, Germany published the national programme in autumn 2020, South Korea published a national hydrogen law at the beginning of 2021, and the UK’s publication of the national hydrogen strategy is expected at the end of Q1.\n\nAll these papers show that there are not only great expectations for the opportunities presented by hydrogen, but there is also now an appropriate awareness of the safety risks and that need to be overcome as the hydrogen economy develops. As an example, the following quote was featured in an article about South Korea’s hydrogen law in The Korea Herald: “Most importantly, the hydrogen law tackles the safety issues that had long remained in a regulatory blind spot. Previously, hydrogen equipment – electrolysers, portable fuel cells and hydrogen extractors – and fuel cell facilities that directly used hydrogen weren’t subject to periodic government safety checks. Now, safety assurance will be carried out in three steps – technology safety at the design stage, an on-site examination upon completion of a facility, and annual safety checks…”\n\nThe hydrogen story is a good example to demonstrate how well the international cooperation between the standardisation organisations ISO and IEC is functioning and how the conformity assessment of IEC can support the establishment of a safe and reliable infrastructure.\nConsidering the typical value stream of the green hydrogen economy, it consists of several main elements: electrolysis, the transport and storage of hydrogen, the distribution to the end users and the final step of transformation of the hydrogen chemical energy into electrical energy by fuel cells.\n\nIEC Technical Committee TC 105 covers the fuel cell technology. There is a set of brand new standards dealing with safety of portable fuel cell systems IEC 62282-5-100 (May 2019), and the safety of stationary fuel cell systems IEC 62282-3-100 (September 2020). The new standard dealing with the safety of fuel cell modules is approaching the final stage (CDV) and will soon replace the current edition of the IEC 62282-2 Ed. 2(2012). [ed note - IEC 62282-2-100 has now been published]. ISO TC 197 mostly covers the rest of the elements of the value chain mentioned before.\n\nTo get a comprehensive overview about all safety related aspects of the hydrogen generation, transformation, transport and distribution process, the Technical Report ISO/TR 15916 (2015): “Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems” is highly recommended. A new version is currently being prepared at ISO TC 197. The international standard ISO 22734 (September 2019) deals with “Hydrogen generators using water electrolysis – industrial, commercial, and residential applications”. Another standard, ISO 19880-1 (March 2020) is about Gaseous hydrogen – fuelling stations – Part 1: General requirements. Both standards require a comprehensive risk analysis at the very beginning of a facility’s design. All detected dangers shall be removed by means of appropriate safety measures.\n\nOne of the most important dangers of hydrogen is caused by its flammability and its tendency to explode. Therefore, explosion protection is a particular focus in the safety standard. In both standards, all requirements for explosion protection are directly referenced to the respective IEC TC 31 standards. There shall be zone classification according to IEC 60079-10-1, the installation shall follow IEC 60079-14 and there has to be regular inspection and maintenance according to IEC 60079-17. If the installed electrical and other equipment must be explosion protected, the realisation shall be according to the respective standards for protection methods IEC 60079 – 0 ff. and ISO/IEC 80079 – 38 f.\n\nWith such a perfect consistency between the standards of two different organisations, it is possible to integrate elements of the hydrogen value chain in the existing conformity assessment systems of the IEC. Since the IECEx system has been testing and certifying equipment for use in potential hazardous hydrogen atmospheres for many years, it should not be too complicated to integrate the green hydrogen processes if regulators require this.\n\nFor me this is another example illustrating the ability of modern global standard organisations to support technical progress by maintaining a high level of safety.\nThis article originally appeared in Hazardex magazine and is republished with kind permission."

        "content": "The topic of cyber security continues to dominate headlines with media articles in April focusing on different aspects of cyber security such as critical infrastructure, policy and the industrial environment. Other topics which generated interest included innovation for industrial automation, renewable energy and power over Ethernet.\nRegulatory issues\nRegulatory issues were explored for a wide range of topics including transformers, refrigerants, cyber security for critical infrastructure and artificial intelligence based on IEC Standards.\n\n        In the Philippines, an article in MSN explained a recent regulatory decision that instrument transformers must conform to requirements in IEC Standards.\n         An article in Hydrocarbons 21 examined the proposal to increase the amount of natural refrigerants used in commercial refrigeration equipment in North America based on IEC 60335-2-89.\n        An article in CSO Online discussed the release of the 100-day plan by the United States to address current cyber security risks in its electric grid.\n        Regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning was the focus on an article in The National Law Review which provided an overview of the tools that the Consumer Product Safety Commission could use to do so, including the standards published by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42.\n\nCyber security for critical infrastructure\nSeveral articles focused on the need to protect critical infrastructure from cyber-attack. Enerzine and The Daily Geek examined the electric grid while Computer Weekly and Rail Engineer focused on railway infrastructure.\nCyber security for the OT environment\nAs the OT environment increasingly converges with the IT environment and accelerates its digital transformation, cyber security risks increase. A number of articles provided guidance on how the OT environment can be protected, many with a focus on IEC 62443.\n\n         Keeping OT environments cyber secure, Control Engineering\n        Securing OT systems from cyber security attacks, Control Engineering\n        High-level risk assessment for cyber security, Control Engineering\n        What IEC 62443 does for industrial cyber security, Control Engineering\n        Industrial Cybersecurity Pulse\n       ATP Journal\n        Industrial Automation\n        IT Daily\n       Tripwire\n\nData security\nAs companies manage vast volumes of data, an article in IT Web argued that securing this data with proper information management is essential. It calls for compliance with ISO/IEC 27001.\nCyber security for smart homes\nAn article in Smarthouse Pro reviewed the different standards and guidelines available for IoT and how they can be used to protect smart homes.\nRenewable energy\nSeveral articles examined aspects the importance of standards for renewable energy. An article in PV Magazine called on the use of standards to ensure the quality of PV modules. Following the icing of wind turbines in Texas (US), an article in Electrical Contractor Magazine highlighted that while wind turbines can operate in a broad range of weather conditions, IEC Standards call for low-temperature designs only for sites with a history of low temperatures occurring for at least 9 days per year over a ten year period.\nA long article in Power Magazine provided an overview of hydro turbine tubes. It mentions IEC Standards for turbine testing.\nInnovation for industrial automation\nTwo articles examined industrial innovation with a focus on the use of open standards. In an article in PEI, IEC 61131-3 is proposed as a tool to manage the use of different programming languages for industrial automation. In Automation, an article called for the widespread use of IEC 61499 which could allow for the convergence of IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) industrial control system based on open standards.\nPower over Ethernet\nTwo articles offered recommendations for Power over Ethernet with an article in All about Circuits focusing about protection recommendations and an article Control Engineering examined tools for troubleshooting. A third article, in Prozess & Automation, provided an update on a draft IEC Standard for the advanced physical layer (APL) for Ethernet.\nEnsuring EMC\nAn article published by Elektroda in Poland provided a long overview of electrostatic discharge (ESD) immunity testing to ensure compliance with electromagnetic compatibility.\nIP rating\nWhile IP ratings are often mentioned in news articles that explain how manufacturers determine the ability of mobile phones to resist water, an article in AV Network assessed the requirements for audio-visual equipment used outdoors in terms of dust and water resistance."

        "content": "A retired couple in the Netherlands have moved into Europe’s first fully 3D-printed house. The two-bedroom bungalow in Eindhoven is the first of five homes planned on the site in the coming months.\nIn the longer term, many in the building industry believe that 3D-printed homes could become a sustainable solution for tackling housing shortages. The technology is friendlier to the environment and reduces costs because it uses less concrete and homes are quicker to build. \nThe new home took just 120 hours to print.\n3D printing means architects can be more creative - the Guardian likens the rounded shape of the bungalow in Eindhoven to Fred Flintstone's home.\n\nIn addition, 3D printing offers an alternative to skilled bricklayers, who are reportedly in short supply in the Netherlands. The building is being undertaken in collaboration with the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU Eindhoven), which is known as a pioneer in 3D printing using concrete.\nThe 3D printer itself is a robotic arm fitted with a nozzle that ‘squirts out’ layer upon layer of cement to build load-bearing walls.  \n\nThe role of International Standards\nInternational Standards are needed for the development of 3D printing from the hardware to the processes and information technology. The data that drives a 3D printer can be generated either by a computer-aided design (CAD) system, or a 3D scanner, or both. \nTheir format must be interpretable by a machine and they need to be stored, exchanged, indexed and secured. Protecting data integrity is also critical when manufacturing safety or mission-critical devices or components.\nISO/IEC JTC 1, a joint technical committee of ISO and IEC, produces international standards for information and communication technologies for business and consumer applications. A dedicated working group in JTC 1 is carrying out standardization work on 3D printing and scanning.\nIn addition, a number of IEC technical committees and subcommittees work on identifying, developing and coordinating international standards for the electric and electronic components that are installed in the 3D printers being used in additive and subtractive manufacturing processes.\nAmongst many other relevant parts and components are switches and relays (TC 17: Switchgear and controlgear, TC 121: Switchgear and controlgear and their assemblies for low voltage, and their SCs), servo and stepper motors used to move the extrusion head or the sintering laser (TC 2: Rotating machinery) and power supplies (TC 96: Transformers, reactors, power supply units, and combinations thereof).\nMost important are the different types of lasers used for sintering metals and polymers. TC 76: Optical radiation safety and laser equipment, is the leading body on laser standardization, including the high-power lasers used in industrial and research applications. Its work is essential to 3D printing."

        "content": "Each year, the ILO celebrates World Day for Safety and Health at Work on 28 April. The ILO leverages this day to highlight the importance of worker safety and health.\nThrough its work, the IEC ensures that safety is an integral aspect of devices and systems, thereby protecting people, critical infrastructure, economies and the environment. IEC Standards can address aspects of safety that apply to many products or specifically address a single product type or industry.\nThe introduction of intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, big data, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence are transforming the connection between technology and people. As more machines are integrated into factory and logistic automation, mobility and healthcare processes, the need to ensure safe procedures for people working with machines is increasing.\nIEC White Paper on Safety 2.0\nIn late 2020, the IEC published a new white paper, Safety in the future, which examines the topic of safety in the new digital environment. It references current social trends and initiatives, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as various real-life examples that are pioneering innovative safety solutions for the future.\nThese solutions share the common understanding that the concept of safety will be delivered in an integrated system in which workers, machines and the environment collaborate. Based on this common understanding, the IEC White Paper introduces a collaborative framework called the tripartite system for safety to provide a systems approach to examining key elements of safety in the future. The collaboration will be made possible by information flows going back and forth between the different intelligent agents of the system: human workers, smart machines, and the IT-enabled environment in which they function.\nHowever, to achieve the goals of the tripartite system for safety will require significant efforts from the standardization community. For example, it will be necessary for standardization organizations to mitigate some of the most pressing challenges related to the decision-making between machines and humans as well as to expand their holistic approaches to safety by gathering insight from the fields of safety psychology, sociology and human behaviour.\nThe IEC White Paper concludes by formulating recommendations of both a general nature as well as specifically addressed to the IEC and its committees."

        "abstract": "To ensure the safety of machines and those who operate them, safety measures are needed. The IEC has issued a new standard to achieve the functional safety of machinery.",
        "content": "To ensure the safety of machines and those who operate them, safety measures are needed. Machinery control systems that provide safety functions will not only detect the risk but, additionally, take preventive action to decrease the risk.\nThe IEC has published a new edition of IEC 62061, Safety of machinery – Functional safety of safety-related control systems. This standard provides an approach to achieve the necessary performance of the safety functions in order to reduce the potential hazards generated by machines. Compared to the previous edition, the scope of the standard has been broadened to include non-electrical systems.\nAccording to Wolfgang Reinelt, Project Leader for the new edition of IEC 62061, “The aim of IEC 62061 has been to apply the requirements of functional safety to the machine sector. With the updated edition of IEC 62061, we have addressed new areas such as non-electronic technologies, software aspects, security and testing.” This edition also offers improvements in terms of structure, readability and the inclusion of many new examples.\nIEC 62061 provides a methodology and requirements to determine the safety integrity for each safety function, enables the design of appropriate safety functions and integrates safety-related subsystems. In addition, the standard provides measures to validate the safety functions.\nUnderstanding functional safety\nThe IEC has published a horizontal series of standards, IEC 61508, which provides functional safety requirements applicable to a wide range of industry sectors. It requires the analysis of the potential risks or hazards of a given system or device and provides categories to determine the level of likelihood of a potential hazard and the consequences should it occur. Safety integrity levels (SIL) are defined to indicate the degree to which a system will meet its specified safety functions.\nIEC 62061 offers a specific safety standard for the machine industry that is fully aligned with IEC 61508 including its SIL scheme, principles and vocabulary. According to Reinelt, “With IEC 62061, we have been able to specify principles that are very specific to the machine industry that are not discussed in IEC 61508.”\nBroadening its scope\nThe second edition of IEC 62061 has enhanced several key areas: functional safety management that addresses the machinery workflow, extending the scope to include non-electrical technologies and safety-related software. Greater emphasis has also been given to software aspects in order to surpass requirements specified in older standards.\nRequirements in the new edition of IEC 62061 focus on the avoidance of faults in the software lifecycle and ensuring that the requirements generate readable, understandable, testable, maintainable and correct software.\nWith the convergence of the OT and IT environments, security is increasingly becoming an important factor that can affect safety. Security is included in the new edition of IEC 62061. As Reinelt explains, “The present philosophy in IEC 62061 considers that security has to be considered in safety-related control systems. It requires that security measures should not have an adverse effect upon safety.”\nThe edition of the standard also calls for security risk assessments in order to identify the threats and vulnerabilities of the safety-related control system."

It was hosted live, in Australia, at Telstra’s 5G Innovation Centre on the Gold Coast and in the Ericsson Lab in Stockholm.\nIt was an opportunity for young talent from the IEC community and at Telstra to explore different ways to learn and to engage with a global audience, while also — and importantly — having some fun. We took a few risks because, as the saying goes, nothing ventured, nothing gained.\nWould live experiments work? Would it be possible to do a live cross outside and what would happen if something went wrong? These are some of the questions the Young Professionals considered when putting together an agenda and planning for something different.\nMaking it new and memorable would mean going beyond PowerPoint slides. The key to success was adapting, being agile and just making it work.\nWe certainly had fun learning along the way.\nWith a mix of live 5G testing in the lab, audience polls, interviews and crossing live to the streets of the Gold Coast in Australia, what could possibly go wrong? We could have asked any TV producer, but I'm actually really glad we didn’t!\nThere were a few hiccups along the way but that just made it more challenging and more fun. During the outside sequences, who could have imagined we'd get British-style wet and drizzly weather on the sunny Australian Gold Coast?\nThe aim was not to produce a broadcast-quality TV documentary but to use the resources available to do something different. In our case, it was literally live over 5G.\nIn the end, it all worked and the agile approach allowed us simply to move on with the programme, no matter what happened. We learnt, created engagement and collaboration with colleagues and other young professionals that will extend well beyond the webinar.\nWe now have stories to share and experiences to build on that will help shape future work and learning. Here are six key learnings from the live webinar experience:\n\nBe experimental\nLook for exciting ways to engage with the audience\nHave a plan to guide you\nBe agile and adaptable\nCelebrate and have fun\nReflect and learn\n\nWith COVID-19 putting the brakes on traditional face-to-face workshops, it is now more important than ever to innovate. If you have questions or would like to share your own experiences of making online meetings more engaging, please get in touch on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI have always said that today's young professionals are our future leaders and I think we are in safe hands.\n \nRelated content\nLive from the Lab Young Professionals — working in 5G and IoT\nYoung Professionals Programme: the next generation of IEC leaders\n \nFind out more\nIEC Academy and Capacity Building webinars\nYoung Professional Programme\n5G"

        "abstract": "Human-generated noise is recognized as a growing challenge for the health of ocean ecosystems. IEC TS 62600-40 helps the marine energy industry measure sound produced by their equipment.",
        "content": "Human-generated noise – whether from shipping, offshore drilling, trawling, military exercises, etc. – is recognized as a growing challenge for the health of ocean ecosystems. Such noise can disrupt sea life which relies on sound for social interaction as well as to navigate and locate food.\nMarine energy, which harnesses the existing energy of water and converts it to electricity is no exception to this problem.\nAccording to Jonathan Colby, Chair of IEC TC 114: Marine energy - Wave, tidal and other water current converters, “Ambient noise in the ocean is growing significantly and in a way that is harmful. It can reach a point where it becomes difficult for echolocating mammals to communicate and navigate through what is becoming an incredibly noisy ocean. While each marine energy converter may be relatively quiet, the regulatory and environmental communities are very concerned about the additive nature of noise in the ocean.”\nTo help the marine energy industry measure the sound produced by the operation of their equipment, the IEC has published IEC TS 62600-40. This standard provides uniform methodologies to ensure consistency and accuracy in the measurement and analysis of acoustical emissions from marine energy converters.\nAs Colby notes, “Noise is a concern for the industry. With IEC TS 62600-40, we are trying to get ahead of potential problems by defining a common methodology to assess noise characteristics. Specifically, use of standardized noise measurements was one of the central recommendations from the IEA-OES 2020 State of the Science report.”\nThe specification defines two methods for measuring the acoustics produced by the marine energy converters. In the bottom mounted characterization, a hydrophone (microphone used underwater) is placed at the bottom of the ocean or riverbed, in order to record the sound. In a second method, known as the drifting concept, a hydrophone is deployed from a floating buoy on the water’s surface.\n“The specification provides the methodologies needed to accurately characterize noise in high-energy wave and current environments. It is then left to regulators and local jurisdictions to interpret the results and decide whether they are acceptable for their particular ecosystem”, Colby remarks.\nIEC TS 62600-40 can also be used to help diagnose problems with equipment. Colby notes, “A developer can detect changes in the sounds made by the system. Often, it can be used as a part of the maintenance or diagnostics to understand performance.”\nMeeting industry needs\nEvery few years, IEC TC 114 conducts a survey to better understand what next standards are most important to IEC National Committees as well as to ensure that the TC develops standards that address industry requirements and knowledge gaps. And, according to the survey, IEC TS 62600-40 was one of the most highly ranked by IEC NCs.\nColby concludes, “We have to be very strategic about our use of resources. TC 114 works very hard to make a prioritized list of new work items. It was agreed that defining a methodology for characterizing noise was a very high priority.”"

        "content": "One of the unexpected effects of COVID-19 is the higher than predicted take up of electric vehicles (EVs) by the population in most countries around the world. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) report How Global Electric Car Sales Defied Covid-19, estimates that worldwide sales of electric cars climbed to over three million last year, reaching a market share of over four per cent. \nAs a result of this global uptake, there are now an estimated 10 million EVs on the road, their rise in popularity a perfect storm of existing policies to reduce carbon levels and targeted stimulus responses to the pandemic. In China, for example, the government pushed back the phase-out of its EV subsidy programme until the end of 2022, while last June in Germany several different subsidies were introduced on EVs. \nFor their part, car manufacturers are increasing the proportion of EVs on sale. One US automobile manufacturer recently announced that its entire passenger vehicle range in Europe will be all-electric by 2030. \nThe Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) has partnered with six of the world’s leading transport and energy organisations, including the IEA and the FIA Foundation, set up by the Federation Internationale De L’ Automobile, to set targets to reduce emissions from road vehicles in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which has a long-term goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. GFEI is also partnering with United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to boost electric vehicle infrastructure in different parts of the world.\nIn South East Asia, where motorcycles, scooters and tuk-tuks are the transport choice for many, the programme is working with EV associations in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand to develop policy that spurs the adoption of two or three-wheeler EVs. As a result, Thailand now has a target to produce 53 000 electric motorcycles by 2025 and is introducing a trade-in scheme to make electric vehicles cheaper.\nIEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems are helping the various industries, regulators and experts involved to move forward and pave the way for EVs to be safe and performance-driven while being as green and as energy-efficient as possible. The IEC recently established a new technical committee, IEC TC 125, to prepare standards for personal e-transporters, such as two-wheeler transportation devices, intended for use on the road or in public spaces. It is working on a safety standard for those vehicles. IEC TC 69 prepares standards for electrical power/energy transfer systems for electrically propelled road vehicles, IEC TC 21 produces standards for secondary cells and batteries. These include IEC 62660 on secondary lithium-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs. IEC 61982-4, meanwhile, specifies test procedures and criteria for the safety performance of nickel-metal hydride secondary cells.\nIncreasing EV sales will have a bigger impact if the energy sources they rely on are also carbon neutral. The GFEI predicts the carbon intensity of the global electricity grid will also need to decrease by at least 90 per cent between 2020 and 2050.\nIEC TC 57 prepares some of the core standards relevant to smart grid technology and the integration of renewable or distributed energy resources (DERs), in the existing grid. It has published IEC 61850-7-420, which help DERs such as solar panels or wind turbines to be integrated in the grid. The committee is working on a second edition of the standard which plans to accommodate EVs.\nSheila Watson, Deputy Director of the FIA Foundation, predicts that when world leaders meet in Glasgow this November to discuss climate change, EV targets and promotion will become a key subject.  “As governments prepare for the United Nations 26th Climate Change Conference, at the end of the year, it’s clearer than ever that electrification plays a vital role in the race to zero emissions,” she says. Watson adds, however, that global sales of EVs will need to rise quite significantly - to 35 per cent by 2030 and 86 per cent by 2050, according to the GFEI’s 2020 status report.\nFor more on this topic read e-tech."

        "content": "Earth Day is marked on April 22 to focus attention on the climate crisis. Every year, hundreds of millions of people around the world participate in activities to highlight the need for immediate action to combat environmental degradation.\nMany of the activities have shifted online, for the second year, because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Marches and special events, including large-scale clean-ups, have marked past editions of Earth Day.\nThe IEC plays a crucial role in protecting the environment. IEC President Yinbiao Shu told the General Meeting, in October last year, that IEC Standards and conformity assessment were not only making cities and critical infrastructure more resilient but also supporting the transition to a less carbon-intensive, more sustainable energy system.\nDr Shu cited IEC work on low voltage direct current electricity, which he said was “addressing the need to bring affordable and clean electricity to the nearly one billion people who currently go without”.>\nAll IEC Standards and CA activities work toward achieving a minimal impact on the environment and optimal use of resources. For example, IEC energy efficiency standards can play a significant role in the fight against climate change.\nIEC Standards and conformity assessment also underpin the increasing use of sustainable sources of electrical power, in areas such as hydropower, ocean power, solar energy, wind turbines and fuel cell technologies. Renewable energy helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while satisfying the ever-increasing demand for energy, both in developed and developing countries.\nIEC standards help renewable energy systems to operate safely and efficiently, whether on-grid or off-grid. They also facilitate the integration of renewable energy systems in the electrical grid. \nIECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) is specifically designed for renewable energy systems. This CA system facilitates the trade of equipment and services in the solar, wind, and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and performance.\nThe IEC has a dedicated advisory committee on environmental aspects (ACEA). It guides efforts to ensure that IEC Standards don’t include specifications that would harm the environment. \nACEA is heavily involved in IEC work on the so-called circular economy. This is a more sustainable economic model that re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption.\nIEC work also addresses the “hazardous substances” used in the manufacture of electrotechnical equipment and systems. IEC expertise helps regulatory authorities around the world to implement measures that prevent serious consequences on the environment or human well-being."

In order to be secure, organizations must be sure always sure that users are who they say they are and that they have permission to utilize specific network resources or to enter restricted areas.\nNot only does access control serve to secure assets, but, in the event of a breach, it can also help to trace actions and to determine the cause.\nThere are two kinds of access controls: physical and logical. Physical controls limit access to premises, workstations and IT hardware, while logical controls are about restricting access to critical cyber assets. Both are essential for cyber security and start from the premise that users, devices and any other entities requesting access are unknown until the system can verify them.\nFor this to happen, they must have a unique and known ID, such as a username, email or MAC address for example, that identifies them when they request access.\nWeak and insufficient measures are quite simply a disaster waiting to happen. The internationally accepted best practice is to limit network access to the level necessary for individuals to perform their jobs.\nKnown as the principle of least privilege, it is one of the key measures that IEC 62443-2-1 recommends for keeping critical infrastructure and other industrial automation and control systems (IACS) safe from unauthorized access. Similarly, ISO/IEC 27001 recommends the principle of least privilege for keeping data safe:\n“Users shall only be provided with access to the network and network services that they have been specifically authorized to use.”\nImplementing such a policy requires a comprehensive approach to the principles of identity and asset management. In addition to managing privilege with care, it is also vital to record all user actions in order to be able to create an audit trail in the event of a breach.\nFinally, adding and removing rights, called provisioning and de-provisioning, must not have a negative impact on productivity. Policies must be in place to add privileges as needs arise and to remove them when projects are completed, or employment contracts come to an end.\nA number of international standards deal with the process of authentication – when a device and user’s identity are verified – and authorization, which establishes whether a user can access a specific asset with her or his level of privilege. These include, for example, the IEC 62443 series and the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards cited above. \nIEC 60839-11-5 covers physical access controls, including biometrics, such as fingerprints and iris scans, and cards. Read more about biometrics standards here.\nAn IEC technical report currently in development will provide guidance on role based access control (RBAC) for intelligent electronic devices and applications at electrical substations. The aim is to tie role-based access control and permissions – as defined in IEC 62351 standards – to IEC 61850 devices and applications.\n \nRelated content\nThe importance of access control for cyber security\nCyber security for the smart grid"

As digitalization continues to advance across industries, systems will have the potential to impact our lives, so we must ensure they are robust, in other words, resilient, accurate and reliable.\nSome well-known examples include healthcare diagnosis, self-driving vehicles and autonomous robots that work side by side with humans in manufacturing facilities. In these situations, there could be serious implications should errors occur. There are plenty of other examples of where AI makes decisions, which impact our lives, such as in financial investments, job recruitment or the approval of loans.\nTrusting the technology\nHow do we ensure AI systems are robust, in other words, how can we know that these systems will withstand the live situation they have been designed for, in terms of ability to function properly?\nOne way to do this is through the development of international standards. IEC and ISO together develop such standards for artificial intelligence, through their joint committee SC 42.\n“Technologies such as artificial intelligence are fuelling the digital transformation of industry”, said Wael William Diab, Chair of SC 42. “SC 42 has been looking at the entire AI ecosystem, which includes novel approaches to address emerging issues such as trustworthiness from the start and thus enable broad adoption. The robustness series complements the portfolio of trustworthy and ethical standards the committee is developing.”\nSC 42 recently published ISO/IEC Technical Report 24029-1, Artificial intelligence – Assessment of the robustness of neural networks – Part 1: Overview, which contributes towards ensuring that products and services using AI systems are safe.\nRead the full e-tech interview with the editor of the Technical Report, to find out more about robustness of neural networks and the types of approaches or methods available to assess issues and risks tied to the robustness of AI systems."

It offers greater capacity, as well as much faster download speeds than 4G and 3G networks.\nThe technology is also very different. 5G uses a new beam steering technology that connects users through smaller, more directional radio signals from the base station, rather than a wider signal that is sent to all mobiles. \n4G and 3G networks have antennas that send the radio signal out in all directions. It is a wide beam and a wide signal that is always there, whether you have one device or 1000 devices.\nTC 106 Chair Mike Wood recently joined IEC Young Professionals working in 5G and IoT for an IEC Academy webinar about global 5G EMF safety testing standards. It included live demonstrations of EMF measurement.\n\nMuch of the efficiency and capacity that 5G offers stems from its beamforming abilities. 5G will identify where the devices are and send a small narrow beam to those devices.\nIt can connect more users through smaller radio signals and this reduces the overall EMF exposure. It works a bit like a theatre usher showing someone to her seat with the help of a small pencil beam torch, rather than switching on the full theatre lighting.\nSince the overall lighting is low, ushers can seat people without disturbing others. In terms of 5G, it means that you are not sending energy to where it is not needed.\n\nIEC Technical Committee 106 prepares international standards on measurement and calculation methods to assess human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. TC 106 brings together global experts from mobile operators, mobile manufacturers, academia, government regulators and testing laboratories.\nThe IEC Young Professionals Programme offers participants and their organization an important networking platform and a unique opportunity to help shape international standardization and conformity assessment work. The IEC benefits from the increased participation of young experts who bring new ideas to its activities.\nThe IEC Academy and Capacity Building team works closely with National Committees, IEC Regional Centres and IEC Departments to build knowledge and grow enthusiasm through high-quality training, workshops, webinars and online learning modules for a global network of experts within the IEC community and beyond.\nWatch the full Live from the Lab video and download the presentation slides here."

        "content": "Information and communication technologies (ICT), from the invention of telegraphy and telephony to the internet, have transformed the way we live, work and do business. All have relied on the development of efficient and sustainable infrastructure, such as the first transatlantic telegraph cable designed by William Thomson, who later, as Lord Kelvin, became the first president of the IEC.\nNewly emerging networks based on Quantum Information Technology (QIT) are no different. QIT will require a physical layer to transport communications resources over distances and between users by means that are efficient, assured, and secure.\nQuantum Transport Technology based on QIT describes the means, media and methods of conveying single or entangled photons over appreciable distances without disruption for diverse quantum applications. The nature of single-photon level signals and entangled resources upon which quantum communications are based pose unique challenges to transport, from the perspective of both network architectures and supporting infrastructure.\nIn essence, not only quantum communication and quantum cryptography, but also quantum measurement, quantum imaging and certain types of quantum computation are dependent on quantum transport technology. IEC Technical Committee 86 on fibre optics is carrying out — via its subcommittees — important work that is directly relevant to quantum transport.\nSC86A: Fibres and cables is responsible for standardization work in the critical area of new low loss. Future development work looks likely to include hollow core fibres to carry single or entangled photons along quantum networks.\nSC86B: Fibre optic interconnecting devices and passive components works on ultra low-loss pluggable interfaces and passive optical routing components, which do not disrupt quantum states. Meanwhile, SC86C: Fibre optic systems and active devices covers single photon emitters or super sensitive receivers.\nIEC and ISO have set up a working group (WG 14) in their joint technical committee (JTC1) to identify the standardization needs of quantum computing. ISO/IEC JTC 1/ Subcommittee 27 is working on quantum resilient cryptography.\nIEC, ITU and IEEE will co-host a webinar on Wednesday 28 April (15:00 – 18:00 CEST) to introduce the latest advances in quantum transport technology. It will and bring together international scientists and engineers from the quantum research community and applicable mainstream industries to discuss the feasibility and scope of the challenges to the commercial realisation of quantum transport.\nIn particular, the webinar will address the question of how to integrate quantum transport capability into existing infrastructures and the corresponding roadmap to building different implementations of the quantum transport network.\n \nRegister to participate"

        "content": "A Joint Symposium on Standards for Quantum Technologies was organized at the end of March to bring together stakeholders from the major standards development organizations (SDOs) that are dealing both with quantum and other mainstream areas, which would be affected by commercial adoption of quantum technologies. It was important to have a structured discussion on where standards would be useful - if at all - in quantum.\nParticipants explored what form the possible standards would take and how we could work together to avoid some of the usual pitfalls when different SDOs diverge, for example by harmonizing quantum terminology. The meeting was extremely interesting and general audience feedback was excellent. We will therefore be organizing a follow-up joint symposium later in the year to continue the discussion.\nOne of our hopes is that we can pave the way for IEC, ISO, ITU and other SDOs to come together to collaborate on a roadmap for the standardization of quantum technologies.\nQuantum technologies have already had a significant impact on the work of IEC technical committees in areas such as lasers and semiconductors. More recently, quantum computing has emerged as a new and very exciting frontier for standardization. I am a member of a working group on quantum computing set up by IEC and ISO in their joint technical committee on information technology (JTC 1). At the IEC, I chair Subcommittee 86B on fibre optic interconnecting devices and passive components.\nThe benefits to society are potentially huge, allowing impossible world-scale simulations to be carried out in reasonable times. As always, though, the dangers are proportional to the benefits when a powerful technology is abused by \"bad actors\".\nQuantum computers could and will inevitably be used also for nefarious purposes, such as cracking powerful ciphers and hacking highly secure installations. Therefore, quantum technologies need to be part of the encryption process.\nThat is why, for example, ISO/IEC JTC 1/ Subcommittee 27, which is best known for the ISO/IEC 27000 series of IT cyber security standards, is already looking at ways to develop quantum resilient cryptography.\nQuantum computing is still very much in its infancy, with new methods of quantum computation emerging now on a frequent basis. That is why it needs total freedom to innovate, to breathe and to proliferate.\nThere are some areas, however, in which standards would be helpful, including raising the performance benchmarks for the equipment and infrastructure required to support quantum computing, quantum measurement and quantum communication.\n \nThis is an edited version of an article by Richard Pitwon.

ACB and DKE Next GEN recently organized a virtual edition of the event, which is aimed at beginners to standardization.\nThe boot camp format is based on an idea by an IEC Young Professional Leader from Germany. Participants simulate the development of a standard, from a new proposal (NP) to committee draft (CD) and final draft international standard (FDIS), through a mix of training, discussions and roleplaying.\nOn the day before the standardization exercise, the participants were given an opportunity to meet and to find out about each other. This facilitates collaboration.\nIn the longer term, it also helps participants to start developing their own networks of contacts in the world of standardization and conformity assessment.\nFor the boot camp, participants were divided into fictional countries and given roles as experts with different objectives. Their challenge was to develop a standard for a “baby robot” through a process of developing their assigned positions, discussing their points of view and reaching a consensus.\nThey discussed a variety of technical and ethical questions, with a particular focus on safety. One of the issues discussed was whether baby robots should be made to look and feel human and whether there was a danger that they might one day replace real babies.\nAnother challenge lay in the design of the interface. Some “experts” drew attention to the vital importance of taking cyber security into account.\nThe design of the maximum and minimum temperature range for outdoor use of the baby robots was also discussed. Some “experts” pointed out that an international standard would have to take into account the widely varying temperatures on our planet.\nFollowing the discussion of the comments, the challenge was to find a common consensus in order to be able to adopt the modified draft standard. Feedback from the event was overwhelmingly positive.\n\"Now that I have taken the first steps in active participation, it was imperative to grasp the big picture,\" said one participant. \"The role of the convenor — that is pure leadership work.\n\"With today's training, I see the work of the standardization experts with completely different eyes. Standardization is an asset and something that should be upheld through personal commitment within the scope of one's own sphere of activity.\"\nAnother participant said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally for the extremely exciting, instructive and simply great boot camp!\nIt really gave me a lot of new, important insights into the world of standardization, which I will definitely use in my future standardization work.\n\"I'm really looking forward to it! I just had fun and joy from start to finish and it was an honour for me to be part of it!”\nIEC ACB works closely with National Committees, IEC Regional Centres and IEC Departments to build knowledge and grow enthusiasm. It offers high-quality training through webinars, capacity building events and national training workshops."

        "content": "While the concept of distributed computing has been around for over 60 years, recently cloud computing has emerged as the most efficient and powerful form of distributed computing yet and it is still improving and expanding. The global pandemic has made cloud computing even more important as more businesses depend upon it and more people depend on access to cloud services as they work remotely. According to Statista, cloud computing generates billions of US dollars in revenue annually and shows few signs of slowing down.\n\nStandards can help to provide confidence and guidance in a rapidly changing industry like cloud computing. Terminology is one key area where standards provide clarity. As such, the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee for cloud computing (ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 38) has recently published the definitive reference for cloud computing. ISO/IEC 22123-1, Information technology — Cloud computing — Part 1: Vocabulary, provides terms and definitions for vocabulary used in this field.\n\nConsolidated Terms - Speaking the same language\n\nISO/IEC 22123-1 consolidates in one document all the terms and definitions for cloud computing established in previous ISO/IEC standards, starting with: \n\nISO/IEC 17788, Information technology – Cloud computing – Overview and vocabulary; adding in,\nISO/IEC 19086, Information technology – Cloud computing – Service level agreement (SLA) framework \nISO/IEC 19941, Information technology – Cloud computing – Interoperability and portability \nISO/IEC 19944, Information technology – Cloud computing – Cloud services and devices: Data flow, data categories and data use; and,\nISO/IEC TS 23167, Information technology – Cloud computing – Common Technologies and Techniques. \n\nStandardized terminology provides a set of agreed definitions and terms for concepts in cloud computing, reducing the level of ambiguity associated with words and phrases allowing people to speak the same language.\n\nCloud computing is defined as a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand. This flexible form of distributed computing allows for the distribution of data and computation across a spectrum of computing devices located on-premises, on the edge, or in high-capacity data centres—using private, public or hybrid cloud deployment models.\n\n“Cloud computing enables one to choose the most efficient place to process their data — whether it be local data emerging from devices at the edge, or central collections of data in a data centre”, says Steve Holbrook, Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 38.\n\nThe standard also defines well known cloud computing terms like Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), container as well as defining the key roles of Cloud service provider (CSP) and Cloud service customer (CSC). It consolidates terms related to cloud computing such as cloud computing deployment models, roles and responsibilities, cloud computing characteristics, service agreements, interoperability, cloud data as well as security and privacy.\n\nAs ISO/IEC 22123-2, Information technology —Cloud computing — Part 2: Concepts, the second part in the series nears completion this year, it will be considered the definitive reference for cloud computing concepts. ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 38 plans to maintain ISO/IEC 22123-1 and ISO/IEC 22123-2 through revisions over time as needed and potentially supersede ISO/IEC 17788 in the future.\n\nIEC also maintains a complete terminology database for use in standardization related to electrotechnology."

We released several publications, including IEC 60079-10-1, which is a new proposition from the IEC, a commented version (CMV) of the standard.\nHow does TC 31 work with IECEx?\nThe previous Chair of TC 31, Mark Coppler, established a formal liaison between IEC TC 31 and IECEx, and this very important step was the reason he received the Thomas Edison Award in 2020. IECEx can assign people to our working groups and each decision sheet issued by IECEx is examined in TC 31, so that we can ensure that it is written in conformity to our standards. We also take IECEx demands for updates as well as requirements for new standards into account. For instance, conformity assessment experts require a standard for the IECEx Scheme for Certification of Personnel Competencies. We are currently working on the third committee draft of IEC 60079-44. The document aims to identify the minimum level of knowledge and skills required to work in hazardous areas and the specific competence required for work associated with equipment for explosive atmospheres.\nCan you explain how TC 31 works with other IEC Technical Committees?\nOur aim is for our standards to be seen and used as horizontal publications across the IEC. We are working on a Basic Safety Publication, which has been accepted by the IEC Advisory Committee on Safety (ACOS), and which will serve as a guide for all IEC TCs. We have also set up several joint working groups, which enable us to work very well with many TCs. For instance, with TC 18, which develops standards for electric installations onboard ships and mobile and fixed offshore units.\nThe full interview of Martin Thedens can be read in e-tech"

        "abstract": "Vertical farming promises a more sustainable future for growing vegetables in a city, especially when paired with renewable energy.",
        "content": "A green investment boom has seen the value of so-called vertical farms soar. A US company specializing in growing vegetables indoors was recently valued at more than one billion US dollars.\nVertical farming promises a more sustainable future for growing vegetables in a city. Instead of planting a single layer of crops over a large land area, stacks of crops grow without using any natural light or soil.\nProduce is grown in a controlled environment where elements including light, humidity, and temperature are carefully monitored. Its proponents believe that vertical farming can feed millions of people while reducing some of the negative aspects associated with current agricultural practices: carbon-emitting transportation, deforestation and an over-reliance on chemical fertilizers.\n\nAmong the benefits, it reduces the environmental impact of transportation by moving production from the countryside to the cities, where most people live. LEDs provide the lighting plants need to grow, while sensors measure temperature and humidity levels. Robots harvest and package produce.\nIn order to produce a harvest every month, vertical farms need to control the elements that affect plant growth. These include temperature, requisite nutrients, humidity, oxygen levels, airflow and water.\nA network of sensors and cameras collects data with detailed information about the plants at specific points in their lifecycle as well as the environment in which they grow. This data informs real-time decision-making about plant health, growth and yield.\nAutomation takes care of tasks such as raising seedlings, replanting and harvesting. It can also be used to provide real-time adjustments to plant care. \nIEC Standards are essential to the technology used in vertical farms.\nInternational Standards for lamps, electric light and lighting solutions are developed by IEC Technical Committee 34 and its subcommittees. Standards for the design and use of semiconductors, including sensors, are developed by IEC TC 47.\nSeveral TCs prepare standards in the area of industrial automation. These include IEC TC 65, which addresses process measurement, control and automation, IEC TC 17, which develops standards for switchgear and controlgear and IEC TC 22, which standardizes power electronic systems and equipment. \nIEC TC 44 provides standards for the safety of machinery. The water used by vertical farms relies on pumps with motors that are standardized by IEC TC 2. \nPairing vertical farming with renewable energy is essential because it is more energy intensive than traditional agriculture. As they switch to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and marine power, they will be using standards developed by IEC TC 82 for solar photovoltaic energy systems, IEC TC 88 for wind energy generation systems and IEC TC 114 for marine energy.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 provides standardization in the area of AI as well as guidance to other committees developing AI applications. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41 develops International Standards for the internet of things (IoT), making connectivity possible, while ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38 addresses the standardization of cloud computing for the storage and retrieval of data.\nIEC conformity assessment ensures that many of the standards used in vertical farming are correctly implemented."

        "link": "https://www.iec.ch/blog/back-future-dc-public-grids-again",
        "published_day": "2021-03-30",
        "abstract": "Learn more from IEC experts about LVDC use cases and the status of LVDC safety standardization.",
        "content": "The war of the currents - between AC and DC systems - is not over. While both technologies emerged at the end of the 19th century, AC dominated much of the 20th century. Now, however, a renewed interest has emerged for DC systems.\nTo better understand this interest, IEC experts involved in LVDC standardization presented LVDC use cases and the status of LVDC safety standardization in a recent webinar organized by the IEC Academy.\nTalking about DC once again\nThe war of the current began at the end of the 19th century when AC and DC co-existed. At the time, electricity was used for lighting and primarily available as a novelty for the elite. By the mid-20th century, however, electricity had become widespread. The massive expansion of a centralized grid relied on AC systems which powered cities and industry.\nHowever, by the late 20th century, the proliferation of modern power electronics heralded a growth in decentralized power generation. Coupled with a growing interest in renewable energy sources that generated DC power and the decentralization of the electricity grid, a new era has begun of co-existence between AC and DC grids.\nAs Vimal Mahendru, Chair of the IEC SyC LVDC, notes, “we are talking about DC once again after about 130 years. We are seeing a real shift with the drop in the cost of solar PV panels and batteries, electronics embedded everywhere and the need for sustainable, green electricity. The common thread is direct current.”\nLVDC use-cases for public distribution\nLVDC used for public distribution is defined as utilising DC voltage with a rate value of ≤1500 V that enables power exchange across and beyond private property and for the purpose of providing power to subscribers on a contractual basis.\nExamples of such public distribution include common utility networks, independent networks for sharing local energy resources and networks used for power charging in public spaces such as electrical vehicles.\nAccording to Harry Stokman, Co-Convenor of SyC LVDC Working Group 2, densely populated areas can benefit from the introduction of a second network that can be used to connect new applications such as electric vehicles, healthcare facilities and data centres using renewable energy sources. “Traditionally, network operators are increasing capacity by expanding existing networks with more or heavier cables and transformers. However, an alternative solution is to introduce a second network which can offers extra capacity in addition to the existing network and can be used to connect new applications,” notes Stokman.\nIn another example, LVDC public distribution networks can also be beneficial in sparsely populated areas where existing networks need to be modernized. In the case of Finland, about 50% of the distribution networks exist to provide a network service to about 5% of the population and thus network development costs per customer are high. According to the Tero Kaipia, Co-Convenor of SyC LVDC Working Group 2, “LVDC networks can be used as a viable option to replace existing AC networks. By doing so, network operators improve their service quality and reduce their renovation and operating costs. It also becomes feasible to introduce renewable energy sources.”\nIEC LVDC use case survey\nIn order to better understand the different use cases for the public distribution of LVDC, the IEC is gathering information to help guide its standardization efforts. According to Kaipia, “We are collecting information to help IEC technical committees know what is happening in the field and how LVDC is being used.”\nThe surveys will be used to define generic use cases and technical system descriptions and develop recommendations for the development of standards. They are open to anyone who wishes to contribute to LVDC standardization work.\nSafety in LVDC installations\nFor historic reasons, few standards address LVDC apart from specific applications such as railways. However, with the increased introduction of DC grids, renewable energy sources, widespread usage of batteries, standards are needed to ensure the same level of safety for LVDC as exists for LVAC.\nIEC TC 64, which focuses on the standardization of electrical installations and protection against electric shock, has begun such work. For example, IEC 60364-1 provides safety requirements for low voltage electrical installations, including DC systems. In addition, existing standards are being updated to provide protections against electric shock, thermal effects, overcurrent and voltage variations in LVDC systems.\nAccording to Jacques Peronnet, Chair of TC 64, “We are moving from a purely AC environment to one that is a combination of AC and DC. We now need to ensure that LV electrical installation are safe whatever the type of current is used.”\nThe presentations from the webinar, including the video, are available on the IEC Academy webinar web page.\n \nRead more\nFeuding geniuses, electric currents and stray dogs"

        "content": "In the past decade, low-voltage direct current (LVDC) has had a revival. Several factors have converged, leading to a renewed interest in LVDC: the decentralization of electricity grids, the adoption of renewable energy sources, and the proliferation of electronic devices and systems. Already, a growing number of applications make use of LVDC systems.\nIn order to better understand the different use cases for the public distribution of LVDC, the IEC is gathering information to help guide its standardization efforts. Through two online surveys, the IEC seeks to gather information about the various LVDC use-cases and the technical specifications relevant to the use-cases.\nAccording to Tero Kaipia, Co-convenor of the working group responsible for the survey, “We are collecting information to help IEC technical committees know what is happening in the field and how LVDC is being used. This will enable us to address standardization needs.”\nThe surveys will be used to define generic use cases and technical system descriptions and develop recommendations for the development of standards. They are open to anyone who wishes to contribute to LVDC standardization work. Submissions are requested by 30 April. While the surveys will remain open after this date, it is not guaranteed that submissions will be considered in determining the initial publication of reference use cases. \nUnless specifically authorized by the respondent, the provided use case and system descriptions will not be published directly in submitted form. However, IEC reserves the right to use the given information in derivation of reference use case and system descriptions, which will be published as a document available in the IEC webstore.\nGathering use-cases\nTo better understand LVDC use cases for public power distribution, survey participants are asked to provide a description of the use-case, its scope and objective. Other types of information requested include:\n\n         Use case conditions, including assumptions related to LVDC deployment and the prerequisites to ensure the implementation of the use case.\n         The commercial readiness level (CRL) of the use case.\n         Any regulatory issues that may be relevant.\n         Key stakeholders\n\nAccess the Use case survey.\nUnderstanding technical requirements\nThe technical specification survey seeks information on the electrotechnical requirements of LVDC systems relevant to the use-cases for public power distribution. This includes information about the technology readiness level of the system, relevant standards, interface equipment, voltages, metering and protection measures.\nContributors should indicate if the technical specifications are subject to IP protection and list the relevant patents. \nAccess the Technical specifications survey.\nIEC approach to LVDC standardization\nFor over 100 years, the IEC has provided international standards for electricity. Over 30 IEC technical committees develop standards to ensure the safety, reliability and interoperability of electricity systems which can be updated to address the requirements of LVDC systems. \nThe IEC has taken a systems approach to LVDC standardization. The IEC systems committee SyC LVDC guides and coordinates the work of all relevant technical committees. In November 2020, the IEC published a new technical report, IEC TR 63282, LVDC systems - Assessment of standard voltages and power quality requirements, which provides recommendation for the standardization of voltage levels and other related aspects for LVDC systems."

        "content": "March 24 is the 201st birthday of the French physicist, Edmond Becquerel, who discovered the photovoltaic effect, which today is used to generate sustainable solar energy. Becquerel created the first photovoltaic cell when he was only 19 years old by coating platinum electrodes with silver chloride and exposing them to light.\nThe young Becquerel successfully generated electrical voltage and current in his experiment, which took place in his father's laboratory. Something similar happens today when sunlight strikes the thin top layer of silicon (or another appropriate material) on a solar panel.\nThe photovoltaic effect creates an electric current that is captured by the wiring in the solar panel. IEC International Standards and conformity assessment help ensure that it happens safely and efficiently.\n\n\nModern solar photovoltaic (PV) systems range from small, rooftop-mounted modules with capacities of a few kilowatts (kWs) to large utility-scale power stations producing hundreds of megawatts (MW). \nElectricity generated by solar PV can be supplied to end-users in different ways:\n\nPV energy systems can be connected to the power grid. Their electricity is usually complemented by that of other power sources.\nPV systems can be used off-grid as stand-alone residential power sources, including for remote rural locations.\nPico-solar systems use small, compact and light-weight PV panels to generate just a few watts of power in small and portable applications (lanterns for instance).\n\nIEC Technical Committee (TC) 82 publishes international standards for PV systems that convert solar energy into electricity, including for all the elements in the entire PV energy chain. It issues a series of technical specifications (TS) which make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. \nSolar PV generates direct current (DC) which enables the most energy-efficient electricity use in rural and remote settings. Low voltage direct current (LVDC) is a key future technology for rural electrification. \nIEC has paved the way for the technology to be standardized so that it can be used safely and efficiently. The IEC Systems Committee for LVDC, SyC LVDC, is identifying gaps where standards are needed. It works closely with many IEC TCs, including TC 82.\nIEC runs four Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems which verify whether a device, or system follow the requirements in IEC Standards. IECRE  and IECEE directly apply to Solar PV systems."

In June 2019, the IEA published a report, The Future of Hydrogen, analyzing the current state of play for hydrogen and offering guidance on its future development.\nOne of the EU governing bodies, the European Council adopted a series of decisions entitled “towards a hydrogen market for Europe\", signed by all EU members. Several prototype hydrogen trains are running in Germany and elsewhere in the world. Japanese and Korean car makers have championed fuel cells for road vehicles. In China, tramways are running propelled by hydrogen and so are buses in many countries.\nIEC Technical Committee 9 which prepares standards for railway equipment and systems, has recently embarked on the development of a new standard, IEC 63341-1, specifying fuel cells for the propulsion of trains as well as any rolling stock type of transport, including light rail vehicles, tramways and metros.\ne-tech catches up with the IEC Convenor leading this project, Julien D’Arbigny.\nWhat are the reasons for this new IEC Standard project?\nA first generation of hydrogen-powered trains already run with fuel cells, notably in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, where they have been used to transport passengers for the last three years. Other hydrogen trains are planned in several countries around the world. The markets are already there. However, we have no standards relevant to the integration of fuel cells into railway systems for traction. We therefore formed an IEC project team, which includes a varied mix of representatives from France, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan and China.\nCan you tell me more about the requirements you will need to look at in the standard?\nWe are focusing on the definition of the interface as well as the description of environmental conditions, for instance temperature and humidity levels, shock, vibration and noise. We will also describe the design requirements to ensure that the fuel cell system complies with railway applications. Other sections of the standards will address the safety, reliability and protection requirements needed for designing and installing the fuel cell system, as well as the validation process for these requirements.\nHow do fuel cells compare to lithium-ion or other batteries as a green way of powering trains?\nThe company I work for views both as key technologies to be used for sustainable trains. The two technologies are complementary. Fuel cells offer trains more autonomy, enabling them to travel over longer distances. But batteries will be used for trains over shorter distances and can be combined with fuel cells for hybrid solutions. Batteries also enable trains to recover energy from the braking process and store it.\nRead more of the interview in e-tech."

        "content": "Quantum technologies are a new frontier for standardization. An important meeting on 23 March will bring together some of the world’s top experts to discuss priorities and opportunities for collaboration.\nIEC, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) UK and Ireland Photonics Chapter are co-hosting the Joint Symposium on Standards for Quantum Technologies. The keynote speaker is Sir Peter Knight, a leading authority on quantum optics. \nLast year, IEC and ISO have set up a working group on quantum computing in their joint technical committee on information technology (JTC1). Before providing a quick reminder of how the technology works, it is important to clear up a popular misconception.\nMany people believe erroneously that quantum computers are faster than classical computers. The fallacy is that because ever smaller processors have brought us quicker computing speeds, quantum computers must be even faster since they work with subatomic particles.\n\nThe truth is that quantum computers are not faster. They simply do things in a different way thanks to the quantum properties of superposition, entanglement and interference.\nClassical computers store data using bits, which have two states — either on or off — represented as a 1 or a 0. Scientists would call classical bits “discrete”, which is the opposite of continuous. \nQuantum computing replaces binary bits with qubits that have more states which are changing continuously. Qubits can take infinitely different values. \nQubits can be on, off or somewhere in between all at the same time. This state is called “superposition” and enables qubit-based computers to carry out far more calculations much faster. When qubits become ‘entangled’ they share all the possible combinations of the quantum states of the individual qubits, substantially boosting computational power in the process.\nA by-product of superposition, quantum interference determines the computer’s function by exploiting the probabilistic behaviour of particles and waves. Notoriously difficult to explain, interference is usually demonstrated using the double-slit experiment.\nThere is no single way to build a quantum computer. Among the technologies used are trapped ions, silicon quantum dots, topological qubits, diamond vacancies and photonics.\nThey all have different strengths and weaknesses. At present, the most prevalent are gate-based computers using superconducting loops.\nThey work in a similar way to classical computers and build on the existing semiconductor industry. The main challenge is increasing the small number of qubits possible today to industrial scale, which is difficult because it is a struggle to keep qubits in their quantum state. \nThe qubits only function “coherently” when they are cooled down to mere thousandths of a degree above absolute zero, which also protects them from the destabilizing effects of radiation, light, sound, vibrations and magnetic fields. They are also prone to errors. \nOnly when it is possible to increase the number of qubits will we have computers powerful enough to run quantum algorithms such as Shor’s. Until then, the focus is on developing meaningful algorithms for today’s Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology.\nStandards development organizations hope they can help to drive innovation by sharing knowledge and best practices as widely as possible.\nQuantum computing explicitly exploits quantum properties but there are elements elsewhere too. Semiconductors and other electronic technologies use quantum mechanics and fibre optic cables can transmit qubits, for example.\n \nRegister to participate in the symposium.\n \nMore about quantum computing\nQuantum computing 101"

It highlights the “potentially devastating security, economic, social and humanitarian consequences” of malicious attacks on the critical infrastructures that keep modern society safe and functioning.\nOne of the most widely reported cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure took place in Ukraine, in 2015, when hackers disrupted the electricity supply to consumers. It left nearly a quarter of a million people without power, in the middle of winter, for up to six hours.\nThe attack was possible because power plants and other critical infrastructures are cyber physical systems, where operational technologies (OT) have integrated with computation and communication (ICT). This has multiplied the number of endpoints and potential ways for cybercriminals to gain access to networks and infrastructure systems. \nThe UN cyberspace report specifically mentions the healthcare sector, which is an increasingly popular target for cyber-criminals. It does not suggest that nation states are in any way responsible for the attacks, but calls on countries to work together more closely to stymie cybercriminals. The last two months of 2020 saw cyber-attacks increase by a massive 45% at a particularly vulnerable time for the sector, when hospitals in many countries were struggling to cope with the rise in COVID-19 patients.\nUnfortunately, those responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in health and other critical infrastructure sectors. From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that, unlike business systems, operational technologies are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. \nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges. The IEC 80001 series of publications was developed for the application of risk management for hospital networks incorporating medical devices. The series addresses how medical devices can be connected to IT networks to achieve interoperability without compromising the organization and delivery of health care.\nThe recently updated cyber security standard IEC 80001–1 defines the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for the risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices. It deals with safety and effectiveness, as well as data and system security, in the context of healthcare organizations, manufacturers of medical devices and providers of other information technology.\nThe widely used IEC 62443 series is designed to keep cyber physical systems running. It can be applied to cyber physical environments found in critical infrastructure, including the health sector.\nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nRead more"

        "content": "Manufacturers increasingly need to assess the environmental impact of their product. While initial efforts primarily focused on energy efficiency, increased attention is now being given to the overall environmental impact of the products, including the CO2 emissions throughout the lifecycle of a product, from its development to its disposal, the efficient use of materials, as well as the reduction of wastes and the release of substances that may be harmful to the environment.\nSpecific to the low-voltage switchgear and control gear industry, the IEC had published a new technical specification, IEC TS 63058, to help assess the environmental impact of these products. Electric power utilities as well as industrial applications rely upon industrial switches and controlgear for their electric equipment. They are used to isolate, control and protect electrical equipment.\nAccording to Antonello Antoniazzi, “With IEC TS 63058, manufacturers now have the tools available to them to assess how their low-voltage switchgear and controlgear impact the environment. These tools are essential for providing the necessary data that can be used when evaluating the environmental impact of an entire system.”\nWhile the environmental impact of these products is relatively minor, especially in comparison with the overall systems in which they operate, the market requires methods for assessing environmental aspects. Increasingly, many countries have begun adopting legislation to requiring material declarations and compliance with the environmentally-conscious design of products.\nThe following environmental aspects are specifically addressed in IEC TS 63058:\nEnvironmentally conscious design (ECD)\nThe decisions made when designing a product can determine the impact the product will have on the environment throughout its lifetime. However, selecting the best environmental options is complex and can require difficult trade-offs. IEC TS 63058 provides an ECD process for low-voltage switchgear and controlgear based on IEC 62430.\nProduct lifecycle assessment (LCA)\nConsideration is given to the outputs generated by the product throughout its lifecycle and the impact that these outputs have on the environment. Modifications to certain inputs, such as the energy or materials used, can influence the output. IEC TS 63058 defines a product lifecycle assessment tool and identifies the potential environmental impacts based on different use scenarios.\nMaterial declarations\nMaterial declaration refers to information about material composition in a given product. To enable standard reporting requirements and facilitate data transfers and processing of this information throughout the supply chain, manufacturers rely upon IEC 62474. IEC TS 63058 provides guidance based on IEC 62474.\nEnd-of-life information\nThe recycling of materials and the energy recovery from waste low-voltage switchgear and controlgear is another aspect addressed in IEC TS 63058. It provides guidance on various approaches that can be taken to ensure safe treatment and to enable higher recovery and recycling rates, starting from the dismantling of the product.\nIEC TS 63058 has been prepared by IEC Technical Committee 121: Switchgear and controlgear and their assemblies for low voltage."

        "content": "LVDC is a disruptive technology for the 21st century. Renewable energy generates direct current (DC) and the electronic devices used in homes, offices and data centres - from LED lights to mobile phones – operate on DC power.\nYet LVDC is not a new technology. In the electricity “war” in the late 19th century which pitted DC against alternating current (AC), AC was the preferred solution because it was cheaper, more convenient and safer. Large power stations could be built on the outskirts of cities and electricity could be transported over long distances with less expensive cables at different voltages and could power different types of devices. As a result, most now countries deliver electricity as alternating current in different voltages. \nDirect current electricity is produced close to where it was consumed, at voltage levels which were the same as those used by lamps or household appliances. While this was problematic in the 19th century, these same characteristics are now driving a renewed interest in LVDC.\nTrends driving LVDC\nThe proliferation of electronic devices\nElectronics and battery powered devices use DC power. These include multimedia devices, mobile phones, IT equipment, LED lighting, electric vehicles, as well as washing machines, refrigerators, fans and cooling systems. Many of these devices are delivered with adapters which convert AC from the wall socket to DC, and in the conversion process energy is unnecessarily wasted.\nRenewable energy\nSolar, wind and water energy yield DC electricity while batteries receive, store and deliver DC power. Currently, this electricity is converted to AC to be converted back to DC for use by DC driven devices. Maintaining the DC electricity chain – from generation to use - is more efficient and generates less waste. LVDC can also provide affordable and sustainable electricity access to those without a connection to the main electricity grid.\nDecentralization of the grid\nThe centralized production of electricity is being challenged by the emergence of so-called distributed power generation. With the proliferation of solar panels on roofs and the installation of small wind or micro-hydro turbines, electricity can now be generated very closely to where it is consumed. With DC power generation and storage, buildings can achieve autonomy from the public electricity grid, trade-in surplus power or buy additional electricity as needed.\nIEC Academy webinar on LVDC\nThe IEC Academy is organizing a public webinar to help better understand some of the main topics in LVDC and the role of IEC standardization. Entitled Back to the Future: DC Public grids, again!, the webinar will take place on 24 March at 12 CET.\nSpeakers include:\n\nVimal Mahendru, Chair, IEC SyC LVDC and IEC Ambassador for SDGs\nHarry Stokman, Co-convenor, SyC LVDC WG2\nJacques Peronnet, Chair, IEC TC 64\nTero Kaipia, Co-convenor, SyC LVDC WG2\n\n\n Registration details are available on the IEC Academy webpage."

        "content": "Raymond Damadian, the inventor of the first magnetic resonance scanning machine celebrates his 85th birthday on March 16. Damadian, a physician, performed the first full-body scan of a human being in 1977.\nThe Nobel committee’s decision to omit Damadian from the 2003 medicine prize for the invention of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was viewed as controversial. “For some, his [Damadian’s] absence from this year's accolades is conspicuous,” wrote the medical journal, The Lancet, at the time.\nThe Nobel Prize was awarded to the American chemist, Paul Lauterbur, and the British physicist, Peter Mansfield, for developing a method to represent the information gathered by a scanner as an image. This is fundamental for the way the technology is used today.\nDamadian has won several other accolades for his pioneering work, including the Lemelson-MIT Prize, a Bower Award and a National Medal of Technology and Innovation, among others. He was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1989.\nNowadays, millions of patients around the world continue to benefit from the invention. Modern MRIs use powerful magnets, radio waves and computers to create detailed pictures that enable doctors to detect a variety of medical conditions and to monitor recovery. \nIEC standards and conformity assessment help to ensure that they are reliable and safe for both patients and operators. IEC TC 62 develops some of the best known and most widely used international standards for electrical equipment in medical practice.\nIEC 60601, for example, covers protection from electric shocks, radiation, fires and mechanical hazards. IEC 62464 provides guidelines on measuring the quality of MRI images. \nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment) schemes test the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of electrical and electronic components, devices and equipment to ensure they comply with international standards. \nUnfortunately, spiralling healthcare costs mean that many hospitals cannot afford to buy new MRIs and other scanning equipment. For this reason, IEC has developed IEC 63077, Good Refurbishment Practices for Medical Imaging Equipment, that defines a systematic process for refurbishing used medical imaging equipment."

        "content": "Over the past few years, trade in counterfeit and pirated goods has risen to 3.3% of global trade, according to a report by the OECD.\nSuch products can be dangerous for consumer health and safety and cause substantial financial losses. Twelve percent of counterfeit product seizures fall in the category of electrical equipment, such as medical devices, toys and household electrical goods. But it doesn’t stop there.\nCounterfeit parts raise risks\nIn recent years, a significant number of counterfeit electronic parts have entered the supply chain, posing performance, reliability and safety risks.\nThese parts may be made of substandard materials, be assembled poorly and not have undergone third party testing and qualification. If they make it into products and systems, it could be disastrous for manufacturers and distributors.\nCounterfeit electronic parts may be removed from devices, cleaned up and presented to the market as new, without assurances that proper methods have been followed to ensure the part is undamaged and reliable.\nInstilling confidence\nAircraft are made of thousands of components. Many of these are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components, originally designed and produced for other areas, such as telecoms or consumer electronics. If counterfeit electronic parts make their way into aircraft and fail to perform, the results could be catastrophic.\nAerospace and avionics industries are addressing these issues through IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, which offers the Counterfeit Avoidance Programme (IECQ CAP).\nThis Programme uses standards which have been developed to avoid, detect, mitigate and dispose of counterfeit parts for manufacturers or distributors, for example IEC 62239-1, Process management for avionics - Management plan - Part 1: Preparation and maintenance of an electronic components management plan, which is the reference for IEC Avionics – Aerospace Defence and High Performance IECQ ADHP scheme.\nIECQ CAP enables manufacturers and distributors to ensure that their products are genuine and perform as they should. It offers sampling, test processes, test results, and production controls, which are monitored and verified by an impartial third-party certification body.\nBenefits of IECQ CAP certification\nManufacturers can reduce risks and liability through IECQ CAP certification as well as benefit from:\n\nInternationally recognized certification of products and services\nAdvanced detection of potential technical problems in the supply chain\nElimination of duplicate testing\nEasier acceptance by regulators and others in the supply chain in many countries\n\nInternational discussion forum for the avionics community\nThe Avionics Users Forum, known as the IECQ Hub, was established by IECQ for different stakeholders in the avionics industry to discuss specific technical issues, industry standards and auditing programmes. The idea is to share expertise, market intelligence and best practices to optimize supply chain excellence and mitigate risk.\nMembers include avionics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their subcontractors, regulators, air-framers and standards developers.\nSome of the technical areas covered include:\n\nAnti-counterfeit/obsolescence management\nMicrocircuits, diodes, transistors, passive and semiconductor wear-out\nLED lighting\nAtmospheric SEE radiation\nMechanical parts"

International standards ensure that they are safe and reliable.\nRobots are widely used in surgery. They cut bones to remove tumours, using laser, and they are also used in urological, bariatric, and gynaecological surgical procedures.\nFully automated, hands-free, robotically controlled digital microscopes allow neurosurgeons to have greater and more accurate vision. The arm is driven by tracked instrumentation and automatically moves the digital microscope to desired viewing angles, which may not be visible to the surgeon.\nImproved optics provide a larger field of view, a higher depth of field and greater colour reproduction. All this makes it possible to see the body structures clearly at all times.\nRobots have also played an important role during the coronavirus pandemic. 5G technology is eventually expected to facilitate remote surgery to help patients separated by distance from surgical specialists.\nThese are only a few examples of what is possible. In all cases, the robots must meet requirements set out in international standards for basic safety and essential performance.\nIEC 60601 has become a widely accepted benchmark for medical electrical equipment, including medical robots. It covers, among other things, protection from electric shocks, radiation, fires, high temperatures and mechanical hazards, as well as application-specific risk assessment.\nIEC 80601-2-77 addresses robotically assisted surgical equipment and systems. IEC 80601-2-78 applies to medical robots that physically interact with patients who have an impairment, for the purposes of rehabilitation, assessment compensation, or alleviation.\nFunctional safety is covered in IEC 61508 for the robot, while IEC 62061 applies to the electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic control systems.\nIn addition, IEC experts develop international standards for many of the technologies that these robots incorporate, such as sensors, batteries, and semiconductors. IEC conformity assessment adds value to many of these standards by checking that the requirements have been met.\nFor example, IECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components provides testing and certification for the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of 22 categories of products. This includes electrical equipment for medical use related to IEC 60601 series of standards."

Terms and concepts evolve together with the changing technological landscape, at a pace that no one would have even imagined 10 years ago.\nA case in point is the terminology for lighting. It has changed significantly over the last decades, with the widespread adoption of Light Emitting Diodes (LED) and other new technologies, such as human centric lighting. (Read about these in Smart lighting)\nWith a view to bringing the terminology for lighting up to date, the IEC published a 190-page document just before the end of 2020. This massive endeavour involved close cooperation between the IEC and the International Commission for Illumination (CIE).\nIEC 60050-845 was prepared jointly by IEC TC 34: Lighting, and the CIE under the guidance of IEC TC 1, which is responsible for the IEC Electropedia, also known as the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV). It is completely harmonized with the second edition of the CIE standard CIE S 017:2020 ILV: International Lighting Vocabulary.\nA key debate focused precisely on the terminology for LED. As TC 34 expert Wei Zhang explains: “One of the issues we had with LED is that it refers not only to the physical unit but also to the technology and that resulted in many discussions. We also needed to consider consistency aspects for many other terms based on LED, not only the accuracy of the term LED itself.”\nFor more information on the standard, read e-tech."

        "content": "International standards are essential to global markets. By ensuring the safety, performance and interoperability of products, they facilitate global trade while also protecting end users. \nTo help developing and newly industrializing countries to participate in IEC standardization and conformity assessment activities without the financial burden of membership, the IEC established its Affiliate Country Programme in 2001.\nWhy conformity assessment?\nProducts that are unsafe or do not perform adequately can undermine markets. In an example from rural Ethiopia, the onslaught of poor quality and counterfeit solar PV products – without government approval or product guarantee – has resulted in the failure and/or poor performance of these products. The effect can be financially devastating for households and impede the roll-out of these products.\nTo help affiliate countries better understand how conformity assessment can help protect against unsafe and poor-quality products, the IEC appointed Trond Sollie to serve as the IEC Ambassador for affiliate country training needs in conformity assessment.\nAccording to Sollie, “In the IEC context, conformity assessment is primarily the demonstration that electric and electronic equipment comply with relevant safety standards. Testing, inspection and certification are part of this concept, either as a stand-alone activity or taken all together or in combination.”\nConformity assessment helps to remove barriers to trade while also providing regulators and consumers with the knowledge that products respect globally recognized standards for safety and performance. “This is, of course, essential for all countries, but increasingly important for developing countries as electrical and electronic products are becoming commonplace for more and more inhabitants,” notes Sollie. “There is a risk of these countries becoming ‘dumping grounds’ for imported sub-standard products which may be unsafe.”\nLearning with ACAS\nTo help affiliate countries participate in the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems – IECEE, IECQ, IECEx and IECRE – the IEC has set up Affiliate Conformity Assessment status (ACAS). As part of ACAS, affiliate countries are trained to use IEC International Standards and participate in the IEC CA Systems through the recognition of IEC CA certificates at the national level.\nAs Sollie explains, “The web-based ACAS training modules are an excellent ‘academic entrance’ for understanding the basics of the IEC CA Systems and a stepping-stone for getting further involved. It is a good starting point for national electrotechnical committees (NEC) to ensure that also conformity assessment is part of their national agenda.”\nOne key feature of the IEC CA Systems is the mutual acceptance of test reports and certificates. This facilitates trade among participating countries and certification organizations by promoting the harmonization of standards and cooperation among certification bodies worldwide. Sollie highlights the IECEE CB scheme which offers “safety assurance of electrical and electronic consumer products and which is therefore relevant for all countries”.\nThe full article as well as a separate interview with Trond Sollie is available on e-tech."

Vehicles for aerospace are built using many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components, originally designed and produced for other areas, such as telecoms or consumer electronics.\nThis means that their designs, configuration-control processes, qualification methods, and reliability-assurance practices have evolved and been implemented without considering the requirements of aerospace users.\nAnother key issue facing the industry is the speed with which COTS components evolve and the new issues arising, which may affect the safety of these parts when used in the air.\nSince the responsibility falls with the manufacturers to ensure the safety of the vehicles they produce, the avionics industry has had to define its own processes to demonstrate reliability for the COTS parts used in planes.\nThe benefits of IECQ certification\nIECQ is the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components. It is an approval and certification system covering the supply of electronic components and associated materials and assemblies (including modules) and processes.\nIECQ helps electronic component parts suppliers guarantee that their products meet requirements of IEC International Standards. It saves time and cost by avoiding the need for repeat second party auditing of electronic component part suppliers.\nTwo key aspects are covered:\nFacility certification: An IECQ Certification Body (CB) evaluates a supplier’s quality management system and grants facility certification for a process or family of components or component parts concerned, to a specific specification or standard.\nProduct certification: Suppliers must demonstrate, through testing, that the component conforms to the relevant quality assessment specifications declared by the manufacturers. If suppliers have in-house testing facilities to carry out all tests required by the specification or standard, the IECQ CB will ensure the facilities are adequate. Alternatively, external testing laboratories accepted by IECQ CB may be used.\nThe IECQ Avionics Scheme ensures third-party assessment and certification of compliance of avionics parts and assembly management requirements to IEC Technical Specification 62239, published by IEC Technical Committee 107 which develops process management standards for systems and equipment used in avionics, which includes electronics used in commercial, civil and military aerospace applications.\nPart 1 covers process management for avionics for the preparation and maintenance of an electronic components management plan and Part 2 covers the preparation and maintenance of an electronic COTS assembly management plan.\nThese publications provide the structure for avionics equipment manufacturers, subcontractors, maintenance facilities, and other aerospace component users to develop their own electronic component management plan.\nThe aim is to guarantee customers that all electronic components in the equipment of the plan owner are selected and applied in controlled processes compatible with the end application, and that technical requirements listed in the standard are accomplished. These cover: component selection, application, qualification, quality assurance, dependability, compatibility with the equipment manufacturing process, data and configuration control.\nCounterfeit avoidance\nIECQ also offers the Counterfeit Avoidance Programme (IECQ CAP) which allows any equipment manufacturer or subcontractor to develop and implement the systems required to obtain an IECQ CAP Certificate of Conformity.\nThis global programme provides confidence that an organization has processes for managing counterfeit avoidance in the selection and use of components according to IECQ CAP technical and quality management system requirements.\nFind out more about IECQ."

Vehicles for aerospace are built using many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components, originally designed and produced for other areas, such as telecoms or consumer electronics.\nThis means that their designs, configuration-control processes, qualification methods, and reliability-assurance practices have evolved and been implemented without considering the requirements of aerospace users.\nAnother key issue facing the industry is the speed with which COTS components evolve and the new issues arising, which may affect the safety of these parts when used in the air.\nSince the responsibility falls with the manufacturers to ensure the safety of the vehicles they produce, the avionics industry has had to define its own processes to demonstrate reliability for the COTS parts used in planes.\nThe benefits of IECQ certification\nIECQ is the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components. It is an approval and certification system covering the supply of electronic components and associated materials and assemblies (including modules) and processes.\nIECQ helps electronic component parts suppliers guarantee that their products meet requirements of IEC International Standards. It saves time and cost by avoiding the need for repeat second party auditing of electronic component part suppliers.\nTwo key aspects are covered:\nFacility certification: An IECQ Certification Body (CB) evaluates a supplier’s quality management system and grants facility certification for a process or family of components or component parts concerned, to a specific specification or standard.\nProduct certification: Suppliers must demonstrate, through testing, that the component conforms to the relevant quality assessment specifications declared by the manufacturers. If suppliers have in-house testing facilities to carry out all tests required by the specification or standard, the IECQ CB will ensure the facilities are adequate. Alternatively, external testing laboratories accepted by IECQ CB may be used.\nThe IECQ Avionics Scheme ensures third-party assessment and certification of compliance of avionics parts and assembly management requirements to IEC Technical Specification 62239, published by IEC Technical Committee 107 which develops process management standards for systems and equipment used in avionics, which includes electronics used in commercial, civil and military aerospace applications.\nPart 1 covers process management for avionics for the preparation and maintenance of an electronic components management plan and Part 2 covers the preparation and maintenance of an electronic COTS assembly management plan.\nThese publications provide the structure for avionics equipment manufacturers, subcontractors, maintenance facilities, and other aerospace component users to develop their own electronic component management plan.\nThe aim is to guarantee customers that all electronic components in the equipment of the plan owner are selected and applied in controlled processes compatible with the end application, and that technical requirements listed in the standard are accomplished. These cover: component selection, application, qualification, quality assurance, dependability, compatibility with the equipment manufacturing process, data and configuration control.\nCounterfeit avoidance\nIECQ also offers the Counterfeit Avoidance Programme (IECQ CAP) which allows any equipment manufacturer or subcontractor to develop and implement the systems required to obtain an IECQ CAP Certificate of Conformity.\nThis global programme provides confidence that an organization has processes for managing counterfeit avoidance in the selection and use of components according to IECQ CAP technical and quality management system requirements.\nFind out more about IECQ."

        "content": "March 4 marks the second annual World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development (WED). UNESCO created the international day in 2020 to celebrate the achievements of modern engineering and to draw attention to the importance of technology for sustainable development.\n“Technology is a big game-changer,” says Vimal Mahendru, the convenor of an IEC task force related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a set of ambitious targets aimed at tackling poverty, hunger, climate change and other global problems.\n“Across the world, it [technology] has lifted people out of poverty. Going back 130 years when, for the first time, Thomas Edison brought electricity to a small part of New York, technology has been the cornerstone of economic development and, as a consequence, has improved our lives through innovation.”\nIEC International Standards and IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems contribute to all of the 17 SDGs. They provide the foundation that allows all countries to put in place sustainable, resilient infrastructure to stimulate economic development and innovation and apply global best-practice to manage quality and risk.\nEnergy, and especially electricity, is the common thread of the SDGs, and intrinsically related to the development of every nation and economy. IEC work provides the technical foundation for the entire energy chain and all equipment that is driven by electricity.\nIt improves the safety of devices, workers and populations, as well as enabling energy efficiency gains and increasing the resilience and long-term viability of infrastructure.\nThe four IEC conformity assessment schemes test and certify that products and services meet IEC standards. The schemes cover electrical equipment and components (IECEE), equipment for use in explosive atmospheres (IECEx), quality assessment for electronic components (IECQ) and equipment for renewable energies (IECRE).\nIEC International Standards embody global consensus on methodologies, processes, and specifications and are often used in regulations. They enhance access to technology and innovation, promote the development, transfer, and dissemination of environmentally sound technologies, and facilitate participation in global trade.\n“IEC expertise can play a crucial role in protecting the environment and building a better future for the whole of humanity,” IEC President Shu Yinbiao told last year’s 84th General Meeting.\n“We are supporting the transition to a less carbon-intensive, more sustainable energy system. At the same time, our ground-breaking work on low voltage direct current (LVDC) is addressing the need to bring affordable and clean electricity to the nearly one billion people who currently go without”.\nThis is reflected in the mission of the IEC to ensure the safety, efficiency, reliability and interoperability of electrical, electronic and information technologies, to enhance international trade, facilitate broad electricity access and enable a more sustainable world.\nHappy World Engineering Day!\n \nRead more\nHow the IEC helps achieve the SDGs"

This key event is an opportunity for experts involved in the field to debate and present their views in areas as varied as cyber security, digital twin, climate change, digitization or AI.  \nIEC will be present at the event and one of its key experts on standards for the IoT and digital twin, François Coallier, will be explaining his vision during a panel discussion Building your Defence – Security for the IoT eco-system. It will kick off at 12.20 GMT and topics addressed will be transparency, best practices for manufacturers and users as well as emerging technologies.\nAmong many things, Coallier will allude to the difference between information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) and how that difference has an impact on cyber security, especially when it comes to the industrial IoT (IIoT). “There are no fully secure systems: implementing security is fundamentally a risk management exercise, and that is where standards can help. It should also be noted that security is only one attribute that contributes to the trustworthiness of IIoT systems. Other attributes that may need to be taken into account are safety, availability, resilience and privacy, which require benchmarks“, he says."

        "content": "Since 1 March, it is no longer possible to use halogenated flame retardants in electronic display enclosures and stands within the European Union. This includes equipment such as computer monitors, televisions, and digital signage displays with a screen measuring more than 100 cm².\nThis new requirement is one of a set of new eco-design requirements approved by the European Commission in October 2019 as part of their Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC). Other requirements include rules regarding the repairability of household appliances and product labelling. This is part of an effort by the European Commission to promote the objectives of a circular economy in Europe.\nUnderstanding halogens\nHalogens are generally considered to be any of the group of five chemical elements of the periodic table consisting of fluorine (F), chlorine (CI), bromine (Br), iodine (I) and astatine (At).\nHalogens are also used widely in electrical and electronic products. For example, they can be found in printed circuit boards, components such as connectors, ion batteries, electrical cables as well as in the plastic cases around television sets and mobile telephones.\nThe widespread use of halogens in electrical and electronic products can be attributed to three factors: their performance properties, relative low cost and abundance of the raw material. Most notably, halogens are used as flame retardants since some halogen-derived compounds provide extremely high resistance to heat which can limit combustion in a fire.\nWhile halogens can provide many benefits, they are also associated with risk. Halogen compounds, if ignited in a fire, release corrosive and toxic gases. As a result, some countries have put in place regulations to restrict the use of certain hazardous substances. In Europe, some halogenated compounds have been restricted because of their high toxicity. \nWith its new restrictions halogenated flame retardants, however, the European Commission seeks to facilitate the use of discarded materials and make recycling less onerous. Prior to this restriction, plastics that contain brominated flame retardants needed to be treated separately under the EU electronic waste regulation.\nHow standards can help\nManufacturers have also begun to address concerns with certain halogen substances by developing products with limited halogen content. However, the terms employed to describe the halogen content are not standardized and can often have different meanings depending on the manufacturer, the industry or the products for which the material is being used.\nIEC, along with other standards development organizations and environmental performance programmes, is developing standards for the quantification of halogen content in products.\nHowever, inconsistencies exist in the terminology used as well as in the test methods and requirements. Different terms like halogen free, non-halogenated, zero halogen and low halogen are sometimes used to express similar halogen content. Different limits for halogens are sometimes used despite applying the same term. In some cases, similar terms are used when referring to different halogen types.\nThe reasons for these discrepancies are varied. For example, the terminology may be specific to certain categories of products or may have been developed when certain kinds of data were not yet available. Regardless of the reasons, the variety of terminology in existence and the definitions of the terms creates confusion within industry and its supply chain.\nGuidance is needed in order for the terminology used for halogen-related provisions to be uniform and clear. Careful consideration is also needed when selecting test methodology to determine halogen content. For these reasons, the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Affairs (ACEA) is developing a Guide for standards developers on this topic."

        "content": "The IEC 62443 series was developed to secure industrial automation and control systems (IACS) throughout their lifecycle. It currently includes nine standards, technical reports (TR) and technical specifications (TS).\nIEC 62443 was initially developed for the industrial process sector but IACS are found in an ever-expanding range of domains and industries, such as power and energy supply and distribution, and transport. IACS technologies are central to critical infrastructure.\nIT standards are not appropriate for IACS and other OT (operational technology) environments. For example, they have different performance and availability requirements, and equipment lifetime. Moreover, cyber-attacks on IT systems have are essentially economic consequences, while cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure can also be heavily environmental or even threaten public-health and lives.\nInternational standards are based on industry best practices and reached by consensus. Implementing IEC 62443 can mitigate the effects and often prevent successful cyber-attacks. It can bolster security throughout the lifecycle and reduce costs.\nIEC 62443 addresses not only the technology that comprises a control system, but also the work processes, countermeasures, and employees. The standard takes a holistic approach because not all risks are technology-based: the staff responsible for an IACS must have the required training, knowledge and skills to ensure security.\nIEC 62443 takes a risk-based approach to cyber security, which is based on the concept that it is neither efficient nor sustainable to try to protect all assets in equal measure. Instead, users must identify what is most valuable and requires the greatest protection and identify vulnerabilities.\nThey must then erect defence-in-depth architecture that ensures business continuity.\nThe IEC 62443 series of standards is organized into four parts:\nGeneral \nPart 1 covers topics that are common to the entire series:\n\n1-1 (TS): Terminology, concepts and models\n\nPolicies and procedures \nPart 2 focuses on methods and processes associated with IACS security:\n\n2-1: Establishing an IACS security program\n2-3 (TR): Patch management in the IACS environment\n2-4: Security program requirements for IACS service providers\n\nSystem \nPart 3 is about requirements at the system level:\n\n3-1: Security technologies for IACS\n3-2: Security risk assessment for system design\n3-3: System security requirements and security levels\n\nComponents and requirements\nPart 4 provides detailed requirements for IACS products:\n\n4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements\n4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS components\n\nConformity assessment\nIn addition, IEC conformity assessment verifies that standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems. To this end, the IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme tests and provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nBoth IEC 62443 and the IECEE programme help to protect critical infrastructure. In this way, they contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16, which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies."

It leads the country in total electricity production and – if considered an independent country - ranks as the 11th largest producer. \nYet, this past week, electricity in Texas has made headlines for a different reason. Because of a massive cold weather storm, millions of people have been left without electricity for days.\nWhat happened?\nIn simple terms, Texas has found itself with a problem of supply and demand. The cold weather storm brought the lowest temperatures recorded in decades in the state. As a result, households increased their electricity consumption to stay warm.\nYet, the supply was not forthcoming. Because of the cold, the infrastructure used for energy generation and transmission was freezing up or taken offline. Wind turbines froze and natural gas facilities and pipelines were shut down due to the cold and frozen wellheads.\nAnd because Texas operates its own power grid, it was cut off from other power sources in the United States.\nPreparing for extreme weather \nIn Texas, demand for electricity surges in the summer months with the hot weather and heavy reliance on air conditioners. In contrast, the winter period when electricity demands are low, is used to undertake routine maintenance. And because of the mild winter weather, infrastructure is not designed to withstand unusually cold weather.\nAs extreme weather events are likely to occur more frequently, a new type of resiliency for utilities may be necessary. Manufacturers must ensure from the outset, that their equipment will endure all weather conditions throughout its lifecycle.\nIEC Standards are designed so that infrastructure can withstand all types of weather conditions including extreme weather conditions. It will now be necessary for planners to prepare for these different types of weather conditions– including ice and snow in Texas."

We had been scheduled to meet face to face at the UL facility in Northbrook over two full days, but the three much shorter days, using Go-to-Meeting, worked well.\nThe Chair’s Advisory Group (CAG) is a forum in which those who play a leading role in the creation of standards in the Ex field can get together and provide advice to the chairman of TC31 on the direction of the Committee, its Sub-Committees, Working Groups (WGs) and Maintenance Teams (MTs). There is also an opportunity to talk through problems created by new technological developments. On this occasion 44 people joined the meeting, most for all three days.\nThere were three technical discussions which are worth noting.\nTemperature control of heating devices\nIt was agreed that not all concept standards require specific control of temperature to the same degree. Increased Safety (60079-7) and Trace Heating (60079-30-1) have the most comprehensive requirements, but others, such as Flameproof (60079-1), leave much more to the installer of the equipment to decide how to limit temperature, particularly of immersion heaters. An ad-hoc WG of the MT convenors for the relevant standards will be convened, to attempt a more common approach.\nDigital marking of equipment\nIndustrially, more and more use is being made of the ability of equipment to identify itself electronically, whether by the use of QR Codes on the label, or RF identification tags. Logically, this must come for Ex Equipment, but there are problems in ensuring that device readers are both universally available and also suitable for use in hazardous areas.\nWe discussed the potential of two German standard QR type codes (carrying different amounts of information) and the problems of readability when the code has been subject to damage in a harsh environment. At this time, the decision was that, if such electronic identification was to be used, it must be in parallel with the minimum amount of information in hard text form that is required by our standards (I may be willing to embrace modern technology, but I grew up in a world and industry where the norm was the use of cast brass for marking plates, and I can still see the benefits!).\nLithium Ion batteries\nIt does not seem that long ago that we were hearing of battery fires in Boeing 787 Dreamliners and exploding Samsung phones. Battery technology continues to develop at an incredible pace, and although those problems were solved, new chemistry creates additional problems. Yet there is a desire to be able to employ some of the latest designs in hazardous areas. There would be significant environmental benefit in being able to remove all diesel engines from underground mines and replace such mobile equipment with high powered battery equivalents.\nWe learnt of a number of experiments that had taken place, demonstrating how difficult it would be to contain an explosion from the latest high energy density batteries in a flameproof enclosure. It should be stated that the experiments seem to have been conducted with cells and batteries that are not permitted by the current flameproof standard – IEC 60079-1 – but the pressure of the needs of industry will be driving a potential change to the standard. If you want to see the potential disaster that might await, there is a video available at bit.ly/3nvj7AZ. But do remember that the current standard puts significant limitations on the type of cell that can be used in a flameproof enclosure. For traction duties in Europe, we typically use batteries housed and tested to the Increased Safety standard (60079-7) which is strictly limited to lead-acid, nickel-iron, nickel-metal hydride or nickel-cadmium types.\nIf technology never changed, we need never change our standards, but technology does change, and we do have to modify our standards to cope. The 44 people that met electronically in November are part of that ongoing process.\nSGS Baseefa’s Technical Manager Ron Sinclair MBE is a vice-chair of the European Notified Bodies Group for ATEX (ExNBG), as well as Chair of the IECEx Service Facility Certification Committee and a member of the IECEx Executive. He is chair of the UK Standard Body operating in this area for electrical equipment, and recently retired as chair of the European committee.\nThis is an edited version of an article that originally appeared in Hazardex magazine.

        "content": "In one of the latest Star Wars films, Princess Leia appears as a hologram, a poignant reminder for fans and viewers of the earlier parts of the saga. This may be science fiction but real-life is catching up as innovative companies invent the technology to be able to see and interact with 3D holograms in real-time. \nCardiologists and cardiac surgeons at Toronto General Hospital’s Peter Munk Cardiac Centre (PMCC) performed the first live medical procedure using real-time holographic imaging. Developed by an Israeli company, HOLOSCOPE-I provides realistic, spatially accurate 3D in-air holograms. \nUsing these images, cardiologists performed a minimally invasive procedure that replaced a worn-out surgical valve in a patient’s heart. \nThe 3D visualisation technique is a big improvement compared to previous attempts with headsets, which led to eye fatigue and nausea when worn for long periods of time. The HOLOSCOPE-I technology uses computer-generated holography to build the patient's anatomy from acquired volumetric data and uses points of light in space to represent each volumetric co-ordinate. \nBy employing digital techniques, the image can be manipulated without the restrictions of solid structures, changing shapes and positions while remaining true to the acquired data. The hologram floats in the air in a space in front of the observer at touching distance. \nThe observer can view the image from every angle and perspective. The image can be freely rotated, sliced and even marked. \nThese interactions give the viewer intuitive and unlimited access to all the volumetric data, as if it is the actual object held in the viewer's hand.\nIs there life on Mars?\nOther advanced fields of science are using holographic microscopes to determine whether life exists on other planets. In digital holographic microscopy, an object is illuminated with a laser and the light that bounces off the object and back to a detector is measured. \nThis scattered light contains information about the intensity of the scattered light and data about how far the light travelled after it scattered. With these two types of information, a computer can reconstruct a 3D image of the object that can show motion through all three dimensions. \nWhen applied to spots observed on faraway planets, detecting motion helps to distinguish between specks of sand and bacteria. IEC is preparing standards for this very advanced field of technology IEC Technical Committees 110 prepares standards for electronic displays, including OLED, 3D, holographic as well as flexible screens. \nIt publishes IEC 62341-2-1 on OLED displays for instance, which specifies the essential ratings and characteristics of OLED display modules. It has also issued IEC 62629-41-1, a technical report on 3D and holographic display devices.\nIEC TC 76 was set up to produce safety standards for lasers as well as LEDs. One of the TC’s major endeavours is the publication of IEC 60825-1. \nThis standard offers a global classification scheme of laser products according to their safety requirements and emission limits. It is widely used by industry and is viewed as THE reference for any laser equipment by manufacturers, installers and regulators in most countries around the world. \nFor instance, the standard specifies the determination of the nominal ocular hazard distance from the laser source. It also publishes IEC 62471-5 which applies to image projectors, using laser light."

This came at a time when any interruption in healthcare would have been potentially catastrophic as hospitals in many countries were overwhelmed by the rise in coronavirus patients \nHospitals make attractive targets for cyber-criminals. Many have obsolete IT systems and medical devices with weak or no protection.\nIn addition, they rely on third-party services, which exposes them to supply chain vulnerabilities, and they store a wide range of personal data from their patients. The growth of connected medical devices in hospitals has exacerbated the situation by accelerating the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT).\nThe challenge, from a cyber security perspective, is that unlike business systems, hospital networks are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. In an IT environment, a cyber security strategy aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems (CIA).\nIn hospitals, the convergence of IT and OT technologies places the focus is on protecting the safety, integrity, availability and confidentiality (SIAC) of a diverse range of traffic, ranging from life-critical patient data requiring immediate delivery and response, to general administrative data.\nHospitals and other critical systems also place a greater emphasis on availability. The easiest way to understand this is by considering what happens in the event of an attack.\nFor IT-led organizations, one of the first lines of defence is shutting the entire system down. In hospitals, however, life-saving medical devices must be able to run permanently to ensure patient safety. In addition, medical devices need to be able to communicate freely throughout the hospital.\nThe same is also true for other essential services, such as pharmacies and nursing stations. Shutting down is just not an option.\nUnfortunately, the emphasis on maintaining an open network, with the ability to provide a quick response to the medical needs of patients, makes hospitals relatively easy targets for cyber criminals. The risks are two-fold: in a worst-case scenario, attacks could stop critical medical devices from working properly; a hacked medical device could also provide a gateway into the hospital network to steal sensitive patient data.\nIn 2017, hospitals around the world fell victim to the WannaCry ransomware attacks that denied affected computers access to patient health records. It resulted in the cancellation of critical surgeries and emergency patients being turned away because doctors could not check medical histories or allergy warnings.\nMedical devices were also affected.\nThe newly updated cyber security standard IEC 80001-1 defines the roles, responsibilities and activities that are necessary for the risk management of IT-networks incorporating medical devices. It deals with safety and effectiveness, as well as data and system security, in the context of healthcare organizations, manufacturers of medical devices and providers of other information technology.\nIEC 80001 is the only standard that addresses how medical devices can be connected to IT networks to achieve interoperability without compromising the organization and delivery of health care.\nRead more here about IEC 80001-1:2021 PRV, Safety, effectiveness and security in the implementation and use of connected medical devices or connected health software - Part 1: Application of risk management."

        "content": "As we prepare to celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on February 11, it is increasingly acknowledged that standards are largely made by men for men. Women are under- represented in Technical Committees, and very few of them have become Chairs.\nThey also represent a tiny percentage inside the governing bodies of the IEC.\nA recent report published by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) highlights that standards fail to protect women as much as men, leading to a greater number of fatalities among women. But change is hopefully afoot.\nIEC is taking several measures to improve the situation. It has published a gender and diversity statement, and is part of the UNECE Gender Responsive Standards Initiative, which among other things, insists that organizations proactively implement a gender action plan as well as track progress, collecting and sharing data, success stories and good practices.\nNew awareness campaign\nThe IEC has also decided to launch a video campaign, #WomenatIEC, which kicks off on February 11. It will be shared on IEC social media platforms and the IEC Youtube channel.\n\nA special page has been created on the IEC website called Women in standardization where these videos plus various articles on gender and standards as well as reports and statements can be found.\nThe aim of the campaign is to empower women who are at the IEC but also to encourage more women to join the organization and to take part in National Committees, Technical Committees, Conformity Assessment Systems, etc. If the pool of women taking part is wider, then there is more of a chance that they will be recruited for the leadership positions as well.\nOne of the messages of the campaign is that the IEC welcomes more women to join at every level and that the women who have joined have all been able to make a significant contribution. The IEC has received more than 45 videos from women all around the world who make this organization thrive every day.\nA big thank you to all the women in the IEC community who took part!  \nVideos will be shared beyond March 8, which is International Women’s Day. The idea is for women and men to continue sharing these videos in their own social networks and to use the #WomenatIEC in important communications about gender or when there is an issue that can be related to this topic.\nThe hope is to start a Mexican wave of women communicating and using the campaign hashtag: #WomenatIEC.\nHappy International Day of Women and Girls in Science to all women in standardization."

        "content": "Around the world, industrial accidents involving explosions cause devastation. They take lives, damage property, infrastructure, affect economies and have a long-term impact on the environment.\nUnderground mines, offshore rigs and chemical plants are obvious examples, but explosions can happen wherever enough flammable liquids, vapours, gases or combustible dusts could start a fire or explosion, such as warehouses, grain storage silos, gas stations or sugar refineries.\nA recent example of this occurred in August 2020. A fire at a warehouse in the port of Beirut, Lebanon caused ammonium nitrate, which was not stored safely, to explode. The blast flattened most of the port and damaged many buildings across the city. Around 5000 injuries were reported, over 200 deaths and thousands were left homeless.\nThe need for a common framework\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) promotes sustainable development and economic prosperity through cooperation among its Member States.\nIts Working Party for Regulatory Cooperation and Standardization Policies, together with IEC and IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres, developed a Common Regulatory Objective (CRO) model for legislation in the sector of equipment used in environments with an explosive atmosphere in 2011.\nIt was important to establish a global approach for a global industry, to increase the safety of workers and communities that may be exposed to such explosions.\nIECEx assesses conformity to International Standards such as the IEC 60079 developed by IEC Technical Committee 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres and the ISO 80079 series. The standards identify explosive locations, classify the hazards, and design of equipment for safe use in such locations.\n“While international standards set out “standardized technical requirements” assurance that these Standards are actually met is demanded by all sectors of the community.  IECEx through its centralized and publicly accessible “online certificate system” provides that assurance”, said Chris Agius, Executive Secretary of IECEx.\nThe benefits of the CRO\nAny UN Member State that does not have a regulatory framework in the explosive equipment sector may use the model as an outline for legislation. However, the CRO can also be used by countries to align their existing national regulations with an internationally harmonized best practice.\nThe CROs are drawn up with reference to international standards and conformity assessment procedures developed by IEC and ISO and to best practices in the assessment of conformity to such standards, within IECEx. In short, use of International Standards supported by IECEx certification is considered the world’s best practice.\nMany UN Members States are also IEC members and use IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems.\nWhat does the CRO cover?\nThe CROs address the requirements both for electrical and mechanical equipment being placed on the market and for the safe installation and use of the equipment in the workplace.\nIt is based on the life-cycle approach, which requires proper inspection, maintenance and repair of explosion protected equipment, to give confidence that activities and processes involving or where flammable or combustible materials maybe present can continue safely.\nNational vs global\nIf countries use national regulations to test and certify equipment that is sold worldwide, it means that manufacturers may have to repeat testing and conformity assessment for each market.\nRequirements may differ from country to country, without necessarily ensuring better safety for workers and product end-users, while workers who move to different locations may not be familiar with diverse local safety procedures.\nAn internationally recognized certification scheme, such as IECEx, helps to reduce unnecessary costs resulting from duplication of testing and assessment and provides best practices for safety no matter where the equipment, facility or personnel are located.\nFind out more about IECEx"

Even more effective and easier to manage is biometric 2FA, which a growing number of organizations are implementing.\nBiometric security makes use of our unique physical characteristics and features, such as fingerprints, iris scanning, face and voice recognition. It is widely believed that biometrics will eventually replace passwords altogether.\nBiometric security offers a number of benefits. It is not only fast and convenient but also almost impossible to replicate.  \nBut just as passwords can be stolen, fingerprints and other biometric markers are also vulnerable to thieves for so-called ‘presentation attacks’. Unlike passwords, however, they cannot be changed, giving cybercriminals permanent access to any computer or electronic device requiring biometric authentication.\nInternational standards offer guidance based on best practices in industry, including the recently published ISO/IEC 19989 series.\nThe standard should be used in close conjunction with ISO/IEC 19792, the ISO/IEC 15408 series, and ISO/IEC 18045.

According to researchers, when given a picture of a prominent US congresswoman cropped below the neck, it autocompleted her wearing a bikini.\nThe study found that 43% of the time, the algorithm autocompleted men wearing suits. In contrast, it autocompleted women wearing swimsuits or low-cut tops 53% of the time.\nThe algorithm “learned” what people look like by studying a massive dataset of images from the internet. It is a worrying reflection of the prejudice that many people are experiencing in an increasingly digital world.\nIn our daily interactions with AI systems, we commonly encounter four kinds of bias.\n1. Stereotype bias\nWe see this, for example, in image recognition software that fails to identify non-white faces correctly. This kind of problem usually occurs when the scientists who train the data unwittingly introduce their own prejudices into their work.\n2 Sampling bias\nBiases can also occur when a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended statistical population are less likely to be included than others. A sampling bias could be introduced, for instance, if an algorithm used for medical diagnosis is trained only on data derived from one population.\nBias is not only about people, of course. For instance, if an algorithm meant to operate self-driving vehicles all year round is trained only on data collected during the summer months, falling snowflakes might confuse the system.\n3. Systematic value distortion\nSystematic value distortion occurs when the true value of a measurement is systematically overstated or understated. This kind of error usually occurs when there is a problem with the device or process used to make the measurements.\nOn a relatively simple level, measurement errors might occur if training data is captured on a camera that filters out some colours.\n4. Algorithmic bias\nAlgorithmic bias is what happens when a machine learning system reflects the opinions of the people who developed or trained it. For example, confirmation bias may be built into an algorithm if the aim, whether intentional or unintentional, is to prove an assumption or opinion.\nThere have been several high-profile cases of algorithmic bias in the field of corporate recruitment.\nIEC is a founding member of the Open Community for Ethics in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (OCEANIS). This global forum brings together organizations interested in the development and use of standards as a means to address ethical matters in autonomous and intelligent systems.\nIEC has also set up a group of its own to identify ethical issues and societal concerns relevant to its standardization work and other technical activities. In addition, the joint IEC and ISO technical committee develops standards for trustworthiness and other aspects of artificial intelligence.\n \n \nRead more\nEliminating data bias from machine learning systems"

        "content": "Research by the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant suggests that more than 80% of organizations have experienced a data breach as a result of security vulnerabilities in their supply chains. They are especially vulnerable because of their complex interactions with plant operations, employees, customers, and shippers, among others.\nIt can be difficult to know, let alone control, the security procedures that are in use along the supply chain. From a legal standpoint, this makes life very difficult for buyers, as they take the security practices of vendors into their own risk profiles.\nInternational standards and conformity assessment provide a security framework based on best practices and the consensus views of leading experts from around the world. It is of critical importance, though, to choose the right ones to mitigate the risks.\nIT systems, such as those found in government agencies or company headquarters, require different solutions to cyber-physical systems, such as the electric grid and other critical infrastructure, which uses operational technology (OT).\nIT vs OT\nThe growth of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has accelerated the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and OT. Cyber-physical systems are connected to an array of sensors and monitors that gather, analyse and communicate data with other devices and systems to improve output, quality, and consistency. The gains in efficiency come at a price, however, as increased connectivity creates a bigger attack surface for threat actors.\nIT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. In contrast, the priority for OT is availability. Shutting down — often the first line of defence for IT systems — is not an option for OT and in worse-case scenarios may threaten the safety of personnel or cause catastrophic damage to the environment.\nProtecting IT supply chains\nMost organizations can defend themselves by implementing an information management security system (ISMS), as described in ISO/IEC 27001. Another standard in the ISO/IEC 27000 family, the four-part publication ISO/IEC 27036, provides guidance on information security for third-party relationships.\nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the impact of attacks and their aftermath. In addition, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications.\nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nProtecting OT supply chains\nIEC 62443, is designed to keep cyber-physical systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors, for example.\nUsed together, IEC 62443-2-4, IEC 62443-3-3, IEC 62443-4-1, and IEC 62443-4-2 can provide an effective solution for industrial supply chains, especially when combined with the IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme. The industrial cyber security programme of the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector.\n \nRead more\nSecuring IT and OT supply chains with international standards and conformity assessment"

        "content": "On February 9, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) will be holding a webinar on the potential of mini-grids as providers of renewable energy for electricity access in remote areas and islands.\nThe event, Mini-grids of the future: renewables innovation and resiliency, will also highlight how IEC Standards are essential in helping to deploy them. “International standards, testing and licensing facilities are key to ensuring the high quality of deployed mini-grids”, says the Agency in its information material regarding the session.The organization will be presenting its report Quality Infrastructure for Smart Mini-Grids, which highlights the crucial role of QI for the development of smart renewable mini-grids. Grid-connected mini-grids can increase power system resilience and reliability, while facilitating the integration of solar and wind power. Renewable mini-grids far off the main grid, meanwhile, can provide reliable electricity access for remote areas and islands. According to UNDP, the biggest demand for direct current (DC) microgrids, outside providing electricity access to rural homes, is for local healthcare facilities.\nIEC Chair of the IEC Systems Committee on Low Voltage Direct Current and Low Voltage Direct Current for Electricity Access (SyC LVDC), Vimal Mahendru, one of the key speakers, will be making a presentation on the role played by the IEC in helping to implement renewable mini-grids of the future. Part of his presentation will focus on the systems approach taken by the IEC towards producing DC standards for mini-grids. He will report on the work of  a joint working group created between IEC Technical Committee 8, which, among many things,  prepares standards for the design and management of de-centralized electricity supply systems such as microgrids and systems for rural electrification, and SyC LVDC, which assesses standard voltages and power quality requirements for LVDC distribution.\nFor those wishing to attend, the seminar is free to access.

        "content": "IEC and ISO are making great progress to deliver a streamlined content development environment for standards developers. A core element of the online authoring tool is a structured content editing component, which facilitates the ability to work collaboratively on the same content, enhances content accuracy and quality, user guidance and version management, saves time and improves integration within existing IEC tools and services.\n“Our IT strategy includes delivering tools that not only simplify the work of standards developers, but also provide the foundations for creating innovative products and services for standards users. We're excited to be moving forward with online authoring as a key enabler of this strategy,” said Peter Godwin, IEC Director of IT Strategy and Operations. “Excellent cooperation with ISO also ensures harmonized implementation of new tools and processes for the two partner organizations,” he added.\nMember commenting\nWhile the technical committee pilot groups work on drafting their standards in the tool, the next phase of development for member commenting is beginning.\nIn the IEC Standards development process, once a draft has been finalized, it is submitted to all IEC members for comment and approval.\nThis commenting stage, where national committees submit their comments is an important step towards reaching consensus on the technical content.\n“For the technical committee, the current system involves working on three separate documents simultaneously: the original draft, a copy with the compilation of all comments and an updated draft which is based on the comments gathered. It is particularly challenging with long standards that have many comments and may require moving content around. In the new tool everything would be done in one document, which would save time and be much easier to manage,” said Christophe Boyer, IEC Technical Officer on the project, who has in-depth experience of the commenting process.\nBoyer notes that in the current process, a ‘compilation of comments’ document is produced which will need to be replicated in the new tool. He also stresses the importance of neutrality and to make sure that the tool does not allow national committees to see each others’ comments.\nTailored to specific needs\n“We are working hard to ensure that the authoring tool is tailored to our users’ requirements. The nature of the project enables us to incorporate direct feedback from the various user groups throughout the different phases of developing a standard,” said project manager Anja Bielfeld.\nFor the past two years, IEC has collaborated with ISO and CEN/CENELEC to develop the tool. The project began with an IEC reference group and an ISO external user group who together with IEC/ISO project managers, built and validated the tool. It was then made available to the technical committee pilot groups, who are currently using it to draft standards as well as make and resolve comments.\nFind out more about the online authoring tool"

        "content": "“A smart city is a city where improvements in quality of life, city services, sustainability and resilience are accelerated by the widespread and transformative use of data and technology,” says Michael Mulquin, who chairs the IEC Systems Committee for Smart Cities. Unfortunately, the vast amounts of data shared across connected devices and systems to achieve those ends bring an increased risk of cyber-attacks.\nAlthough the integration of digital technologies in smart cities enables data sharing and real-time analytics to improve services, from a cyber security perspective, the large quantity of personally identifiable information (PII), financial information and other critical business data can be enticing for hackers. \nSecurity breaches can also lead to essential services not operating properly. Several factors add complexity to the situation.\nThe growing use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and mobile networks are presenting hackers with ever-increasing potential doorways to data breaches. This carries myriad business, operational, reputational and litigation risks. \nA wide variety of both public and private stakeholders can be involved, as well as a wide variety of standards. Examples include privacy standards, smart city standards, cloud computing standards, IoT standards, data standards and IT governance standards. \nISO/IEC TS 27570 provides help on the use of standards while taking into account the wide variety of stakeholders in a smart city ecosystem. It makes recommendations on privacy protection and privacy guidelines for smart cities. \n“There are many different standards that can be used, including those for big data, cloud computing, IT governance and much more,” says Professor Kai Rannenberg, Convenor of the group of experts that developed the technical specification.\n“The key is knowing which one is most appropriate and how. ISO/IEC TS 27570 provides guidance on how to benefit from the standards available in the most effective way.”\nThe technical specification (TS) is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations, including public and private companies, government entities and not-for-profit organizations that provide services in smart city environments. It takes a multiple agency as well as a citizen-centric viewpoint. \nThe TS gives advice on smart city ecosystem privacy protection and how standards can be used at a global level and at an organizational level for the benefit of citizens. Also included are processes for smart city ecosystem privacy protection. \nISO/IEC TS 27570 is developed by the IEC and ISO technical committee on information security, cyber security and privacy protection."

        "content": "In an attempt to implement a new economic model that calls for the continual cycles of recovery and restoration of products and materials, known as a circular economy, data can serve an important role to assess circularity. Information on energy, material and waste can be used to better manage these resources as well as to find ways to reuse them.\nFor the electrotechnical industry, data related to material efficiency and the use of renewable sources for electricity are considered to be the most relevant. Material efficiency is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the preservation of materials, by making products more durable and repairable, and facilitates the recovery and recycling of material at the end of the product life.\nAccessing data\nAccording to IEC TC 111 expert Walter Jager, “There is a lot of information that is needed to really try and understand what level of circularity has been implemented on specific products or services.”\nHowever, the electrotechnical industry faces certain challenges in data collection and management given the complexity of the supply chain. As Jager remarks, “We are not just dealing with a product with a few different materials associated with it. Instead we have thousands and thousands of components and materials and products. Tracking all of this information with regard to the level of circularity that has been put into a product is a significant challenge.”\nHow standards can help\nGiven the large number of suppliers and the different components made up of different materials in the electrotechnical industry, standardized mechanisms will be needed.\nAccording to Jager, “We need to have standards that enable a common language to be used between the supplier and their customers in order to communicate that information. Without that kind of standardization, it is a huge effort to try and put that information together.”\nNext steps\nIn assessing circularity, it will be necessary to incorporate additional information into supply chain material declarations. This information will be needed not only to investigate the opportunities for improving material efficiency and circularity but also to assess the possible trade-offs that will likely occur in the design of products. For example, a balance may be necessary between durability and repairability when designing products and will likely depend on product application or other issues such as safety.\nA holistic approach may be necessary in order to assess the net impact on, for example, the environment, society and the economy. “You can't implement one aspect of circularity and then implement another aspect without considering that they may potentially be in conflict”, remarks Jager.\nRead the full article on e-tech."

        "content": "Ocean energy accounts for approximately 530 megawatts of installed generation capacity globally. Tidal stream and wave projects currently under construction may add another three gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity short-term within the next five years, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). \nMarine energy converter (MEC) devices are used to capture wave energy and convert it into electricity. Often such devices are situated in challenging environments in which water currents and windy weather can displace them from their intended location.\nIECRE testing and certification \nMooring fixtures are crucial for securing MECs to the seabed. When choosing the right mooring, a number of aspects must be considered, such as the water depth and currents, type of seabed the mooring will be attached to and the type of line and how much stretch it will give as it floats under the water.\nOne way to ensure MECs and all their components function correctly is to test and certify them. IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, offers testing and certification for the marine, solar photovoltaic and wind energy sectors, to IEC International Standards.\nAndrew Hunt is a Technical Associate who carries out mooring inspections at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), which was designated as the first IECRE renewable energy testing laboratory (RETL) for the marine sector in 2020.\nInstilling trust in industry\nHunt notes that a crucial part of the process concerns data collection, “When we reach the phase of an assessment where we have been given the data, we must do an audit to ensure we are seeing true data and that we have done a robust job.”\nData for inspection purposes comes in a variety of formats. For example, project documentation (technical design reports, calibration certificates, GA drawings etc) and photographic and video of actual eyes on inspections have had to be carried out remotely where practicable using a video link because of COVID-19.\nAs more marine energy devices and equipment are developed, increasingly customers see the benefit of IECRE testing and certification.\n“We recognized the importance of the quality of the data to be collected from our offshore test campaign. We were delighted to draw on the technical expertise of the EMEC team in the development of the data collection methodology, and the oversight of its implementation. As result we’ve captured a high quality, independently verified data set that will be foundation for all future development”, said Darren Hayes from Dublin Offshore.\nRead the full interview in e-tech magazine and learn more about IECRE, the international standards developed by IEC Technical Committee 114 for marine energy, wave, tidal and other water current converters, and EMEC."

        "content": "While COVID-19 vaccine campaigns are underway in most Western and high-income nations, concerns are increasingly voiced about vaccination against the virus in the developing world. Many fear that protecting these populations will not be a priority, especially as such large sums of money are involved.\nUNICEF, together with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), is leading efforts to supply approved COVID-19 vaccines for 92 low and lower to middle income countries, of which one quarter are in West and Central Africa.\nThe organizations must ensure the vaccines are kept at a stable, cold temperature from the moment they leave the manufacturer until they are administered. “West and Central Africa is one of the most complex environments you will find,” Jean-Cedric Meeus, UNICEF’s Chief of Supply for the region is quoted as saying on the organization’s website. “We are dealing with the challenge of delivering COVID-19 vaccines to major cities, but also to extremely remote villages. We are preparing for all scenarios.”\nLack of access to electricity in these remote areas makes the challenge even more difficult to meet. Since 2008, UNICEF has been delivering and installing 20,000 solar powered fridges all over the region, so as be able to store vaccines at local health centres or facilities.The fridges can store at below zero temperatures, which are not low enough for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine but could be used for other COVID-19 vaccines.\nIEC standards are crucial\nStandards help to ensure that this essential equipment meets the required safety and performance indicators – allowing populations to trust they are provided with the appropriate equipment. IEC prepares numerous standards for renewable energy systems, from wind to solar, both on-grid and off-grid. IEC Technical Committee 82, for instance, issues a series of technical specifications (TS) which make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification. The standards series has been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).\nIEC TC 61 publishes standards on the safety aspects relating to most electronic appliances, including fridges. One if its subcommittees prepares international safety standards for refrigerators, freezers and similar appliances used in homes, supermarkets, hospitals, transportation, manufacturing, etc. SC 61C has recently published IEC 60335-2-64 which provides the requirements for refrigerating appliances and ice-makers."

A commented version of the standard is available, highlighting all changes from the previous edition as well as providing comments explaining the most relevant changes. The commented version is meant to make use of the standard easier for all stakeholders.\nThe new edition is published by IEC SC 31J, a subcommittee of IEC Technical Committee 31 which prepares international standards relating to the use of equipment, including area classification, the selection and installation, inspection and maintenance, repair, overhaul and reclamation of equipment where there is a hazard due to the possible presence of explosive atmospheres of gases and vapours or combustible dusts.\nIEC 60079-10-1 sets out the essential criteria for the classification of areas where there may be a fire or explosion risk due the possible presence of flammable gas or vapour. The standard provides guidance on factors and parameters relevant to such assessments.\nWhile the standard is primarily intended to aid in the selection and installation of equipment to prevent ignition sources in areas with explosion risks it is also a useful adjunct for other plant safety issues.\nThis new edition sets out more clearly the factors relevant to the classification of hazardous areas, helps avoid ambiguities and makes the standard more user-friendly.\nIt provides the basic principles for hazardous area classification and recognizes numerous national or industry codes that may provide further detail or specific examples of hazardous area classification. It also includes a number of simplified assessment tools for use in applications where the use of such tools is considered an acceptable option.\nThe standard is meant for engineers in a wide range of industries such as mining, oil and gas, petroleum distribution, petrochemical, printing, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, adhesives and paint manufacturing and many others. It is also a reference standard for many government agencies related to workplace safety and safe management of these types of industries.\nOnce the hazardous area is classified according to IEC 60079-10-1 the selection and installation of equipment to be considered safe in the area is covered by other parts of the IEC 60079 series and ISO/IEC 80079 series such as IEC 60079-14 and ISO/IEC 80079-36. To make sure that equipment used in hazardous areas meets the very strict requirements specified in these international standards.

        "content": "An Israeli company says it has developed batteries for electric two-wheeler vehicles that are capable of fully charging in five minutes. The company claims that the new lithium-ion (li-ion) battery has moved beyond the research phase and is ready for mass production.\nThe company has distributed 1000 batteries to EV manufacturers for testing. If it proves safe and reliable, the new li-ion battery could herald a major breakthrough for electric vehicles, eventually making them almost as fast to charge as filling up petrol or diesel vehicles.\nWhen they are charging or discharging, lithium ions move between the positive and negative electrodes, called cathodes and anodes. Although they have the best power to weight ratio, existing li-ion batteries are prone to overheating and short-circuiting, especially during fast charging.\nThe developers of the new battery have tackled this problem by replacing the graphite in the negative electrode with semiconductor nanoparticles into which ions can pass more quickly and easily.\nIn recent years, battery technology has hit the headlines because of the flammable properties of li-ion. In 2018, batteries provoked fires in more than utilities in South Korea alone.\nIEC TC 21 is one of several IEC technical committees preparing standards for cells and batteries. The TC’s work is divided into two distinct areas covering different battery technologies.\nSubcommittee 21A has the task of preparing standards for batteries with alkaline electrolyte, such as NiCad or nickel–metal-hydride, and TC 21 focuses on batteries with acid electrolyte called lead-acid. Both share the work on lithium-ion batteries.\nTC 21 is responsible for a number of important standards, including IEC 62660-2, which is part of the IEC 62660 series on secondary Li-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs.\nIEC 62660 has three different parts: the first deals with performance testing, the second with reliability tests and the third with safety requirements. The purpose of IEC 62660-2 is to provide a basic reliability and abuse testing methodology for Li-ion cells which can be used in a diverse range of automobile battery packs and systems.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four CA systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances, etc. of batteries, chargers and charging stations.\nThe growing popularity of EVs, as well as of electrical energy storage needs for the renewable energy sector, smart grid applications and the rapid growth of the portable devices market, are an important driver for innovation and underline the importance of the secondary battery sector.\nTo sustain growth, IEC TC 21 and SC 21A will ensure that equipment manufacturers using secondary batteries have safe and dependable products available and will continue to prepare new as well as update existing international standards in a burgeoning sector."

In hospitals, they have been used to clean and disinfect rooms, help monitor patients and provide delivery services. As workers stay home, automation has increased. Robots have been used to help with retail inventory by stocking shelves and identifying inventory gaps.\nE-commerce have also indicated an interest in the use of autonomous delivery of their products. For example, preliminary use of drones and robots have been tested by companies such as UPS, Amazon and CVS.\nDigital health\nAs health became a foremost concern in 2020, digital health services expand to fulfil demands from health-conscious individuals and healthcare providers. Individuals sought tools that allowed them to become more aware of their health while doctors and healthcare providers have been able to keep closer contact with their patients and improve their efficiencies.\nMoving forward, Koenig and Rohrbaugh predict that the future innovation in digital health will include the use of robots as triage helpers in hospitals, the use of artificial intelligence for diagnosis and the use of virtual and augmented realities in medicine.\n5G\nThe roll-out of 5G services continues around the world. According to research by IHS Markit, 5G investment is up 10.8% over the 2019 forecast. \nEnthusiasm for 5G remains high. It remains an essential technology for IoT devices and will drive advances in areas such as healthcare by allowing for the development of complex solutions that require significant computing capability on the edge of the network.\nSmart cities\nWhile many continue to work and learn from home, planning is underway on the post-COVID future. As Koenig and Rohrbaugh note, out of crisis, comes opportunity. Technologies such data dashboards, smart kiosks, networked sensors and contract tracing have been used extensively in the past year and may find new applications in the future.\nAs employees return to their workplaces, they may find smarter and safer environments. This may include touchless and voice enabled technologies as well as tools that allow for remote collaboration. Hybrid solutions will likely embrace a combination of both on-site and remote meetings.\nStandards support innovation\nCES offers an exciting opportunity to witness innovation in technology. Innovation, however, relies upon standards which provide the necessary backbone on which innovation can be built. They offer the tools to ensure the safety, security, interoperability and performance of products and services.\nEach year, the IEC publishes over 700 international standards, technical specifications and reports that support the electrical, electronic and information technologies."

        "content": "It is only the power of hindsight that allows us to grasp the full significance of breakthroughs in science and technology. The first powered flight, for example, lasted only 12 seconds and covered less than 40 metres. We can appreciate the contribution of the Wright brothers nowadays because aircraft have become a fact of modern life.\nThat is why it is not easy to understand the importance of quantum supremacy, which a US technology giant and a Chinese university claim to have achieved in 2020. The challenge is broadly defined as using quantum computers to solve problems that today’s computers cannot.\nThese were two highly contrived experiments – respectively, calculating the randomness of a series of numbers and checking the distribution of photons – that may seem no more impressive to us than staying in the air for a matter of seconds must have appeared in 1903. They do, however, bring us slightly closer to a future, perhaps 10 or 15 years away, when quantum information science looks likely to open many new opportunities.\nMajor corporations and some universities are already investing millions to buy or develop their own quantum computers. Many more are benefitting from cloud-based quantum computers.\nThis is despite the fact that quantum computers are prone to errors that limit the size and complexity of problems that quantum computers are currently able to tackle. The major challenge is that quantum bits, known as  qubits, are highly sensitive to external ‘noise’.\nQubits work in a very different way to the bits in traditional computers, which have two states – either on or off – represented as a 1 or a 0. Qubits have more states which are changing continuously. Qubits can be on, off or somewhere in between all at the same time.\nQubits only function “coherently” when they are cooled down to mere thousandths of a degree above absolute zero, which also protects them from the destabilizing effects of radiation, light, sound, vibrations and magnetic fields.\nAlthough, the technology is still in its infancy, IEC and ISO have set up a working group (WG 14) in their joint technical committee on information technology (JTC1). It is hoped that standardization work, beginning with a foundation of common vocabularies and best practices,  can play an important role in helping to transform the promise of quantum computing into practice. \nIt will help the businesses and universities undertaking research and development work by enabling developers to focus their attention on higher-level challenges, rather than starting projects from scratch.\nIt also reflects IEC strategy to identify and respond to emerging (and potentially disruptive) technology developments, as well as to market and social trends.\n \nRead more\nFive things everyone should know about quantum computing"

        "content": "Imagine the scene: a young woman takes a motorized scooter to cover the short distance from her home to the office. It is a common enough sight on the streets and pavements of cities around the world nowadays, but this young woman was using her scooter to get to work in 1916.\nLady Florence Norman, the British socialite and suffragette, was an early adopter of the Autoped, a foldable motor scooter manufactured by a company in New York. By 1935, the American aviator, Amelia Earhart was using an electric model of the same scooter to make her way around airdromes.\nAt the height of its popularity, the Autoped was issued to traffic cops in the US and the New York Postal Service used it to deliver the mail.\nThey would have been able to reach speeds of over 30 kilometres an hour (20 mph), using the handlebars and steering column to control the scooter, with a lever on the handlebar for the throttle. Pulling the handlebars and column back would apply the brake.\nThey fell out of favour for a variety of reasons, partly economic and partly related to new traffic regulations around the world designed to make roads and pavements safer.\nA century later, motorized scooters are once again a popular way to cover distances too far to walk and not far enough to warrant the hassle of driving or taking the bus. That is why the IEC has a new technical committee, TC 125, to provide standardization in the areas of safety and reliability, protection against hazards, docking stations, recharging and recycling.\nThey are developing standards for electrically powered transport devices with one or more wheels, where the speed or steering is controlled electronically. It includes electric scooters and monocycles, but excludes electric bicycles, motor bikes or cars since they are already addressed by other technical committees.\nStandards will only apply for devices used on public roads and spaces. Issues being addressed include:\n\nTerminology of the different personal e-transporters\nReliability of the speed control (acceleration and braking) and steering\nDefinitions of the different safety and reliability levels based on the maximum speed of the device and, subsequently, the different safety precautions\nRequirements regarding visibility depending on where the device is used, including requirements to use lights, horns or reflectors\nProtection against hazards such as fire and water\nRequirements for recharging and public docking stations\nMethods for testing safety requirements"

Less travel expenses for journos covering the show, but less income as well for the well-known event. Its challenge will be to draw attention in the same way by giving center stage to the latest technology trends.\nOne of the much hyped gadgets mentioned in the press around the show is transparent TV sets. The television industry has been one of the great winners of the Covid-induced confinement, with sales up everywhere, as people fork out on the best TV sets around.\nTransparent and bended screens are one of this year's CES hot topics, with a well known Korean manufacturer showing its 40% transparent screens put to use in bedrooms, on the windows of underground trains and in sushi bars: you can use the screen to order a menu and then have a TV programme shown while you are waiting for your food.\nIEC is preparing standards in these new development areas. One of the IEC Technical Committees, IEC TC 110, prepares standards for electronic displays, including OLED, 3D and holographic as well as flexible.\nIEC TC 100 develops standards for audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment, and ISO/IEC joint Technical Committee  (JTC 1) publishes international standards for information technology. One of the JTC 1 subcommittees, SC 29 specializes in standardization for the efficient coding of digital representations of images, audio and moving pictures, and has been awarded several Emmys for its work."

        "abstract": "The IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy.",
        "content": "The IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy. It consists of the following: using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for better performance, or improving the conversion of energy into electricity.\nMany energy efficient technologies and solutions are readily available. Investments and a commitment towards energy efficiency abound, yet a number of barriers inhibits the deployment of energy efficiency solutions. Lack of awareness of saving potential, a focus on devices rather than systems which leads to a lower return on investment and a preference for lower cost rather than life-cycle gains are some of the barriers that impede harvesting the full potential of energy efficiency.\nStandardization can offer solutions to help overcome these barriers by, for example, providing definitions and measurements of performance, disseminating and promoting energy efficiency technologies and establishing minimum energy performance requirements.\nThe IEC has set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) to help IEC technical committees adopt energy efficient solutions in their standardisation activity and support energy efficient technologies through their standards. According to ACEE Chair Philippe Vollet, “our first mission is to coordinate activities related to energy efficiency and provide guidance to technical committees”.\nAs part of this mission, IEC ACEE has developed two guides, Guide 118 and Guide 119, which can be used by IEC technical committees to harmonize energy efficiency standardization and adopt a systems approach. It has also developed a case- study on how international standards can be used to support the energy efficiency market and national energy efficiency policies for low-voltage electrical installations\nLow-voltage electrical installations case study\nThe case study on low-voltage electrical installations is based on IEC 60364-8-1 which gives guidance on the design and assessment of low-voltage electrical installations based on the concepts found in IEC Guide 118.\nAccording to Jacques Peronnet, member of IEC ACEE and Chair of IEC TC 64, “IEC 60364-8-1 provides a method to assess the energy efficiency of an electrical installation based on parameters that influence efficiency. It is relevant for both new and existing buildings and can be used for industrial, commercial and residential premises.”\nBoundaries need to be defined in order to understand what will be addressed in the optimization of energy usage. Circuits that are designed for energy optimization are known as meshes and generally refer to a zone in the building such as the floor or a room and a type of usage such as lighting or HVAC. Meshes are optimized to ensure the lowest energy consumption and cost in comparison with another solution.\nDesign aspects such as the availability of local energy generation and storage as well as the arrangement of circuits need to be considered. The external driving parameters include factors that have an impact on energy usage such as building occupancy, the seasons of year - such as winter or summer when electricity demands are higher - and the cost of the electricity.\nMeasurements are needed to assess the efficiency of a building and provide awareness about consumption. Examples of measurement tools include billing and energy usage analysis such as power meters.\nAs noted by Peronnet, “Buildings represent 40% of global energy demands of which a significant part is supplied by electricity. Finding ways to make energy usage more efficient can contribute greatly to a huge energy saving.”"

        "content": "The year 2020 upended many aspects of our lives that had previously been taken for granted. New norms for working, learning and socializing emerged which, as a consequence, resulted in an acceleration towards digitization. And while the year started with a global pandemic, it has ended with the availability of a new vaccine.\nFor the IEC community, the year entailed working from home, hours of online meetings and the first virtual IEC General Meeting. Yet, despite the move to an all-digital environment, IEC standardization and conformity assessment activities carried on.\nBelow, we have listed the top stories on the IEC blog for each month of the year. As you will see from the list, Covid-19 did not consume our news feed. Rather, interest remained high for new standards published, the work of conformity assessment and the trends that will impact the future.\nJanuary: A process for refurbishing medical devices\nMaximizing the value of medical equipment by reusing it can be one way of reducing costs. The IEC has recently published a new standard IEC 63077,  that defines a systematic process for refurbishing used medical imaging equipment.\nFebruary: Introducing the new IEC General Secretary and CEO\nThe IEC is pleased to welcome Philippe Metzger as its new General Secretary and CEO. Metzger brings to the IEC his deep understanding of technology, as well as leadership experience managing a public institution and a vision for the continued relevance of standards and conformity assessment in today’s rapidly changing world.\nMarch: Can AI be used to fight the COVID-19 virus?\nAdvances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, could help to provide solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using AI tools such as machine learning and data analytics, researchers can help to track outbreaks, detect illness and eventually secure a treatment.\nApril: How IEC 61850 Standards remain ahead of the game\nAmong the IEC most cutting-edge standards, the IEC 61850 series paves the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They are widely considered to be among the core international standards for the smart grid.\nMay: Automating substations\nThe IEC is working on a new standard which aims to define the configuration languages required to achieve digital substations, including the human machine interface (HMI) applications. The planned document, which is currently being drafted, will be part of the IEC 61850 series of publications, which includes some of the core international standards used for integrating digital communication processes into the electrical grid.\nJune: IEC issues standard to test how well PV modules resist snow\nAccording to the Global Energy Review 2020 report published by IEA, solar photovoltaics (PV) accounts for the fastest growing renewable energy source. In 2019, one-fifth of all renewable capacity deployed globally consisted of individuals and small businesses installing solar PV modules on their roofs.\nJuly: IECRE approves first customer testing facility for wind turbine blades\nMany countries are working towards reducing their CO2 emissions in a bid to become carbon neutral. Denmark is a world leader in wind energy. Last year it sourced almost half of its power from wind (47%) according to Energinet, the country’s grid operator. Offshore accounted for 18% and onshore 29%.\nAugust: Experts responsible for JPEG standards tackle ‘fake’ media\nIEC, ISO and ITU experts are evaluating the use of standards to address the growing emergence of ‘fake’ media. Unlike the murky world of fake news, the intentions behind fake media can be either good or bad. The term ‘fake’ can be applied to any manipulated media.\nSeptember: IEC now offers standards with technical commentary\nIn response to market demand, IEC is now offering new editions of its most popular standards with comments by technical experts. Known as Commented Versions (CMV), these publications provide commentary on the major changes between the new edition of the standard and the previous one.\nOctober: The need for a global standard on e-waste\nAccording to the global e-waste monitor 2020, in 2019, the world generated a striking 53,6 Mt of electrical and electronic waste, an average of 7,3 kg per capita. The global generation of e-waste grew by 9,2 Mt since 2014 and is projected to grow to 74,7 Mt by 2030 – almost doubling in only 16 years.\nNovember: IEC publishes a white paper on the future of safety\nThe IEC has published a new white paper, Safety in the future, which examines the topic of safety in the new digital environment. It references current social trends and initiatives, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as various real-life examples that are pioneering innovative safety solutions for the future.\nDecember: Terminology standard for the IoT\nThe first Technical Committee of the IEC is responsible for publishing and maintaining that most essential tool used by all IEC TCs when preparing standards, the Electropedia, also known as the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)."

        "content": "The international standard, IEC 62368-1, takes a hazard-based approach to the safety of electrical and electronic devices. It also makes it easier to introduce new technologies to the marketplace.\nIEC 62368-1 is applicable to the safety of electrical and electronic equipment within the field of audio, video, information and communication technology, and business and office machines with a rated voltage not exceeding 600 V. It does not include requirements for performance or functional characteristics of equipment.\nThe technology independent standard manages to cover a broad range of products as the requirements are performance-based rather than prescriptive. This approach to safety standards has become increasingly necessary as devices become smarter, more complex and portable, typically merging audio video technologies with information and communications technology.\nThe standard’s focus on energy safety gives manufacturers greater freedom to explore hardware technologies and will have a major impact on the design of new products. The main hazards are: electric shock; electrically caused fire; hazardous substances (chemical exposure); mechanical (stability, sharp edges, moving parts); thermal burns (hot surfaces); and radiation (laser, ionizing, acoustic).\nIEC 62368-1 clearly identifies potentially hazardous energy sources in order to put safeguards into place. It defines a safeguard as a device or scheme or system that either is interposed between a hazardous energy source and a body part, or that prevents hazardous energy from transferring to or from a body part.\nThe standard recognizes that the evolution of energy sources is inevitable. For this reason, it requires engineers to identify energy sources and to assign them to one of three relevant classes: one is for sources that are detectable without pain to users, two for those that cause pain on exposure and three for energy sources that cause injury when a transfer mechanism is present.\nThe general idea is that safeguards should reflect the capability of the user and evolve in line with developments in energy sources. The standard identifies three kinds of user, called Ordinary Person, Instructed Person and Skilled Person, who have different needs and face different challenges. It aims to boost safety for all three.\nIEC 62368-1 is the work of IEC Technical Committee 108, which was set up with the responsibility of developing safety Standards for electronic devices in the areas of audio/video, and ICT. It merged the work areas covered by TC 92 (audio/video and electronic equipment for household use) and TC 74 (data processing equipment)."

        "content": "The smart city Peachtree Corners has unveiled a new 18-mile solar roadway system that is expected to generate more than 1 300 kilowatt hours of electricity each year. This electricity will be used to power an electric vehicle charging station at city hall.\nAccording to Brandon Branham, chief technology officer for Peachtree Corners, “While this new form of 100% green, renewable energy will begin with supplying power to an EV charging station, our vision is to begin to power more existing infrastructure across the city, off-grid. We look forward to installing more panels throughout, which may include sidewalks, bike lanes and many more surfaces.”\nEnergy harvested from roads captures unused ambient energy and converts it to electric power. This electricity can then be used to power road infrastructure such as lights and signals. It can be stored in batteries for use when needed or fed into the electric power grid. And, because it makes use of the existing road network, no new land space needs to be allocated.\nInternational Standards play a key role in the development of these solutions. IEC Technical Committee 47 develops International Standards for semiconductor devices including those that harvest energy. Batteries used to store electrical energy rely on the standardization work of IEC TC 21. IEC TC 8 and its Subcommittee 8A develop Standards for electricity supply systems, including the integration of power generated from renewable energy sources and fed into the electrical grid. The systems group SyC Smart Energy provide systems level standardization, coordination and guidance in the areas of smart grid and smart energy.\nHowever, installing glass modules on roadways is no easy feat. Car tyres must be able to grip the road surface and glass panels must be durable and capable of withstanding heavy weights. Shading from trees, buildings and clouds can reduce exposure to the sun. \nDespite these challenges, several companies have developed photovoltaic modules that can either replace asphalt or be placed directly on top of existing roadways. While these solutions are proprietary, they rely on International Standards developed by IEC TC 82, which is responsible for solar photovoltaic energy systems."

According to a recent survey from the Ponemon Institute, the cost of so-called insider threats has increased by 31%, from $8.76 million in 2018 to $11.45 million in 2020.\nThe report identifies lack of training as a major contributor to security breaches. It claims that training could, for example, ensure that employees acquire a better understanding of regulatory requirements related to their work.\nTraining could help employees to ensure that the devices they use are always secured. Other bad workplace practices identified in the report include sending confidential documents to unsecured cloud locations and breaking security policies in order to simplify tasks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation with the increase in remote working. Many home networks lack security measures such as antivirus software, customized firewall and online backup tools.\nThis increases the risk of negligent personnel unwittingly helping malware to infect devices and gain access to corporate networks. A new edition of a well-known international standard addresses many of these challenges.\nISO/IEC 27014, Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – Governance of information security\nISO/IEC 27014 outlines an efficient governance model designed to ensure that practices and procedures are properly maintained. It features new information and has been updated to improve both clarity and structure.\nThe 2020 edition, which has been more closely aligned to ISO/IEC 27001, defines cyber security governance as the “means by which an organization’s governing body provides overall direction and control of activities that affect the security of an organization’s information.”\nISO/IEC 27014 recommends training and awareness programmes to establish a positive information security culture. It also suggests roles and responsibilities for executive management and boards of directors in all types and sizes of organizations.\nThe objectives of the standard are to “align security programme and business objectives and strategies, deliver value to stakeholders and the board, and ensure information risks are adequately managed”.\nThe standard defines six overarching governance principles, which are defined as “accepted rules for governance action or conduct that act as a guide for the implementation of governance”:\n\nestablish organization-wide information security\nmake decisions using a risk-based approach\nset the direction of investment decisions\nensure conformance with internal and external requirements\nfoster a security-positive culture\nensure the security performance meets current and future requirements\n\nMany IEC International Standards and all the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16, which promotes peaceful and inclusive societies. The cyber security standards in the  contribute by protecting key data and systems, while others, such as help make critical infrastructure more resilient."

        "content": "Friends,\nAs many of us look forward to the festive period and the end of 2020, few of us could have contemplated how devastating the end of the second decade and beginning of the third in the new millennium would be.\nFor some this year has seen the premature loss of loved ones and for others they themselves have suffered the ravages of the coronavirus.\nMy hope for us all is that our world becomes a safe place in 2021, where better health returns to us all and our fragile global economy sees the early green shoots of renewal.  Despite the news in the written media, and on our mobile devices, we have perhaps an opportunity to accelerate the development and deployment of our various renewable technologies to help make our world a kinder, friendlier and more environmentally acceptable place.\nMay I wish you and your families and friends the season’s greetings and a healthy and happy and prosperous new year whenever it comes to you.\n2020 has been a year of change in so many different ways and our System has been no different in that regard and has also seen many changes, especially as we conclude the first year of our new structure with one decision making forum of the REMC.  As we know our REMC was of necessity held remotely this year and I’m especially grateful to you all for the way in which you participated during the meeting and for your support in dealing with items by exception.  My earnest hope is that we will be able to meet face to face in 2021 and renew those important business and professional relationships which are essential to the efficient operation of all that we seek to do.  I know for some that we were not able to have as full and frank discussions on some matters as we have in the past so again my thanks for your understanding.\nNo doubt 2021 will be another year of change as the world of renewables is thankfully a fast moving and dynamic sector.  I am excited about the new opportunities we have in the PV Sector and look forward to discussions on the Rating concept.  For Marine we have our first Test Laboratory – the first of many I hope and I know extensive discussions are ongoing as to what form Marine conformity assessment will take in the coming years.  In Wind we still have a very healthy number of organisations wishing to participate and develop their scope and in 2021 we start the first cycle of reassessments.\nWe have much to look forward to – we have all learned much in 2020 on how to work more efficiently and effectively which can only be a positive as we look forward to new challenges in 2021.\nAs Chair, I look forward to further engagement with CAB – our Conformity Assessment Board and the exciting changes in IEC governance.\nI would urge you all to reach out to each other and support our new endeavours as we seek to develop the System and for you to reach out to me – whether you believe we are doing the right thing or would like to see a different or new agenda, please let us know.  Without your feedback we live in a vacuum and do not reach our own or the Systems full potential.\nIn closing my best wishes to you all and my thanks for all your comments, responses and discussions which I sincerely hope to continue in the New Year and beyond.\nFor many of us 2020 has seen us move beyond what we are comfortable with and I’ve been struck by this quote from Neale Donald Walsch:\n‘Life begins at the end of your comfort zone’\nTake care\nAl"

        "content": "A series of cyber-attacks has been sweeping across the United States in recent days, targeting federal agencies and a major cyber security agency that has contracts with the government and Fortune 500 companies. Analysts suspect another country is behind the security breaches.\nGovernment agencies and most private businesses can defend themselves by implementing an information management security system (ISMS), as described in ISO/IEC 27001. The well-known international standard defines a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology.\nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nIn addition, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nCyber physical systems, including the power grid and industrial plants face a different challenge. Cyber physical systems are smart systems that integrate computational components, engineering, networking and physical process.\nThe power grid, for example, is a physical system with an information infrastructure overlaid on it, which is a cyber system. This makes cyber physical systems quite different from just plain computers, which IT typically deals with.\nUnfortunately, those responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as energy, health, manufacturing, or transport. From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that unlike business systems, industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nThat is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk. Where IT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad” — for cyber physical systems availability is of foremost importance. Priorities for cyber physical environments focus on health and safety and protecting the environment.\nIn the event of an emergency, in order to be able to protect personnel or to minimize the impacts of natural disasters, it is therefore vital that operators can receive accurate and timely information and can quickly take appropriate actions, such as shutting off power or shifting to backup equipment.\nSupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are used to oversee electric grids as well as plant and machinery in industrial installations, can now have widespread communication networks. They reach, directly or indirectly, into thousands of facilities, with increasing threats (both deliberate and inadvertent) potentially causing serious harm to people and to equipment.\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges. For example, IEC 62443, is designed to keep cyber physical systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.\nThe industrial cybersecurity programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cybersecurity in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series."

        "abstract": "A document on testing rationales could be used by  most IEC Technical Committees when developing testing standards.",
        "content": "The IEC 60099 Standards are widely used across the electricity transmission and distribution industry and specify several performance and safety tests for a variety of different surge arresters. These indispensable devices are used to protect electrical equipment from over-voltage transients caused by external events such as lightning or internal switching.\nAn IEC group, responsible for maintaining the test standards for high-voltage metal oxide surge arrester standards, is working on the publication of a ground-breaking document, named “Type Test Rationales” , which aims to rationalize the testing process and make it more economical for both manufacturers and users.\nThe idea behind the document is to examine all the existing tests and weed out the unnecessary ones, some of which have become obsolete over time, by way of a formal procedure. This should enable companies and users to save a considerable amount of time and money. More than that, according to IEC expert Frédérick Dubé, “if you know exactly why you do a test and why you do it according to a specific procedure, it helps you to interpret the test results, enabling users to accept certain deviations from the specifications. It also allows the industry to project itself in the long-term. If some tests need to be modified in the future, or a new family of products needs to be tested, it is much easier to integrate them into existing standards using a document which sets test rationales\".\nThe test rationales would include a sample selection rationale, a test procedure rationale, explaining why the procedure is relevant to the test, and an evaluation rationale.This third section would be required to clarify why the test is evaluated in such a manner and why it is important to the product in its real-life application. Each test rationale also includes useful additional information such as historical notes explaining the evolution of this test over time in past revisions of the standards.\n“We are looking into the possibility of releasing the test rationales as an IEC Technical Report. We have completed around 50% of the work that would go into such a document. The alternative would be to include it in the new edition of IEC 60099-4, which would take more time,” says Jonathan Woodworth, Co-Convenor of the group.\nAccording to Frédérick Dubé, the document on test rationales has the potential to become a widely used reference tool inside the IEC. “In my opinion, these rationales could be used for almost every IEC test Standard. They could either be directly added to some short standard documents or referred to for other test publications. Such a document is also very enriching in that it helps to transfer expertise from more experienced members to new members of the IEC\".\nBoth are very keen to explain the work they are doing on test rationales and would be able to share a presentation with those interested.

Though many benefits come with AI technologies, there are also some concerns, including the legal ramifications we should be considering.\nFor instance, AI systems use vast amounts of data, which raises questions such as who owns the data shared between AI developers and users? Can data be sold? Should this shared data be de-identified to protect privacy concerns? Is the intended use of data appropriately disclosed and compliant with legislation?\nWhat if machine learning used to make complex decisions based on the data it operates on results in an undesired outcome, who is responsible, the programmer, user or the technology itself? \nAgainst this backdrop, an AI webinar series was held on 8 December. The event was organized by the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Intellectual Property Training Center (GCC), with international and regional participation from IEC, WIPO and GSO.\n“Transformative technologies like artificial intelligence, big data and analytics will change how we live, work and play for years to come.

        "content": "In 2015, the European Commission adopted an ambitious Action Plan to transition towards a circular economy. As part of this plan, the Commission called on European standardization organizations – CEN-CENELEC and ETSI – to develop standards to help enable this transformation. Specifically, its implementing decision M/543, requested the development of standards that address material efficiency aspects in the design of energy-related products.\nMaterial efficiency consists of the conservation of materials by making products more durable, resource-efficient and facilitates the reuse or recycling of parts and/or materials at the end of life. While regulators had focused previously on ensuring the energy efficiency of products, attention is now shifting towards material usage and preservation.\nWork of CEN-CENELEC JTC 10\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 10 published a series of eight standards that provide the general principles to consider when addressing material efficiency in energy-related products. These are horizontal guidance documents that focus on durability, remanufacture, repair, recyclability, reused components, recycled content, critical raw materials and information. They are as follows:\n\nEN 45552:2020 ‘General method for the assessment of the durability of energy-related products’;\nEN 45553:2020 ‘General method for the assessment of the ability to remanufacture energy-related products’\nEN 45554:2020 ‘General methods for the assessment of the ability to repair, reuse and upgrade energy-related products’;\nEN 45555:2019 ‘General methods for assessing the recyclability and recoverability of energy-related products’;\nEN 45556:2019 ‘General method for assessing the proportion of reused components in energy-related products’;\nEN 45557:2020 ‘General method for assessing the proportion of recycled material content in energy-related products’;\nEN 45558:2019 ‘General method to declare the use of critical raw materials in energy-related products’;\nEN 45559:2019 ‘Methods for providing information relating to material efficiency aspects of energy-related products’.\n\nIn a recent CEN-CENELEC webinar providing information about these standards, Jens Giegerich, a member of the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Affairs (ACEA) and the Convenor of CEN-CLC/JTC 10 WG2 and WG5 explained that “three top level aims of the European Commission are to extend product life, have the ability to reuse components and recycled materials and to facilitate the reuse of these materials and components. These aims are supported with the new standards.”\nThese standards are applicable to energy-related products as defined by the European Commission in its Eco-Design Directive which covers more than 40 product groups and places mandatory environmental requirements regarding their energy efficiency and design. As noted by Giegerich, “it is now the responsibility of the technical committees for the product and product groups to develop the relevant European standards based on the horizontal standards developed by JTC 10.”\n \nDeveloping an international version\nIn 2020, IEC approved a new work proposal for the development of a new standard based on CEN-CLC EN 45556 which provides a general method for assessing the proportion of reused components. This proposed standard, IEC 63333 ED1, applies to electrical and electronic products and can be used by other product types. According to the current timeline, the standard is expected to be published in late 2022."

        "abstract": "The older we get, the more we consume energy, especially electricity.",
        "content": "According to several studies, and contrary to most perceptions, the elderly consume more energy than the young, especially in developed nations. The 70+ age demographic generally has a more affluent lifestyle than the 20+ age group, equating with a bigger use of consumer electronic devices of all kinds. Smart homes can be defined as homes with technologically advanced systems to enable domestic task automation, easier communication and higher security. They are particularly suitable for people with special needs, especially older people. Alarm-triggering devices and many other active assisted living (AAL) tools, such as voice-activated systems, consume electric power, but are viewed as essential to help people stay at home as long as possible.\nSustainable solutions\nThere are ways of reducing the increasing energy consumption of our ageing world. One of them is improving our energy efficiency. IEC has put energy efficiency at the core of its standards development work. It has established a special advisory group to address EE-related issues, ACEE (the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency). It coordinates activities related to energy efficiency inside the IEC and encourages a systems perspective for the development of standards for energy efficiency. It publishes two guides to help IEC technical committees grapple with EE.\nOne of the four IEC Conformity Assessment systems, IECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components), has established the IECEE Electrical Energy Efficiency (E3) programme, a globally standardized approach to testing and verifying energy efficiency for electrical and electronic equipment, based on IEC International Standards.\nAnother way is to generate an increasing part of our electricity requirement by renewable energy systems.\nIEC develops standards which help all renewable energy systems to be built and used efficiently and safely. At least five IEC TCs deal with these aspects, including IEC TC 82 which prepares standards for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems or IEC TC 88 which releases publications covering wind energy systems. TC  82, for instance, publishes the IEC 60904 series on PV devices and all their different parts.\nOne of the four IEC CA Systems, IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Renewable Energy Applications) is specifically designed to address certification issues relating to renewable energy systems. The scheme applies to solar, wind and marine energy facilities.\nRead more: https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2020-06/energy-for-our-ageing-world"

Within the framework of the IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme, the IEC National Committee of Australia has agreed to mentor the National Electrotechnical Committee of Cambodia.\nAs part of this mentorship, Australia will help Cambodia develop its national electrotechnical committee in order to improve its participation in IEC standardization and conformity assessment activities. According to Pen Tonat, Secretary of the NEC of Cambodia, “The IEC Mentoring Programme will help Cambodia to gain competency and practical experience in IEC standards development and conformity assessment activities. I hope my country will continue to become stronger in relevant competencies.”\nA long-standing relationship\nThe IEC Affiliate Mentoring Programme builds upon an existing strong relationship between Standards Australia and the Institute of Standards of Cambodia (ISC). Both organizations participated in the ASEAN-Australia Digital Trade Standards Cooperation Initiative which was led by Standards Australia. In 2019, Standards Australia and ISC worked together to co-host a workshop as part of this Initiative.\nIn addition, the two organizations meet on a regular basis to discuss topics of shared interest including digital trade, capacity building, block chain, and e-commerce. Given the current interruption of international travel, Standards Australia and ISC have remained in close – virtual – contact and shared best practices regarding the pandemic and have been able to advance topics of mutual interest such as the ISC contribution in setting up the new ASEAN Working Group on digital trade standards for the region.\nAs noted by Clare Hobern, International Engagement Manager at Standards Australia, “We are delighted to have entered into an IEC Mentoring Arrangement with the ISC. At Standards Australia, we advocate for the multilateral standardisation system and have strong relations with national, regional and international standards organisations. Through our work, we can assist other national standardization bodies in the region to build strong and reliable national systems that contribute to developing and adopting internationally aligned standards. This helps our region to trade with greater confidence, while strengthening our regional economy and security.\nWe are looking forward to contributing to the ISC’s bigger picture and watching the relationship between Australia and Cambodia continue to grow from strength to strength”.\nMore information is available on the Standards Australia website."

Before starting work on technical aspects, experts first have to agree on the terminology used in the standards, so that everyone understands the concepts referred to.\nAccording to Luca Mari, Chair of IEC TC 1, \"terminology conveys the implicit message that it only deals with terms. But it is way more than that: it is about definitions as well as terms and to agree on definitions, we need to agree on concepts and meaning in order to understand each other.”\nWith digital transformation affecting all our lives at a pace never even envisaged a few years ago, terminology definitions are required for new information technology standards, in forward-looking areas. Despite the Covid pandemic, TC 1 has risen to the challenge in 2020 and published a crucial tool for the digital age, a new standard on a much debated term and concept.\nIEC 60050-741 defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as an infrastructure of interconnected entities, people, systems and information resources together with services which processes and reacts to information from the physical world and virtual world. This definition is to be used by all IEC TCs. \nThe TC has also published the third edition of IEC 60050-426 on explosive atmospheres as well as the second edition of IEC 60050-447 on measuring relays and protective equipment."

        "content": "If you haven’t got your health, you haven’t got anything. We are reminded of this regularly, as we live through the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMany of us will use medical devices, equipment and systems, at some point during our lives as part of the healthcare services we receive, whether at a hospital, GP surgery or at home.\nThey monitor our health and well-being and gather personal data which can be used to diagnose and treat us.\nIt’s a booming industry. The global medical devices market is expected to grow to USD 612,7 billion by 2025, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights. Some reasons for this are a rising prevalence of chronic diseases and growth in surgical procedures across the world.\nWe assume that these devices and systems are safe and reliable and that the healthcare professionals know how to operate them safely.\nSo how do we ensure that these devices are really safe?\nTesting and certifying medical devices to international standards\nIECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components provides testing and certification for the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of 22 categories of products.\nIn the case of the category for electrical equipment for medical use, IECEE testing laboratories expert task forces (MEAS, MED) cover two areas:\n\nsafety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use (MEAS) related to the IEC 61010 series of standards\nelectrical equipment for medical use (MED), related to IEC 60601 series of standards for the general requirements for basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems, and IEC 80601 series of standards, which define the requirements for specific products or specific measurements built into products\n\nThere are many aspects to consider when evaluating such products, such as testing the device itself, considering how it is used by operators and patients, ensuring that the testing labs around the world carry out harmonized tests, have the necessary equipment, training and up to date information they need in order to do the tests correctly.\nRead the e-tech interview with Pamela Gwynn and Ted Gartner, Joint Convenors of the Committee of the IECEE expert task force which carries out this work and find out more."

        "content": "Connection to the outside world has become more important in 2020 than ever before. Millions of people are teleworking, while students of all ages have got used to distance learning, because of COVID-19. \nOther services such as healthcare and fitness and leisure are available through online services in the home. \nSmart devices and services used across many sectors would not exist without electronic components. They are at the core of all connectivity. Sensors especially.\nThese can be active or passive. Active sensors require an external source of power to operate while passive sensors simply detect and respond to some type of input from the physical environment. They come in many shapes and forms: vision, flow, fibre optic, gas, motion, image, colour, light, pressure, infrared, photoelectric and so on.\nSensors and sensor systems are a key underpinning technology for a wide range of applications. They can be used to improve quality control and productivity in manufacturing processes by monitoring variables such as temperature, pressure, flow and composition. \nThey help ensure the environment is clean and healthy by monitoring the levels of toxic chemicals and gases emitted in the air, both locally and – via satellites – globally. They monitor area and regional compliance with environmental standards. \nThey enhance health, safety and security in the home and workplace through their use in air-conditioning systems, fire and smoke detection and surveillance equipment. They play a major role in medical devices, transportation, entertainment equipment and everyday consumer products.\nThe importance of IEC Standards\nIEC, through its technical committees, develops a huge number of international standards, which ensure that these new technologies are safe and reliable as well as interoperable. \nFor instance, IEC Technical Committee 47 prepares international standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of sensors and the IEC Systems Committee for active assisted living (IEC SyC AAL), develops standards which enable usability and accessibility of AAL systems and services, cross-vendor interoperability of AAL systems, services, products and components and address systems level aspects such as safety, security and privacy. \nThese allow all people to use services and products safely in their homes. (See: Active assisted living for everyone and IEC Systems committee for active assisted living expands scope)\nReliance on IECQ testing and certification\nElectronic components must be accurate, reliable and high quality. Defective components can have serious consequences for humans and their environment. \nThey also have to meet the requirements of national or regional regulations concerning hazardous substances.\nManufacturers and suppliers of all types of electronic components throughout the world have a powerful tool at their disposal, enabling their products to meet the strictest requirements: IECQ testing and certification. IECQ is the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components. \nAs the worldwide approval and certification system covering the supply of electronic components, assemblies and associated materials and processes, IECQ tests and certifies components using quality assessment specifications based on IEC International Standards. \nIn addition, there is a multitude of related materials and processes that are covered by the IECQ schemes. IECQ certificates are used worldwide as a tool to monitor and control the manufacturing supply chain, thus helping to reduce costs and time to market, and eliminating the need for multiple re-assessments of suppliers. \nFind out more about the different IECQ Certification Schemes"

They help deliver healthcare, manage investments, track online fraud, streamline manufacturing processes and much more.\nAI offers many benefits, but it also raises concerns, for instance ethical and societal for people who use or come into contact with such technologies.\nWael William Diab who chairs the IEC and ISO standardization activities for artificial intelligence, presented the group’s work in a virtual event during the IEC General Meeting and answered questions from the audience.\n“The IEC GM webinar series was a great opportunity to have an interactive session on the AI work we are doing where we could both present some of the recent work as well as interact with the community at large,” said Diab.\nAI standards and work in the pipeline\nDiab highlighted the committee’s achievements noting the publication of Big Data Reference Architecture – ISO/IEC 20546, 20547-1, -2, -3, and -5, the first AI trustworthiness standard – ISO/IEC 24028 and ISO/IEC 24030 AI use cases, with over 130, which is nearing completion.\n“Artificial intelligence is one of the key enabling technologies for the digital transformation of industry that will revolutionize how we love work and play. The wholistic ecosystem approach to IT standardization aspect of AI that SC 42 is taking in collaboration with the application domain work the IEC technical committees are doing provides for a unique oppression to accelerate the adoption while simultaneously addressing key issues such as ethics and trustworthiness from the start,” said Diab.\nHe noted some of the new projects, including:\n\nAI MSS (Management Systems Standard) (ISO/IEC 42001)\nData quality for analytics and machine learning series (ISO/IEC 5259)\nAI system lifecycle (ISO/IEC 5338)\nSQuaRE (Systems and Quality Requirements and Evaluation) enhancements for AI systems (ISO/IEC 5059)\nAlgorithmic assessment of classification performance (ISO/IEC 4213)\nAI System lifecycle (ISO/IEC 5338)\nFunctional safety and AI systems (ISO/IEC 5469)\nGuidelines for AI applications (ISO/IEC 5339)\nKnowledge engineering (ISO/IEC 5392)\n\nAudience feedback\nParticipants came from diverse sectors, including energy, government, healthcare, industrial automation, semiconductors, software service provision and standards and certification. Over 140 registered however, the event had over 500 views on YouTube and Facebook.\nRalph Sporer, IEC VP and Chair of the Standardization Management Board, commented: “Very interesting as always to hear from Wael Diab on the all the topics around AI that are covered by SC 42. It is encouraging to see how standards can help build trust and therefore provide the base for a widespread uptake of the technology on an international scale.”\n“I work at the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS), in the Department of Legal Metrology. Attending the AI webinar was a good opportunity to broaden my research and find out what's going on in standardization. To my surprise, there are already a lot of activities. Standards for trustworthiness and generic use cases seem to be under review or even published. Congrats on these timely activities,” said Volker Zeuner, Scientist at METAS.\nChief Engineer and Consultant on Safety for infoteam Software, Frank Poignee said of the event: “The AI session was very informative. I personally would be happy to have this event more often to stay updated on all the AI threads running in the IEC.”\nQuestions from the session\nDiab explained how the committee works, decides new projects and use cases and the types of deliverables it produces. Questions addressed AI trends, challenges to widespread adoption as well as going into some of the work areas, such as trustworthiness, safety and reliability of AI systems.

We felt the time was right because the digital transformation of business and society has increased the expectations of users. \nIf anything, the global pandemic has accelerated the pace of change as remote working has become more prevalent and video conferences have replaced traditional in-person meetings for many. Our old website was designed for use with desktop computers, but the reality is that our visitors are using a range of different types of devices, including laptops, smartphones and tablets, to browse and interact with our content and services.\nIt is important to provide users with a consistent, satisfying and fast-loading experience and the size of their screen should not count against them. Roughly a third of our visitors use smartphones or tablets to browse the IEC website. \nThe old iec.ch was not friendly for users who did not have access to a PC. Pages loaded more slowly on mobile devices and the site was even more difficult to navigate.\nThe new responsive design addresses these challenges. It is fully functional and simple to navigate on all devices, no matter the size of the screen. \nWe have placed the user experience at the centre of what we are trying to achieve. We have made the navigation menu clearer and easier to use: it is less cluttered and presents information in a more intuitive way.\nIt will be much simpler to access relevant information about standards and conformity assessment. Users will understand exactly where they are in the site and how they arrived there.\nOur designers have given the new iec.ch a more contemporary look and feel, which the blog shares, but the new look is more than cosmetic. We have reduced the amount of text on pages, where possible, to focus more on key information and to provide a signposting service to other sites, briefing papers and reports where users can explore issues in depth.\nAt the same time, we are increasing the amount of multimedia content on the website to create a more dynamic experience. In future, we will use more video, graphics and audio for storytelling.\nOf critical importance, the new website is more secure. The backend is more resilient and reliable than its predecessor.\nLooking ahead, we still have work to do. The next phase will be about improving the accessibility of the website to bring it more fully in line with W3C recommendations."

        "content": "New global challenges are emerging. Worldwide population is now at 7.8 billion and is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. Economic well-being is fuelling consumption but also over-consumption and materialism. Waste is proliferating and natural resources are being depleted. Already, 75% of the Earth’s surface is showing signs of degradation.\nIn a recent IEC managed networking session hosted by the Chair of the IEC Advisory Group on Environmental Aspects (ACEA), Solange Blaszkowski, presented the circular economy as a solution to these challenges and how standards can help.\nTransitioning to a Green Economy\nThe concept of a circular economy is a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived throughout the lifecycle of a product. Blaszkowski provides the following definition of a circular economy: a systemic approach to the design of products, enabling sustainable economic growth by managing resources effectively as a result of making the flow of materials more circular and reducing and ultimately eliminating waste.\nCircular mechanisms are introduced, allowing for products and materials to be reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured and, ultimately, recycled. As Blaszkowski notes, “The circular economy is a powerful instrument to achieve sustainable economic growth while retaining the value of resources in the economy.”\nFocusing on material efficiency\nThe efficient use of material is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the conservation of materials by making products more durable, resource-efficient and facilitates the reuse or recycling of parts at the end of life.\nAccording to Blaszkowsi, “Material efficiency expresses how efficiently materials can be used to deliver a function and the extent to which they are kept in use and not discarded. The ultimate objective is to keep material in use forever”.\nFor many years, regulation has focused on ensuring the energy efficiency of products. Now, however, with the increased demand for materials combined with the imminent scarcity of resources, the focus is shifting to material usage and preservation.\nCircular economy impact on standardization\nNew trend will emerge with implications for standardization. For example, what will be the implication for safety, reliability and performance as products last longer? How will data removal and security be guaranteed as the ownership of a product changes?\nAs products are repaired, what will be the minimum requirements for parts reliability, including repaired parts? And, as products contain recycled parts, how will the safety and performance of these recycled parts be assured?\nMeasuring circularity\nIn order to better understand the impact of the circular economy, data will be needed can assess, for example, reused components within a product or the amount of recycled materials. However, accessing such data for electrical and electronic products is challenging given the complexity of the supply chain.\nAs noted by session panellist Walter Jager from IEC TC 111, “To be effective given the large number of suppliers and the different materials in those components, we need to have standards that enable a common language”.\nFinding new business models\nThe move towards a circular economy will require the introduction of new business models. According to the session panellist Jens Giegerich from ACEA, business models based on renting or leasing products are emerging. “More appliances are available for renting, such as pay-per-use or pay-per-month. We can expect that leasing models will grow in the future”.\nHowever, not all products will be suitable for such a model. As Giegerich notes, “small appliances like kettles offer little or no incentive to rent given their low price. However, this model is suitable for products like washing machines as is already the case in some European countries”.\nE-waste challenge\nThe growing amount e-waste remains a challenge. Standardization work is underway for the sustainable management of e-waste which is directly linked to the initial product design and durability. Tools are needed that can assess the durability, repairability, upgradeability, and, eventually, the recovery and reuse of components.\nAccording to Claudia Kuss-Tenzer, an environmental professional on the panel, “Resource circularity is not necessarily sustainable. We must think holistically about the absolute impact and not exclusively on resource management and resource effectiveness. We must look at the macro-level to achieve sustainability of circular economy”\nAbout the networking sessions\nAs part of its virtual 2020 General Meeting, the IEC organized a series of moderated networking sessions on topics such as the circular economy, artificial intelligence, cyber security and 5G.

        "abstract": "The rollout of 5G networks around the world does not pose risks to human health. That was the message from an online briefing session during the 2020 IEC General Meeting.",
        "content": "A reminder of the electromagnetic spectrum was the starting point for a look at the safety of 5G and the earlier generations of mobile telecommunications networks. The spectrum ranges from electric power to gamma radiation, with radio waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet and X-rays in between.\nThe point made was that the radio frequency band — used for 3G, 4G and 5G — is in the non-ionizing part of the spectrum, which does not pose the health risks associated with ionizing radiation where we find the ultraviolet band, medical X-rays and radioactive sources. Nevertheless, very strict safety standards are in place for non-ionizing radiation, which beyond certain thresholds can heat body tissue and even cause burns.\nThe safety recommendations derive from the work of the International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection. ICNIRP produces regularly updated guidelines for protection against harmful effects of radiofrequency fields based on over 50 years of scientific research.\nBoth the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) reference the ICNIRP guidelines in their advice to governments and stakeholders on radiofrequency safety.\nThe ICNIRP has concluded that there is no evidence that 5G radiation poses a threat to human health. There is also good news for the environment.\n5G power levels at base stations and on devices are very low. In fact, 5G is more efficient than 3G and 4G, which means that the actual power used to establish and guarantee a connection is very low.\nAt the same time, exposure levels are coming down thanks to the beam steering technology used by 5G, which avoids spillage. Beam steering is more efficient as it can connect more users through the smaller radio signals.\nModerating the session was Mike Wood, who leads IEC development work on electromagnetic field safety standards for 5G and all of the other wireless networks. Wood  has been heavily involved in the rollout of 5G in his native Australia, where he works for the mobile operator, Telstra.\nCompleting the distinguished panel were: Sami Gabriel of Vodafone Group, who develops IEC electromagnetism safety standards for base stations, handsets and IoT devices; Thomas Barmueller, the Mobile and Wireless Forum (MWF) director for Europe, Middle East and Africa; Matt Schultz, president of the Australian Smart Communities Association and co-chair of digital infrastructure in the G20 Global Smart Cities Alliance; and Ian Oppermann,  IEC Council Board member and Chief Data Scientist for the New South Wales government, in Australia.\nOther topics covered in the GM 2020 moderated networking sessions include cyber security, the transition to a circular economy, conformity assessment, artificial intelligence and IEC Young Professionals Programme.\nMore\nWatch the full video here"

A total of 84 countries participate in the programme.\nHe notes that four countries (Cabo Verde, Congo, Mali and Uzbekistan) are the most recent countries to have declared the national adoption of IEC Standards. As a result, 76% of affiliate countries have now done so.\nSetting up an NEC\nThe establishment of a national electrotechnical committee (NEC) is an important step in helping countries join the standardization community. With stakeholders from the private and public sector involved in electrotechnology, the NEC serves as an official representative to the IEC. It makes informed choices about the national standards and ensure that these standards are applied within the country.\nNECs provide an important contribution to economic development by aligning their work priorities to national development plans. As Francois Ahoti, the IEC Regional Director for Africa, notes “IEC activities turn economies on for development”.\nAmong affiliate countries, 59 have set up NECs of which three have done so in the past year Eswatini, Myanmar and Uzbekistan). 70% of affiliate countries have now set up an NEC.\nConformity assessment\nThe Affiliate Conformity Assessment Status (ACAS) seeks to train affiliate countries to use IEC Standards alongside the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. As part of the programme, affiliate countries have access to learning modules, including webinars, and can participate in the IEC CA Systems.\nAffiliates are asked to sign the ACAS Pledge which includes a commitment to sign the ACAS Declaration within five years. With the ACAS Declaration, affiliates can access additional ACAS learning modules and agree to accept IEC conformity assessment certificates related to the IEC Standards adopted at the national level.\nRojas notes that, to date, 35 affiliate countries have signed the ACAS Pledge of which two have done so in the last year (Niger and Tanzania). In addition, 26 affiliate countries have signed the ACAS Declaration of which Burkina Faso and Senegal are the two most recent signatories.\nTrond Sollie has been appointed IEC Ambassador for Affiliate country training needs as relates to IEC CA Systems for a two-year period (2020-2021).\nNew IEC Affiliate Leader\nThe IEC Affiliate Country Programme welcomes Battsengel Gurragchaa as the IEC Affiliate Leader as of January 2021.

In my work, I think differently because I am aware of standards. Now I am involved in standardization work which offers my company another opportunity to be involved with the National Committee”.\nTong concurred noting that the programme has allowed him to become more involved in his area of interest, smart cities, at both the national and international levels. “It is a stepping- stone to get involved.”\nFor Hobern, the YP Programme “fosters an international community in standardization. It is an opportunity to meet people working in the same area from around the world and learn from each other.\nCompanies who invest in employee participation in the YP Programme also reap benefits. According to Wood, “Companies that invest in YPs get 10 times the value in terms of the networking, the contacts and the exposure to new ideas. And we get to see the upcoming stars of the future”.\nYP contribution to IEC work\nWith the development of 5G two years earlier than anticipated, IEC TC 106 needed to fast-track the testing methods needed to assess human exposure to 5G. With the help of a young engineer to lead the project, IEC TC 106 published a technical report in record time. “We benefited from dynamic leadership, harnessing available knowledge and a can-do attitude. YPs will ask questions that no one will have thought of. Volunteering is a great way to get involved.”\nHe adds, “Words that come to mind: wanting to learn and make a difference, energy and enthusiasm. We want you to be the leaders in 10 years. I see a lot of YPs working in 5G and expect to see them leading 6G”.\nHow to become a YP\nEach year, IEC National Committees are invited to select two candidates to participate in the YP programme, including to attend the annual YP workshop held alongside the IEC General Meeting.\nSelection for the YP programme is determined by IEC National Committees which varies by country. Hobern notes that “In Australia, we have a call for applications to widen field and select two candidates in a competitive process. We seek candidates who are have a commitment to be involved in the long term. “ The National Committee from Australia runs a similar programme on the national level known as Nextgen.\nModerated networking sessions\nAs part of its virtual 2020 General Meeting, the IEC organized a series of moderated networking sessions on topics such as the circular economy, artificial intelligence, cyber security and 5G. These sessions can be viewed live on  The recordings of these sessions is available on Facebook and YouTube."

All these panellits shared their experiences in building awareness and training about IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment, sometimes contributing through the IEC Young Professional Programme or directly in Academia.\nTiedemann insisted on the service aspect of the IEC Academy and Capacity Building department inside Central Office and the teamwork with regional centres. “Contributing to raising quality, transparency and agility is important to us,” he said in his introductory remarks.\nHe also presented an overview of what was achieved in 2020 so far, including 22 public webinars which drew 4200 attendees and 6000 viewers of recorded webinars. In addition, 18 training webinars for NCs and regional centres were set up.\nSurvey of NCs\nHe equally introduced some of the results of a survey conducted by his team to assess the capacity building and training capability in NCs. “The idea was to find out how NCs coped, notably in the current situation due to the pandemic,” Tiedemann explained. 68% of all NCs replied, mostly NC Secretaries, and the results highlighted that a very large majority of NCs viewed training as an essential part of their strategy. Most NCs said that after the Covid-19 pandemic, they would favour a hybrid online and face-to face training approach, rather than simply return to face-to-face training sessions. Among the most essential skills that required training, the NCs put knowledge about the IEC directives in first position, followed by standard drafting/editing and consensus building. 77% of those surveyed did not have access to an online training platform.\nLaunch of new online training platform\nOnline Learning and Development Coordinator Ian Gardner presented the IEC Academy new online training platform tool based on the Moodle open source online training platform. The design of the platform was built inside the IEC and there is no licensing fee required to use it. Two courses are currently available, IEC Convenor and Project Leader, as well as New Standardization Expert. For more information on the platform: https://academy.iec.ch. All webinars can be found at https://www.iec.ch/academy\nFeedback from NCs and other users is welcome and can be sent to academy@iec.ch\nTiedemann also participated in the Affiliate Country Forum to give specific information on capacity building and training for Affiliate Countries earlier this week."

        "content": "On 12 November, the IEC organized a networking session dedicated to conformity assessment (CA) in general and IECEx in particular. Participants from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America joined the session hosted by IECEx and IECQ Executive Secretary Chris Agius.\nIEC CA – which, together with standardization, is one of the pillars of the IEC – represents the only globally standardized approach to testing and certification, dedicated to the electrotechnical sectors. Risk and quality management by companies and governments would not be possible without reliable conformity assessment such as testing and certification.\nAbout CA\nPrior to answering questions and starting a discussion, Chris Agius spent a few minutes explaining conformity assessment (CA), a very broad term that encompasses many aspects related to assessing conformance, such as testing, certification, attestation, accreditation and approval. He drew attention to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of international standards that cover all aspects of conformity assessment and certification activities, encouraging anyone interested in learning about or getting involved in CA to start with terminology, in ISO/IEC 17000. Terminology is key to understand CA which is by no means limited to the certification community.\nIEC CA Systems v. national accreditation\nAsked how national accreditation fits in the IEC CA Systems, Chris explained that accreditation can be defined as the formal recognition of a body to be able to carry out certain tasks related to CA. There is a certain degree of consistency in the tasks performed by accreditation bodies throughout the world because they use the ISO/IEC 17000 series. However, variations in their approach is inevitable, meaning they may achieve the same results through different methods.\nThe IEC approach goes a step further, making it essential to have a standardized way of doing testing and certification: a single set of rules, operational procedures, reporting format, certification format that have to be accepted by all participating bodies. To ensure consistency, the IEC also embraces the concept of peer assessment. It is essential that all bodies accept one another through mutual recognition which is achieved by this peer assessment process. The IEC CA Systems comprises laboratories, inspection and certification bodies (CBs) whose work is based on the same peer assessment process. One of the requirements for acceptance in the IEC CA Systems is compliance with the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards.\nIn IECEx, test labs and CBs have to be evaluated on an annual basis. However, if a body already holds accreditation, that may reduce the need to carry out a full and complete evaluation of the organization.\nDevelopments in IECEx\nAsked about new developments in IECEx, in addition to the certification of Ex electrical equipment, service facilities and personnel working in Ex environment, Chris mentioned the recent addition of non-electrical or mechanical equipment complying with the ISO/IEC 80079 series of standards. Certification of assemblies in compliance with IEC 60079-46 has also been added. IECEx has introduced a programme for organizations that provide training for workers in the Ex field.\nAjay Maira, from Australia, one of the participants in the session, a seasoned expert in Ex certification and an IECEx lead assessor, offered his view on how IECEx, since its inception in 1996, has changed the Ex landscape, going from a multitude of national certificates to one certificate accepted everywhere, regardless of national certification, thus facilitating international trade. Moreover, all products bearing the IECEx certificate are now in most cases automatically accepted as a backbone for national certification if required.\nIECEx as a model for IECRE\nAsked how IECEx could assist IECRE, the newest IEC CA System for renewable energies, Chris explained that IECEx went from mutual recognition to operating a full certificate and conformity scheme operating as a business. “Rather than promoting individual bodies, all bodies and the community came together to develop, build and promote the IECEx brand. My recommendation is for IECRE to work together, treat IECRE as a brand and promote it as a business.”\nIn addition, having all master certificates available on secure websites provides an additional value to the community because it also served as a buyers’ guide for products and services. This is of particular importance for IECEx and IECRE.\nAbout certificates\nWolfram Zeitz, IECEE and IECRE Executive Secretary, added that certificates are different for each system, due to the nature of the products that are certified. Within a system, all certificates are aligned on the same model and provide the same information. Certificates need to be easily identified as being part of the system, provide enough information so that the product is easily identified.\nRaising the issue of questions or complaints regarding a certificate, Chris explained that they should be addressed to the certification body in the first place, but if the CB remains silent, the IECEx Secretariat will intervene and contact the CB.\nRemote auditing\nFactory audit is a mandatory component and part of the certification process. Without it, certificates cannot be issued; and to keep the certificate current, ongoing factory audits must be conducted. How to perform factory audits online and evaluate the risks that this may entail is a question hugely relevant today as the world is facing a global health crisis.\nSince the beginning of the year, travel restrictions have prevented auditors to visit factories. IECEx rapidly issued an interim measure, a business continuity document to address the concerns raised by the Covid-19 pandemic. The document included provisions for the use of remote auditing. As Chris said, “there are risks in conducting remote auditing, but the greater risk is to do nothing. Without ongoing factory audits, certificates would be suspended. The consequence is then that manufacturers cannot release products carrying the IECEx certificate reference number, leading to major financial repercussions. Careful planning is key to a successful remote audit.” Ajay Maira also shared his experience of performing remote audits. Both he and Chris agree that IECEx remote audits may be part of the factory auditing process in the future.\nChris concluded the session by thanking all participants in the session, as well as those following it on Facebook.\nAbout the networking sessions\nAs part of its virtual 2020 General Meeting currently underway, the IEC is organizing moderated networking sessions on topics such as the circular economy, artificial intelligence, cyber security and 5G. These sessions can be viewed live on Facebook. The recordings are made available on Facebook and YouTube."

It will, among other things, take on board experience from other organizations, notably the ISO Virtual Standards Development process as well as the CENELEC Flexible Standards process to help with the review. It will also identify recommendations for change as well as bottlenecks, pain points and external constraints as well as develop a methodology to achieve change. The input of all the IEC committees will be gathered to move forward in these areas.\nAnother ad-hoc group was set up which will be headed jointly by Kareen Riley-Tacos, SMB member for Australia and Beer Opatsuwan, alternate member for Australia. ahG 90 will, among other things, define the process to measure the success and performance of the SMB and all committee work. This will include corresponding metrics which, according to Kareen Riley-Tacos, will be “looking at benefits and realizations rather than hard key performance targets (KPIs).” The group will also develop a procedure to prioritize and facilitate SMB work, involving annual action plans, for instance. ahG 90 is to provide its final report in July 2021."

        "content": "Recognizing the importance of standardization in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the IEC organized a networking session to discuss the implementation of the SDGs on 11 November.\nHosted by Vimal Mahendru, IEC Ambassador, it included an eclectic group of ten participants representing Africa, Europe, North America and Australasia, as well as the United Nations.\nThe SDGs are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, addressing global challenges such as poverty, inequality and climate change. They recognize the interdependence between the goals and the importance of stakeholders in the private and public sector working together to achieve them.\nAccording to Mahendru, because the development of the past 100 years has been uneven, the SDGs offer an opportunity to bring the global community together and bridge the divide.\nWhy are the SDGs important?\nThe discussion began with the panellists providing their thoughts on the importance of the SDGs. Responses included finding ways to share resources, reduce inequality and bringing environmental security alongside prosperity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to reflect on the current situation and the impact of our actions.\nThe role of standards\nMahendru asked how standards can contribute to achieving the SDGs. While there is no direct link in the standards, he noted that all SDGs are impacted in some way by standards. They offer tools to help achieve the SDGs.\nAccording to Lorenza Jachia from the United Nations, “Standards are vital to the SDGs and we need them”. She mentioned the UN project that promoted the link between standards and the SDGs: https://standards4sdgs.unece.org/\nAs the safety expert Coen van Gulijk noted, “Standards are the codification of knowledge. Experts come together and discussions takes place. The IEC has an important role in ensuring that different perspectives are heard in the process”. The IEC recently published a white paper, Safety in the future, which highlights the importance of safety in achieving the SDGs.\nElectricity access\nElectricity access is an area that highlights the importance of the SDGs to several participants. For one panellist, the provision of electricity can be intermittent which affects refrigeration and food security. In addition, energy access is vital for other areas such as healthcare and education.\nThe IEC provides a number of standards that help achieve SDG 7 on energy access. It has worked together with Lighting Global to ensure that products that enable energy access meet minimum performance and safety requirements.\nResponsible use of resources\nOverconsumption and the use of natural resources as addressed in SDG 12 is another area where standards can help. Solange Blaszkowski, Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee for Environmental Affairs (ACEA) noted that the circular economy can provide a response to better use resources. However, standards will be needed that can address issues such as, for example, the safety of a reused component.\nConsumers will also need to change their mindset and whether they want products that last longer. While this may be the case for some products like washing machines it may not hold true for mobile phones.\nIEC has a portfolio of publications that address the circular economy including:\n\nIEC 62430: Environmentally Conscious Design\nIEC TR 62635: End of Life information / recyclability rate calculation\nIEC TR 62824: Material Efficiency considerations in ECD\nIEC 62309: Dependability of products containing reused parts\nIEC 62402: Obsolescence management\nIEC 63077: Refurbishment for medical imaging equipment\n\nMahendru closed the session by thanking the participants: Solange Blaszkowski, Gabriela Ehrlich, Lorenza Jachia, Chris Moller, Carlos Perez, James Sankar, Coen van Gulijk, and Anne Wacera Wambugu. Together they toasted the global community of standardization and the SDGs.\nAbout the networking sessions\nAs part of its virtual 2020 General Meeting currently underway, the IEC is organizing moderated networking sessions on topics such as the circular economy, artificial intelligence, cyber security and 5G. These sessions can be viewed live on Facebook. The recordings are made available on Facebook and YouTube."

The Lord Kelvin Award is the highest honour in the global electrotechnology industry.\nMr Kajiya, who becomes the 36th laureate and the fifth from Japan, received the gold medal in a ceremony held in Japan. The IEC President, Dr Yinbiao Shu, and the IEC General Secretary, Mr Philippe Metzger, sent video messages.\n“It is my pleasure and honour to bestow the 2020 Lord Kelvin Award on Mr Toshiyuki Kajiya, in recognition of his valued leadership and tireless support of the IEC,” said Dr Shu.\n“I would like to thank Mr Toshiyuki Kajiya — a tireless advocate for IEC during all these years — for his dedication and professional expertise which has advanced the market-relevance and global reach of IEC work in many ways,” said Mr Metzger.\nMr Kajiya is the Director and Board Member of Japan’s Institute of Global Safety Promotion. He is the 2019 recipient of the Japanese Prime Minister Award for Industrial Standardization.\nSince 2005, Mr Kajiya has been involved in IEC Conformity Assessment work as the Head Delegate to the Certification Management Committee of the System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE). He is also Chair of the IECEE Japanese National Committee and in 2009 joined the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB).\nAs an eminent member of both CAB and IECEE, Mr Kajiya has led activities that have achieved formal recognition of the Certification Body (CB) Test Certificate as proof of compliance by national regulators in the Gulf and Eurasian economic regions. He has conducted capacity building activities and increased effective use of IECEE in the ASEAN region through his leadership in planning and role as lecturer and trainer in the IEC Affiliate Conformity Assessment Status (ACAS) programme. \nAbout the Lord Kelvin Award\nThe prestigious IEC Lord Kelvin Award takes its name from the first IEC President, who was a distinguished scientist and prolific inventor. Lord Kelvin contributed significantly to the advancement of modern physics and the practical applications of electrotechnology.\nLord Kelvin, together with Charles Le Maistre, the first IEC General Secretary, can be considered the true fathers of standardization. They put in place the processes and methodologies that enable companies to spread new technologies broadly and countries to build more sustainable infrastructure.\nToday, the Lord Kelvin Award honours their vision and drive to understand and improve the practical applications of the millions of electrical and electronic devices and systems that are part of our daily lives.\nAbout IEC\nThe IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that brings together 173 countries and coordinates the work of 20 000 experts globally. IEC International Standards and conformity assessment work underpins international trade in electrical and electronic goods. It facilitates electricity access, and verifies the safety, performance and interoperability of electric and electronic devices and systems, including for example consumer devices such as mobile phones or refrigerators, office and medical equipment, information technology, electricity generation, and much more.\nConformity assessment refers to any activity that determines whether a product, system, service and sometimes people fulfil the requirements and characteristics described in a standard or specification. Such requirements can include performance, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, durability, or environmental impacts such as pollution or noise. Verification is generally done through testing and/or inspection."

        "content": "The IEC General Meeting (GM), which is currently taking place virtually for the first time in history, is an opportunity for IEC members to reflect on recent developments, and especially assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the questions raised during the GM concerns the work of the various IEC Systems Committees, Technical Committees and Subcommittees and how they have all been affected by the pandemic.\nBusiness as usual\nDuring the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) Meeting (pictured), one of the key events of the GM, IEC Standardization Director Pierre Sebellin presented the latest figures on the work of the various Committees inside the IEC. The overall findings are that despite the pandemic, the production rate of standards and other publications did not decrease compared with previous years. “We even hit a peak in July with 104 publications, a much higher number than in 2019. June was good too: the IEC released 82 publications,” he described. It is forecasted that by the end of 2020, the IEC will have issued more than 650 publications, virtually on a par with the previous year.\nSupport from Central Office key\nFor work to continue as usual, despite the changing circumstances, the Standardization Department of IEC Central Office provided a huge amount of support to convert physical working group meetings into Zoom meetings and ensure that all the drafts were prepared and comments resolved. “We also had very regular contacts with the TC and SC Secretaries to ensure we received the various documents, including the various committee drafts up to the final drafts of international standards (FDIS) in due time for circulation,” Sebellin added. Central Office Technical Officers also put in a lot of work to track late projects. For instance, in October, 50 projects were put back on tracks thanks to their action.\nGeneral feedback\nTC members also provided some observations as to how they lived and worked through this unusual period. Most TCs switched to virtual meetings, and 43 plenary meetings were held online. The results were generally positive, with many people attending from all around the world. In some cases, though, virtual meetings took place over longer periods than physical meetings and because of the time differences, experts in different countries often had to meet at odd hours. Most members said that despite their adaptation to virtual ways of working, they nevertheless looked forward to having face to face meetings in the future.\nTo find out more about the IEC GM: https://gm2020.iec.ch/"

        "content": "The Internet of Things, big data, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence are transforming the connection between technology and people. New and complex safety requirements have emerged with the expansion of intelligent systems.\nAs more machines are integrated into factory and logistic automation, mobility and healthcare processes, the need to ensure safe procedures for people working with machines is increasing.\nIt may even be possible that machines gain a characteristic that is traditionally the reserve of humans: intelligence. While the probability of such a scenario is subject to debate, it is known that unforeseen consequences for humans inevitably emerge when new technology is introduced. Consequently, and now more than ever, it is critical to ensure that human safety is placed at the centre of the new human-machine relationship.\nA new IEC White Paper\nThe IEC has published a new white paper, Safety in the future, which examines the topic of safety in the new digital environment. It references current social trends and initiatives, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as various real-life examples that are pioneering innovative safety solutions for the future.\nThese solutions share the common understanding that the concept of safety will be delivered in an integrated system in which workers, machines and the environment collaborate. Based on this common understanding, the IEC White Paper introduces a collaborative framework called the tripartite system for safety to provide a systems approach to examining key elements of safety in the future. The collaboration will be made possible by information flows going back and forth between the different intelligent agents of the system: human workers, smart machines, and the IT-enabled environment in which they function.\nHowever, to achieve the goals of the tripartite system for safety will require significant efforts from the standardization community. For example, it will be necessary for standardization organizations to mitigate some of the most pressing challenges related to the decision-making between machines and humans as well as to expand their holistic approaches to safety by gathering insight from the fields of safety psychology, sociology and human behaviour.\nThe IEC White Paper concludes by formulating recommendations of both a general nature as well as specifically addressed to the IEC and its committees.\nDownloading the IEC White Paper\nThe development of the IEC White Paper Safety in the future has been made possible by the efforts of the IEC Market Strategy Board safety in the future project team.

        "content": "Cyber security expert Frances Cleveland has identified the key concepts for protecting cyber physical systems. She was leading an interactive briefing session on the differences between protecting IT and OT (operational technology) systems at the IEC General Meeting.\nThe Zoom meeting was streamed live on Facebook to make it available to a wider audience.  \nCleveland explained that IT security was mostly concerned with protecting the confidentiality of information and preventing access to sensitive data. However, technologies in the operational (OT) environment have different requirements and constraints.\n“The one thing that I want to point out here is that typically, not a hundred percent, typically IT focuses on preventing access to sensitive data,” she said. “In the OT environment, it’s mostly availability and integrity of the data because you’re trying to have safe and reliable operations rather than sensitive and private information protection”.\nFor example, our reliance on the efficient and continuous supply of power means that any loss of electricity would carry heavy implications for a wide range of vital services. The aim is therefore to ensure that these systems can continue to support the same levels of safety and reliability.\nCleveland identified five critical concepts: resilience; security by design; the fundamental importance of understanding the difference between information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT); risk assessment, risk mitigation, and continuous update of processes; and the role of international standards.\nResilience should be the overall strategy for ensuring business continuity. When focusing on resilience in general, organizations must consider safety, security, and reliability of the processes and the delivery of their services.\nResilience includes security measures that can mitigate impacts, not only before incidents (identify and prevent), but also during such incidents (detect and respond) and after incidents have been resolved (recover).\nSecurity by design is the most cost-effective approach to security. Security is vital for all critical infrastructures and should be designed into systems and operations from the beginning, rather than being applied after the systems have been implemented.\nIT and OT are similar but different. Technologies in operational environments have many differing security constraints and requirements from IT environments.\nRisk assessment, risk mitigation, and continuous update of processes are fundamental to improving security. Based on an organization’s business requirements, its security risk exposure must be determined (human safety, physical, functional, environmental, financial, societal, reputational) for all its business processes.\nCyber security standards and best practice guidelines for cyber physical (OT) environments should be used to support the risk management process and establish timely security programmes and policies.\n\n\n\n \nWatch the full video, including Q&A on Facebook and YouTube."

        "content": "The consequences of an attack on cyber physical systems (CPS) could be devastating for human lives and the environment. Examples of CPS include the smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring and industrial control systems.\nThe research firm Gartner predicts that within the next three years the financial impact of CPS attacks resulting in fatal casualties will exceed $50 billion. As well as reputation loss, this figure includes legal costs, compensation and regulatory fines.\nIt is also likely that regulators and governments will clamp down as the number of incidents grows due to insufficient investment in security. Gartner says that business leaders will be held personally liable if they fail to take adequate measures to secure CPS.\nIn some countries and regions, CEOs already face potentially severe penalties for failure to protect personal data. In the US, for example, corporate officers who fail to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) could pay hefty fines or spend up to five years in jail.\nUnfortunately, corporations do not always seem to understand the cyber security challenges of the operational technology used in CPS. A key issue is that security is too often understood only in terms of IT (information technology).\nThose responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as energy, manufacturing, healthcare or transport. \nThe growth of connected devices has accelerated the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT). From a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that unlike business systems, IACS are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nThat is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk. Where IT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad” — in the world of OT, availability is of foremost importance.\nPriorities for OT environments focus on health and safety and protecting the environment. In the event of an emergency in order to be able to protect personnel or to minimize the impacts of natural disasters, it is therefore vital that operators can receive accurate and timely information and can quickly take appropriate actions, such as shutting off power or shifting to backup equipment.  \nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges based on global best practices. For example, IEC 62443, is designed to keep OT systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.  \nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series."

It consists of 15 sessions taking place between 9 and 20 November.\nParticipants can register to attend management meetings, thematic workshops and two open sessions to discuss specific IEC work items. The 2020 IEC General Meeting also marks the first GM that Philippe Metzger will attend in his official capacity as IEC General Secretary & CEO.\nThe move to an exclusively virtual format has been made to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has accelerated the process towards digitalization and the adoption of online tools for businesses around the world, including at the IEC. The 2020 General Meeting provides an opportunity to showcase the seamless transition made to an all-digital environment without hampering IEC core activities or services.\nAccording to IEC President Dr Yinbiao Shu, “The IEC has shown strength and leadership throughout 2020. The COVID-19 global pandemic has brought to the forefront the importance of cooperation and at this IEC General Meeting we will have the opportunity to share our different experiences and approaches. It is only by working together that we can tackle the current emergency and any others that we may face.”\nThe General Secretary & CEO notes, “At the IEC, we are privileged to be able to leverage the unique know-how, insight and knowledge of thousands of experts representing almost every country and industry in the world. The General Meeting will mark an important occasion where we will be able to take stock of the past year and address some of the challenges that the IEC will need to consider in the years ahead.”\nTopics for the online sessions\nThe 84th IEC General Meeting will consist of a series of virtual management meetings of the Standardization Management Board, Conformity Assessment Board, Council Board and the Council. Given the time constraints inherent to virtual meetings, the Council session on 13 November 2020 will only address statutory items. To provide members with a forum to learn more about the ongoing governance review and new revenue generating opportunities, the IEC will host two open session on these topics.\nThree online sessions will allow developing and newly industrializing countries to learn more about the role of standardization in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the importance of conformity assessment and how to engage stakeholders in the standardization process. These three sessions will include case studies from participants in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nThe Academy and Capacity Building Day will showcase activities and best practices learned from the past year including stakeholder engagement and training approaches during COVID-19. It will also present its first courses available on the IEC Online Learning Platform. Information, including registration, is available on the IEC General Meeting 2020 website."

        "abstract": "The IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy.",
        "content": "The IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy. It consists of the following: using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for better performance, or improving the conversion of energy into electricity.\nMany energy efficient technologies and solutions are readily available. Investments and a commitment towards energy efficiency abound, yet a number of barriers inhibits the deployment of energy efficiency solutions.\nLack of awareness of saving potential, a focus on devices rather than systems which leads to a lower return on investment and a preference for lower cost rather than life-cycle gains are some of the barriers that impede harvesting the full potential of energy efficiency.\nStandardization can offer solutions to help overcome these barriers by, for example, providing definitions and measurements of performance, disseminating and promoting energy efficiency technologies and establishing minimum energy performance requirements.\nThe IEC has set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) to help IEC technical committees adopt energy efficient solutions in their standardization activity and support energy efficient technologies through their standards. IEC ACEE has developed two guides, Guide 118 and Guide 119, which can be used by IEC technical committees to harmonize energy efficiency standardization and adopt a systems approach.\nUnderstanding Guide 118\nGuide 118 seeks to harmonize the energy efficiency standardization and raise awareness that IEC publications can impact energy performance in both positive and negative ways. It also provides a definition to the different aspects of energy efficiency that technical committees can address when planning their work in this area so as to support the energy efficiency improvement process.\nGuide 118, together with Guide 119, promotes the use of a systems approach when addressing energy efficiency aspects in the context of standardization. In addition, IEC ACEE has published a practical case study on how the concepts found in Guide 118 can be applied to electrical motors.\nElectric motors\nIncreasing the efficiency of electric motors can be an affordable means to reduce energy consumption and, given their widespread use, also have a considerable impact.\nAccording to Franco Bua, member of ACEE, “Electric motor systems represent more than 50% of the global electricity used, of which the large majority of electric motors are used in machines, pumps, fans, compressors, conveyor belts, etc. It is a genuine opportunity to increase energy efficiency”.\nThe IEC ACEE case study on electric motors is based upon Guide 118 and the standards developed by IEC TC 2: Rotary machinery, that specifically address energy efficiency.\nDefining the boundaries\nWhen defining the boundaries defining the scope of energy efficiency considerations, IEC 60034-1 and IEC 60034-30-1 can be used. While IEC 60034-1 provides general rating and performance definitions for motors, IEC 60034-30-1 defines the energy efficiency classes for motors known as the IE code. Together, these two standards enable the comparison between different motor technologies regarding their energy efficiency potential.\nAs noted by Bua, “Boundaries are key to energy efficiency since they define what will be the focus. However, many boundaries are possible, and the case study considers three possibilities”.\nMeasurement and improvement\nTest methods are available in IEC 60034-2-1 to measure the energy efficiency of a motor. As a result, it is possible to set minimum energy performance requirements that can be compared and assessed as well as to compare industry products based on their energy efficiency.\nIEC TS 60034-31 provides guidelines with information on various technologies that can be used to support and improve energy efficiency.\nSupporting regulation\nBecause of their energy saving potential, electric motors have been a key focus for national energy efficiency policies. International standards have been an effective means to support national policies for minimum energy performance requirements for motors. As noted by Maarten van Werkhoven, member of ACEE, “A good set of standards will help regulators establish good energy efficiency regulations”.\nThe list of countries regulating the minimum energy performance requirements of motors is growing. According to Van Werkhoven, “Over time, we have witnessed not only an increase in the number of countries regulating motors but also an increase in ambition in their scope and efficiency requirements”."

        "content": "The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) has issued a very detailed report on how standards affect gender, particularly when it comes to safety issues. According to the report, When one size does not protect all: understanding why gender matters for standardization, standards often fail to protect women as well as men, leading to unintentional fatalities. \nSCC carried out a global analysis, using data from 106 countries, of the impact of gender on standardization. “Across countries and considering all age groups, we find evidence that the relationship between standardization and unintentional fatalities is indeed gender-specific. Men are benefitting more from the protective effects of standardization,” the report states.\nThe report cites several examples: personal protective equipment used in hospitals is largely based on male anthropometry, failing to protect women as well, a situation which had an impact on the health of female medical staff during the Covid pandemic. Another case in point is testing processes implemented by automotive manufacturers: typically, crash test dummies are not designed on women’s morphology. One of the results of this oversight is that women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured or die from a car accident than men.\nYet another example is voice-activated devices: many of them are more responsive to male voices than female ones which can also lead to accidents, in self-driving vehicles, for instance.\nNot enough women in technical committees\nThe reason for this male bias has partly to do with the lack of female representation inside standardization technical committees. “The failure of many standards to account for women may boil down to two inter-related factors: the lack of female representation in the development of standards and the lack of gender expertise in standards development,” the report argues.\nFigures were not always easy to come by, but the SCC tracked down the numbers of women in the Canadian IEC and ISO mirror committees, comparing them to the overall labour force. While women represent 50 % of the Canadian labour force, they only represent around 20% of the ISO mirror committee members and 10% of the IEC ones.\nChanges could be on the cards however: on May 14 2019, SCC joined international organizations, national standards bodies and international standards development bodies to join the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Declaration for Gender Responsive Standards and Standards Development. Signatories committed to, among other things, “aknowldege that representation of women in standards development is almost always below parity and that the outcomes for men and women are not explicitly addressed during the standards development process.” They also committed to take action to ensure that standards are gender responsive."

        "content": "Organizers of the Riyadh International Standards Summit held on 4 November 2020 have issued a call to action for the recognition, support and adoption of international standards. This is the first ever summit on standardization held within G20-related activities.\nOriginally intended to take place in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which currently holds the G20 Presidency, in light of the global pandemic, the Summit instead took place virtually, and welcomed participants from all over the world.\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU), under the auspices of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC), concluded the Riyadh International Standards Summit with the call to action for “each country to recognize, support, and adopt international standards to accelerate digital transformation in all sectors of the economy to help overcome global crises, such as COVID-19, and contribute towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)”.\nThe Call to Action emphasizes international standards’ important role in the implementation of the United Nations’ Global Agenda aimed at achieving all 17 SDGs by 2030. “Today’s global health crisis has highlighted the need to continue investing in our digital future, through investments to drive infrastructure development, connect the unconnected, and build confidence and trust in digital technologies: elements which are all crucial to the achievement of the SDGs.”\nReflecting on the issues addressed, ISO Secretary-General Sergio Mujica saw a strong common spirit shared by all participants. “This recognition raises the bar on supporting international standards and illustrates the critical role each country can play in overcoming our common challenges and boosting synergies for all. We look forward to the international community answering the call to recognize, support and adopt international standards as a key instrument for economic and social development.”\nThe Summit enabled an integrated, introspected and exhaustive look at international standards developed by IEC, ISO and ITU, and their role in global trade as well as in social and economic development. Key stakeholders and decision makers were able to exchange experiences and perspectives on the importance of international standards in addressing shared fears and aspirations for the future.\n“The call to action sends a real message in support of consensus-based international standards developed by IEC, ISO and ITU. It shows that, in these challenging moments of COVID-19, we are interdependent. Mutually beneficial global solutions can be found to our common global challenges,” said IEC General Secretary Philippe Metzger.\nDigital technologies used to strengthen and accelerate the collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to enhance the ability to prevent and mitigate future crises, have been a frequent topic of this year’s G20. The call to action reinforces the need for countries to leverage international standards to deliver solutions to such global challenges.\n“This pandemic calls for a robust international response. International standards developed by IEC, ISO and ITU go beyond national borders by connecting countries to global markets. They encompass global approaches that enable all countries to grow, thrive and support development for years to come,” concluded Chaesub Lee, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau.\nThe Riyadh International Standards Summit was jointly organized by Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO) together with IEC, ISO and ITU. The event was arranged by SASO and the G20 Saudi Secretariat as part of the International Conferences Programme honouring the G20 Saudi presidency year 2020. It forms part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s efforts, during its presidency, to enhance cooperation between countries of the world in various fields.\nAbout the G20 process\nThe Group of Twenty, or G20, is the premier forum for international economic cooperation. It brings together the leaders of leading economies on Earth.\nCollectively, G20 members represent around 80 % of the world’s economic output, two-thirds of the global population and three-quarters of international trade. Throughout the year, representatives from G20 countries gather to discuss financial and socio-economic issues as well as broader humanitarian issues targeted by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals."

        "content": "The IEC 61850 global conference initiated by the smartgrid forum event organisers, and which took place virtually on October 28 and 29 2020, was an opportunity for IEC experts inside technical committee 57, utility representative and vendors to come together and share their experiences of working on and with these core standards for modernizing and automating the grid.\nDistributed energy resources and microgrids\nAmong the IEC experts, Laurent Guise, who heads the TC 57 working group which prepares standards more specifically related to distributed energy resources (DER) and their interoperation with smart grids, made a presentation on the standardization work regarding the integration of microgrids in the energy network. He presented the second edition of IEC 61850-7-420, a new and ambitious model extension of IEC 61850 which aims to cover standard interfaces for the operation of different types and configurations of DERs. The work is led by Frances Cleveland who also heads working group 15 inside TC 57. The standard will notably specify DER operational functions, including grid support codes based on IEEE 1547, EN 50549 and IEC 62786 Standards. It also paves the way for the physical and virtual aggregation of DERs. According to Guise, the recursive model of DERs in the standard can support microgrids. “A microgrid is a DER which can run even if disconnected to the grid,” he said. The working group has been collaborating with IEC TC 8 on use case scenarios. Additional elements will be added in the standard to support microgrid specificities, notably voltage and state management, both islanded and grid connected. The new standard is currently in the final draft stages and should be released soon.\nRobust end-to-end cyber security\nFrance Cleveland, who heads working group 15, which prepares standards for data and communications security relating to the smart grid, presented the IEC 62351 Standards for cyber security and how they fit in with the IEC 61850 series, with the focus of assuring robust end-to-end security. “We did not want to reinvent the wheel, there are many cyber security standards out there, so the main question we tried to answer is how to use the standards and where,” she said.\nThe standards need to not only prevent cyber attacks but identify unintentional mistakes or even mechanical failures which can lead to the same effects, i.e. prevent the grid from functioning properly. Resilience is one of the fundamental concepts which needs to be addressed by cyber security standards for the power and energy sector. Security solutions must be end-to-end and layered so that if one layer is breached, the next will be there to prevent the attack. “We have a lot of standards that specify what is needed for cyber security but not how to implement cyber security in the energy environment,” Cleveland explains. Which is precisely where the IEC 62351 Standards come in. “Their aim is to define guidelines for security of the communication protocols specified by IEC TC 57 but also to develop standards on wider end-to-end security issues.”\nAn example of how IEC 62351 standards work with IEC 61850 is IEC 62351-6 which provides security for IEC 61850 peer-to-peer profiles. The standard was developed to secure the operation of all communication protocols based on or derived from IEC 61850, including those defined in IEC 61850-8-1, IEC 61850-9-2 and IEC 61850-6."

Obvious benefits to carrying out all the phases in one space include enhanced content quality, user guidance and version management, as well as the ability to work more collaboratively throughout the process.\nProject receives positive feedback from IEC/ISO reference groups\nThe IEC reference group and ISO external user groups together with IEC/ISO project teams spent time building and validating a tool which would be ready for pilots to start using to draft standards. Starting 12 October, an online environment for standards developers in which they can work efficiently and collaboratively was made available to IEC/ISO pilot groups. This achievement could not have been a success without the contribution of the IEC reference group and ISO external user groups.\nFeedback shaping the technology\nIEC reference group and ISO external user groups were exposed to the new tool and provided their vital user experience and feedback to help the IEC/ISO project team include all the necessary features of the tool to ensure a successful experience for the next group of users: the pilot groups. Much has already been incorporated and will continue to be worked on to address the needs of standards authors.\nParticipants commented:\n“Formula handwriting worked surprisingly well.”\n“Everything worked pretty well, adding of references and cross references is a very nice feature.”\n“I didn’t have to use the knowledge base, because after a while I found the functionality.”\n“Great to have some rules indicated in the template”\nUseful features which save time and increase accuracy\nAuthors who work on long standards documents with text, tables, graphics and other elements spend a lot of time on layout aspects using Word. For example, if sections of text or formulas are moved around, the subsequent renumbering must be done manually. The new tool offers auto-numbering which can save a lot of time and improve accuracy.\nReferencing is made easy. Authors can add references to standards or other literature by browsing the catalogue and select an existing reference or add a new one, or search for the standard reference and type key words. The reference is inserted in the text and will be added automatically to the normative references or the bibliography.\nLearn more about these features and follow the project here."

        "content": "According to the renowned architect Norman Foster, “Cities are the future of our society – of our civilisation. The words are interchangeable – civic, civilised, cities, citizens. We all know that the world is urban but, in 30 years’ time, 2.5 billion more people will live in cities.” As noted by the UN, more than half of the world’s population lives in cities and the number is expected to grow.\nHowever, to ensure sustainable urban development, cities will need tools to help manage their growth. Technology can offer solutions that help improve the quality of life of its residents and improve city services, resilience and sustainability.\nFor example, IoT, distributed computing and artificial intelligence can be used to collect and analyze data to ensure improved services and infrastructure. 3D city models with the dynamic data gathered using sensors can help better understand how residents make use of their city and enable city planning to reflect real-life requirements.\nStandards have a key role in ensuring that the technologies adopted are competitively priced, effective and interoperable. They also provide clear descriptions of best practice and enable common approaches to tackle common challenges.\nStandards are already vital to cities used for energy grids, lighting, transport and city services. The IEC has identified over 1800 standards that already impact smart cities.\nWorld Cities Day\nThe United Nations has designated 31 October as World Cities Day with the aim of highlighting the challenges and opportunities with global. This year, the theme will focus on Valuing Our Communities and Cities and calls for the engagement with local communities for the development of the cities of the future.\nThis theme corresponds the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 which calls for cities to be inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This requires, however, for those involved in the development of cities to work together to find the best solutions.\nCooperation is needed\nRecognizing the importance of collaboration in the development of solutions that enable cities to become smarter, IEC is a member of the World Smart Cities Joint Taskforce together with ISO and ITU.\nLearning from the Covid-19 pandemic was been selected as the topic for the first meeting of the Taskforce held in early October. The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of cities which have been at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic and have faced dire consequences.\nThe lessons learnt from Covid-19 is now shaping standardization work so that cities can be better prepared the next time a pandemic strikes. Because this work within ISO, ITU and IEC is still at the early stages of development, it can serve as an impetus for greater collaboration in standardization in the area of smart cities.\nAdopting a systems approach\nThe IEC has taken a systems approach to smart cities with the aim of providing a holistic approach to address complex situations. The SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of various IEC committees as well as other groups with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems."

An electrical insulating material has negligibly low electric conductivity and is used to separate conducting parts for safety reasons.\nThe standard specifies the method of test for the determination of the proof and comparative tracking indices of solid insulating materials on pieces taken from parts of equipment and on plaques of material using alternating voltage. The document notably provides a procedure for the determination of erosion when required.\nThis is a basic safety publication which focuses on a safety test method and is primarily intended to be used by technical committees in the preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51.\nThe new edition includes a number of changes with the previous standard, including the introduction of a screening test, as some materials can withstand high test voltages, but fail at lower test voltages."

        "content": "A webinar to discuss standardization for AI, which also considered requirements for high risk AI systems and conformity assessment and governance was organized by the European Commission on 29 September.\nWael William Diab leads the IEC and ISO work in standardization for artificial intelligence and gave an update during the event.\n“It was a great forum with diverse participants in the standards development space. I was pleased to give an update on the joint work of IEC and ISO in SC 42. We are developing horizontal international standards for the entire AI ecosystem”, said Diab.\nParticipants from the Council of Europe, UNESCO, OECD and standards development bodies, ISO/IEC, ITU, CEN/CENELEC, IEEE and ETSI shared their perspectives and latest standards work on AI.\nEuropean Commission representatives welcomed the progress presented by ISO/IEC in the AI standardisation field.\nFuture cooperation between standardization organisations and the European Commission is key to ensure that future standards can serve regulatory purposes and hence support the AI framework in the EU.\nThe Commission signalled that its intention is to strengthen ties with standardisation organisations in order to ensure that high-quality standards can be made available to AI providers and the AI community by the time the AI framework will be applicable.\nApproach to AI standardization and latest developments\nThe purpose of the webinar was to look at the state of play and approach to AI standardization, including what should the approach be, where are the gaps and how should they be addressed, what are the best ways to link EU efforts for standardization and possible regulation of AI with relevant activities in the rest of the world and should there be increased coordination between relevant standardization activities.\nHigh-risk AI systems requirements\nDiab presented the work of IEC and ISO joint technical committee, SC 42 during session 2 on the requirements for high-risk AI systems.\n“We are a systems integration committee and we’ve grown to having 47 national bodies that participate in our work and about 21 active projects. We have established liaisons with many of the colleagues on the call today, including the EC and OECD over the past year. We also have a lot of collaboration internally, for example our work on AI and functional safety with IEC TC 65, and the extension of the square requirements for software engineering with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7. We are seeing interest in both the technical aspects addressing issues coming up with AI as well as contextual ones like ethics and bias and so on”, said Diab.\nSC 42 is structured with six working groups (WGs) including: AI foundational standards,  data standards related AI, Big Data and analytics, trustworthiness, use cases and applications, computational approaches and characteristics, and a joint WG on governance implications of AI with SC 40, which covers IT Service Management and IT Governance.\n“There has been a lot of discussion on the idea of technical standards as well as the context of use of the technology SC 42 is taking that approach from the ecosystem. We are trying to assimilate the requirements from a technical perspective on the context of use of AI big data analytics by looking at some of these requirements from the application domain or regulatory or emerging societal and ethical requirements. We provide guidance to IEC and ISO committees looking at AI applications. IEC and ISO have many TCs that are looking at different application domains at various stages of roadmapping for AI inclusion”, said Diab.\nFind out more about SC 42 achievements and new work for trustworthiness, approach to ethics and management systems standards in the full article."

        "content": "The Secretary of IECEE and IECRE, Wolfram Zeitz, participated in the panel discussion on global cyber security standards during the Cybersecurity Perspectives virtual event organized by Eaton on 26 October.\nThe panel was moderated by Kevin Lippert, Manager of Codes and Standards at Eaton and President of the US National Committee to the IEC. Other participants included UL Identity Management and Security, ISA Global Alliances and Consortia and Eaton Cyber security.\nGlobal challenges need global solutions\n“Cyber security is a global challenge which need global solutions. Rules and policies should preferably be based on consensus-based international standards and as a second step refer to international conformity assessment systems, which already exist in the global market place, rather than finding niche solutions for every part of the world in a different way”, said Zeitz.\nIECEE – Conformity assessment recognized worldwide\nIECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components is a multilateral certification system based on IEC International Standards and provides the IEC CA cyber security services based on the IEC 62443 series of standards, which focusses on operational technology (OT) to ensure critical systems (e.g. electrical supply) operate as intended.\n“The key to the IECEE CB Scheme is that we are a global group of members. IECEE facilitates these services, our participants (National Certification Bodies and testing laboratories) do the conformity assessment and we have a mutual recognition agreement in place. Wherever a certificate is issued from one of our national certification bodies, it is a mandatory requirement of the scheme that all other CBs participating accept and recognize this certificate and offer the industry an easy roll over of the certificate into their national or company owned certification mark and scheme. This helps facilitate global market access”, explained Zeitz.\nThe need for a risk management approach\nThe moderator asked how can the international standards community react quicker to technology changes? Zeitz responded, “As an expert on the conformity assessment side, I would underline the fact that fast changing technology creates the need for standards which are not focused in detail on particular constructional or technological aspects, but rather focused on risks and risk mitigation. This approach would also enhance the applicability of Standards in an environment of fast changing technologies.”\nThe forum also included business sessions covering e-mobility – cyber security challenges and solutions; defense-in-depth – securing industrial control systems in critical infrastructure; secure electrical power monitoring systems and maritime cyber security. Technical sessions looked at cyber resiliency for distributed power applications, cyber secure supply chain, cyber security as part of lifecycle maintenance, secure by design and more."

        "content": "The Swiss magazine for the electrical industry, Bulletin, has interviewed the new IEC General Secretary and CEO. Philippe Metzger joined the IEC in February, only a short time before much of the world went into lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBulletin.ch began by asking Mr Metzger about the impact of the pandemic on his first months in office.\nBulletin: Did the lockdown earlier this year make it more difficult for you to take up your role?\nPhilipp Metzger: Yes and no. On the one hand, I was not able to establish all the personal contacts to the extent that I had planned. Admittedly, I had the good fortune to get to know the management team and most of the employees for several weeks before we went into lockdown. As far as the members of the IEC are concerned, however, there is still some catching up to do.               \nOn the other hand, the fact that the IEC has been operating electronically for many years and that parts of our IT infrastructure were rebuilt not long ago has enabled us to make a seamless transition to working online. Our internal Business Continuity Taskforce, which we set up at short notice and which is very agile, also plays an important role here.\nHow has the IEC changed under your leadership?\nI have been in office for a relatively short time. I did not start out with the ambition of turning everything upside down. In answering your question, a distinction must be made between the IEC as a member-driven organization and the secretariat, the so-called Central Office. In the latter, we are implementing a new management structure and new management and cooperation processes. In addition, numerous processes will have to be digitalized.\nOf course, as far as the organization as a whole is concerned, adapting to the demands of the pandemic has been a defining factor in recent months. Another key potential change vector, which was already being considered before my election, is the review of our governance.\nThis project is of great importance and takes up a lot of my time. It is about ensuring that we have decision-making structures and processes that are fit for the future. The IEC is an association under Swiss law, and our members must feel that they are protected by the statutes and procedural regulations and are involved in the decision-making process.\nWhat developments are still pending at the IEC?\nWe will have to pay more attention to addressing and motivating additional stakeholders, while promoting the awareness of the IEC and the use of IEC standards and conformity assessment systems in the IEC.\nIn this context, the societal importance of the IEC must be emphasized more strongly. To achieve this, we need to establish clear links between broad public issues and the work of the IEC — our true hallmark, thanks to the vast knowledge of our 20,000 or so experts.\n \nYou can read the full interview (in German) here"

        "abstract": "The new edition of an IEC International Standard helps in the fight against nuclear trafficking.",
        "content": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN agency that works to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies and which sets global safety standards for nuclear energy, received notifications of nearly 190 incidents of nuclear and other radioactive material being out of regulatory control in 2019. These include cases of trafficking and other criminal activities.\nConcerns and solutions\nConcerns about a nuclear “black market” have increased in the last few years particularly in view of its terrorist potential. In 2002, in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, the IAEA released three technical guidance documents, related to the detection and identification of special nuclear materials and security trends, sponsored by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).\nNuclear instrumentation companies are developing and manufacturing radiation instrumentation to assist in the detection of illicit movement of radioactive and special nuclear materials. This type of instrumentation is widely used for security purposes at nuclear facilities, border control checkpoints and international seaports and airports. To ensure that measurement results made at different locations are consistent, it is imperative that radiation instrumentation be designed to rigorous specifications based upon agreed performance requirements established in international standards. And that’s where IEC work comes in.\nIEC Standard for equipment used at border controls\nIEC has been cooperating with the IAEA for many years. One of its technical committees, TC 45, prepares standards relating to nuclear energy and materials. Its subcommittee, SC 45 B, develops specific documents relating to the illicit trafficking detection and identification of radionuclides.\nThe SC has just released the second edition of IEC 62484 which defines the performance requirements of installed monitors used for the detection and identification of gamma emitters and the detection of neutron radiation emitters. These monitors are commonly known as spectrometric radiation portal monitors or SRPMs.\nThey are used to monitor vehicles, cargo containers, people or packages and are typically used at national and international border crossings and ports of entry. SRPMs may be used at any location where there is a need for this type of monitoring. The document establishes the general, radiological, climatic, mechanical, electric and electromagnetic and documentation requirements and associated test methods.\nThis second edition comprises important changes compared to the previous standard, including consistency with new standards for the detection of illicit trafficking of radioactive materials as well as the addition of important information concerning climatic exposure."

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how quickly our lives can be upended. The closures of businesses, schools and stores moved many activities from the physical to the digital environment.\nGovernments imposed rules to protect the health and safety of their citizens which have included measures such as wearing masks, disinfecting public spaces and the contract tracing of those who may have been in the vicinity of an infected individual.\nWhile we assess the impact of Covid-19, preparations are underway should another health emergency strike. As part of this preparation, standard developers are now considering how standards can offer guidance on available methods that are available to prevent and control a future pandemic.\nIEC has recently approved two new work items that will facilitate how administrators can manage future public health emergencies in cities.\nMapping relevant standards\nThis new work item, currently referred to as IEC TS 63233-4, will identify relevant standards for epidemic prevention and control, emergency management and resource scheduling that will be categorized in a database for easy use by public officials, citizens and other relevant stakeholders.\nThe standards in the database will cover topics such as patient care, personal medical protection, the sterilization and disinfection of public places and the deployment of emergency resources.\nBy developing this inventory, standards development organizations will be able to determine where there may be duplications or gaps among existing standards.\nAccording to Yongchao Gao “It is urgent to implement an approach of standards inventory and mapping for public health emergencies. This will help us to use standardized procedures and products to fight a global pandemic and protect the health and safety of citizens”.\nThe proposed standard is part of a series of standards on the inventory and mapping of standards for smart cities.\nCollecting use cases\nThis new work item will describe and analyse scenarios of how smart cities can best respond to public health emergencies and strengthen their Urban Immune System. It will provide use case from around the world in order to better understand how to prevent, control and manage the public health emergencies as well as how to handle the longer-term effects that they may cause.\nThe use-cases will consider a wide range of scenarios that address management challenges as well as the available solutions that rely on technology such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\nAccording to the project leader for this work item, Biyu Wan, “Many important lessons are being learned and shared around the world as we tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. To ensure that we do not forget these them, this new work item will facilitate the incorporation of these lessons into international standards which can then be used to strengthen urban immune systems against the next public health emergency”.\nBoth of these proposed standards are being developed by the IEC Systems Committee on Smart cities and are expected to be published in 2023."

The programme increases the awareness, adoption and implementation of IEC Standards and allows countries to benefit from the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nLocated in the southern part of Africa, Namibia has participated in the IEC Affiliate Programme since 2001. Namibia has now adopted 59 IEC International Standards and participates in the work of 14 IEC technical committees and subcommittees\nRojas Manyame has been President of the NEC from Namibia since April 2013. e-tech recently spoke with Rojas to learn more about the experience of his country in the IEC Affiliate Programme.\nWhat are the biggest benefits for Namibia in participating in this programme?\nParticipation in this programme has helped Namibia through the adoption of standards, through our participation in influencing the standardization process and through the Affiliate Conformity Assessment Status (ACAS) which allows us to participate in the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nIn terms of our operations, these standards assist quite a lot. I have first-hand experience in terms of our regulatory environment and we have incorporated most of the IEC Standards. IEC has definitely gone a long way to assist us.\nWhat are the biggest challenges for Namibia in terms of standardisation and conformity assessment?\nThe availability and mobility of experts is our biggest challenge. We have about ten mirror committees and we are trying to find experts for these committees and to participate in these technical committees.\nIn Namibia, we have adopted standards and put them in place. Moving forward, however, we need to be able to contribute to the standardization process. While I do not foresee us doing that in the near future, it is a goal for the future.\nIn the terms of the application of standards, I think we are doing quite well. We are not just adopting standards for the sake of doing so but also based on the needs of our industry.\nWhat is the role of standardisation in helping to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?\nStandardisation is very important because standards provide the foundation for countries and industries to adopt and build sustainable technologies. Standards also form the basis for innovation. Each party will not just be doing what they want but will be able to rely upon applied best practices. Standards are also very important for quality and risk management.\nIn terms of the SDGs, sustainability, innovation and quality and risk management are important. Standards are available to address each of these areas.\n \nRead the full interview in e-tech"

        "abstract": "Protecting the planet with standards is the theme of this year’s World Standards Day. IEC cooperates with a number of specialist environmental organizations, including ECOS.",
        "content": "Protecting the planet with standards, the theme of this year’s World Standards Day, highlights the important role of standards in helping to minimize the negative consequences that human activity can have on the planet.\nAs part of its standardization activities, the IEC cooperates with a number of environmental organizations, such as ECOS, the European Environmental Citizen’s Organisation for Standardization, for their expertise in areas such as energy efficiency, household appliances and power management systems.\nFor World Standards Day, the IEC interviewed Justin Wilkes, the Executive Director of ECOS, to understand better the positive role that standardization can have on the environment.\nHow can standards help protect the environment?\nStandards help make sure that the products we use every day are safe and reliable. But they can also have an enormous influence on how products are made, and services are provided, with the potential to facilitate the transition to a greener and more circular economy.\nStandards can make home appliances and devices more energy-efficient and repairable, create ways to reuse and recycle electronic waste, or set incentives to ensure we do not design environmental problems into our products. Standards manage the world around us, and it is vital that they address environmental concerns.\nWhat are some areas where standards have made a positive impact on the environment?\nFor example, standards have shown to be helpful for safer and healthier alternatives to toxic chemicals, and improved standards paved the way to cleaner products, for example, IEC 60065, IEC 60950, and IEC 62368.\nAnother example is what we highlighted in our discussion paper Approaches to address circumvention of ecodesign and energy label requirements, where we mention that IEC TC 59 Internal Guide – The Principles of the Work of IEC TC 59 and its SCs, Edition 4 (ref 59/674/INF) was a leading tool to addressing the challenge of circumvention.\nAnd what are some areas where more work is necessary?\nIt is crucial to ensure standards do not inherently hinder the uptake of environmentally friendly solutions. They need to allow for and foster the use of green alternatives, for instance in the case of natural refrigerants. If a standard puts limits on the amount of, say, natural refrigerants that a product can contain, in practice, it promotes the use of gases which contribute to climate change.\nThis is where the IEC needs to act, as they are still part of the problem sometimes: they need to urgently set out a plan of action on how it will work with environmental stakeholders to ensure its standards are not market barriers to cleaner greener solutions to climate change.\nIt is vital to go beyond the usual “common denominator” approach in standards-making and universally raise the ambition of standards so that they are compatible with international environmental objectives such as the Paris Agreement and Montreal Protocol.\nThe concept of a circular economy is gaining traction. How can standards address it?\nStandards have a great potential to foster circularity. They can provide common formats and designs that reduce the use of materials, as well as unnecessary waste generation. In addition, standards can provide the definitions and terminology to be used when it comes to circularity strategies, such as modularity, adaptability, repairability, reusability, upgradeability… and lay out the criteria necessary to verify circularity claims in products and systems. The IEC’s Environmentally Conscious Design approach (IEC TC 111) could allow the IEC to be one of the circular economy trendsetters.\nStandards can also help make products more repairable but also prepare them for reuse and recycling. Imagine a modular appliance, where spare parts are readily available, and critical raw materials easy to extract after the product’s life is over. All of this can be achieved with standards.\nHow do ECOS and IEC benefit from working together?\nECOS consistently works to make sure the environment has a strong voice at the table where standards are developed because we strongly believe that environmentally ambitious standards are essential tools to prevent a climate breakdown.\nBut of course, we cannot do this alone: we need leadership from within the standardization community, particularly from the IEC. Only by working together can we make sure that future standards really protect our planet – and we still have quite a long way to go. IEC standards would be more robust and of higher quality if they were developed more inclusively, and ECOS is the only organization globally that offers exclusively environmental expertise to the standardization system."

        "content": "The IEC, ISO and ITU announce the winners of the annual World Standards Day contest. This year, a poster contest was launched, along the theme of Protecting the planet with standards.\nParticipants were asked to think about how international standards help to promote sustainability, for instance by preparing the ground for renewable energy usage and integration into the electricity grid. International standards also pave the way for circular economy processes, including the recycling and reuse of materials, as well as providing benchmarks for energy efficiency in multiple devices and systems.\nThe following message from the three organizers helped to guide the participants:\n“To reduce human impact on our planet, we need the political will, concrete action and the right tools. International standards are one such tool. The international standards prepared by IEC, ISO and ITU take into account tried and tested solutions to technical challenges. They help share expertise and expert know-how broadly within developed and developing countries alike. Standards cover all aspects of energy savings, water and air quality. They lay down standardized protocols and methods of measurement. Their broad use helps reduce the environmental impact of industrial production and processes, facilitates the reuse of limited resources and improves energy efficiency.”\nWorld Standards Day is an opportunity to pay tribute to the collaborative efforts of the thousands of experts worldwide who develop the voluntary technical agreements that are published as international standards.\nResults\nOver 400 submissions were received this year, of which the three organizations shortlisted seven that were put up for public vote.\nThe winner is Jyoti Bisht from India, a designer at Tata Consultancy Services.\n“In my poster, I created a wide variety of modern utilities such as electric cars, alternate sources of energy, and many more, all of which leave little to zero footprint on our planet when they are used by us, because they comply with international standards. Thus, I wanted to send out a message that, by using such products which follow international standards, we can protect our planet from irreversible damage provoked by carbon emissions and greenhouse gases,” she explains.\nThe two runners-up are Avishek Sahoo from India and Mohsen Jafari from the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nCongratulations to all three on their creativity and insight.\nCheck out the winning poster on the World Standards Cooperation website."

        "content": "Disaster risk governance is the theme of this year’s International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction held on 13 October. According to the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, “Bad situations only get worse without good disaster risk governance”.\nBecause electricity is the backbone operating much of modern life, cities need to put in place a plan of action to ensure the continued supply of electricity after a disaster strikes. Hurricanes, earthquakes, severe droughts, and flooding are some of the natural catastrophes that are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These events can have a devastating impact on cities and the many services that rely upon electricity.\nThe IEC recently published IEC 63152 which serves as a best practice tool for city planners. Given the increased frequency of natural disasters and the destruction they cause, this standard proposes guidelines to sustain a variety of city services following a disruption.\nAccording to Tatsuya Shimoji, who serves as Project Leader for the IEC SyC Smart city project team on city service continuity, “We need to ask ourselves: if such a big disaster happens, how can we, as a city, survive? This is the concept that we are trying to address.”\nContinuity planning is a key factor to minimize cost and damage should critical infrastructure become inoperable. It ensures that potential disasters have been considered and local plans developed for the restoration of services. Because no city service can operate without electricity, getting the electricity supply to function again is the most urgent and important task following a disaster.\nAs Shimoji notes, “With this standard, we want to provide documented procedures to guide organizations and ensure the continuity of electricity supply to maintain city services. In order to secure services in a city at a minimum level during grid power loss due to a disaster, each organization which provides services should establish a business continuity plan to secure its electricity supplies appropriately.”\nPlanning and preparation is essential\nNatural disasters, which can happen in any region of the world, have caused blackouts. Non-natural disasters, such as cyber and terrorist attacks, can also threaten a city’s electricity supply. And, as COVID-19 had demonstrated, we rely upon electricity for survival.\nAs Shimoji notes, “Disaster prevention is important. But, unfortunately, we cannot foresee when and where such a disaster will happen, nor can we completely escape the effects and damages caused by a disaster in reality. So, planning and preparation become very important tools to minimize the damage and keep city services available as much as is possible or to allow for the recovery of services as quickly as possible.”"

        "content": "The online standards development pilot groups will start using the new tool to draft standards. Participants include technical committee secretaries, assistant secretaries working groups, and maintenance team convenors, project team leaders, project leaders and experts.\nThe tool aims to create an online environment for standards developers to work efficiently and collaboratively, facilitate comment management in preparation for consensus gathering, as well as offer new value-added products and services that are relevant for the world of tomorrow.\n“We’re really looking forward to this phase and receiving the participant feedback. It is their chance to help us make the new online tool as effective as possible for IEC standards and the broader standards development community”, said Anja Bielfeld, Business Analyst and coordinating the IEC side of the project.\nThe joint project with ISO and CEN/CENELEC, has reached an important milestone. Three IEC pilot groups will start using the tool to write their standards.\nThe groups will choose between:\n\nAll-in-authoring – everyone in the group can create and review content by commenting. This option is probably best for small groups under 20 people, who work closely together. Comments will be resolved by group consensus and members should decide who works on what section.\n\t \nSelective authoring – selected people only can create the content and everyone can comment on it. This might be best for large groups. Permissions will manage which member can author content.\n\nParticipant feedback is key to the success of this stage. The feedback will help the project developers improve the features of the tool to make it as intuitive and useful a tool as possible.\nWhy change the way we write standards?\nThe process of drafting IEC publications, including International Standards, Technical Specifications and Technical Reports is time consuming and involves the input of many people from around the world, who contribute to the different stages.\nIn the current MS Word environment, authors, editors and those involved in the commenting phase face many challenges, such as versioning of documents, collaboration, resolution of commenting, maintenance of the tool (some Word features are no longer supported), lack of customization possibilities and the need to spend a lot of time on formatting, which takes the focus away from the content.\nAdditionally, the format does not allow semantic enrichment or single-source publishing and therefore doesn’t integrate well with a future-oriented production chain.\n“There are many features in the new tool which will facilitate the drafting and editing of standards, such as automatic numbering of clauses and tables, in-line validation of the author’s referencing to published standards and contextual help concerning drafting rules. The navigation and search features make it very easy to find and edit content”, said Alisdair Menzies, Editing manager who serves as the authoring specialist in the IEC project team.\nIn our next update, find out more about some of the time-saving features of the new online standards development tool."

        "content": "Saturday October 10 is World Health Mental Day. The overall objective of the day is to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and mobilize efforts in support of mental health.\nAccording to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), around one in four people in the world is affected by a form of mental disorder. These disorders include depression, schizophrenia and, increasingly, dementia.\nThe WHM Day focuses this year on the detrimental effects of COVID-19, as people with mental health conditions feel particularly isolated and fragile during the pandemic. Tools helping them to keep in touch with their entourage during confinement periods are particularly useful. They are key in preventing suicides by enabling medical staff to keep daily contact with patients at home, as well as helping institutionalized patients to keep contact with their families.\nOne of the striking revelations of this extraordinary period we are still living through is that active assisted living (AAL) services, which can be defined as systems and equipment which help senior citizens and people with disabilities or mental conditions to live independently at home, have saved many lives while costing less in terms of care.\nIEC is leading the way in developing standards relating to AAL services. It set up a systems committee, IEC SyC AAL, to promote safety, security, privacy and cross-vendor interoperability in the use of AAL services.  The SyC recently published IEC 63234-1,  which establishes a framework for the economic evaluation of AAL services. IEC TC 100 develops standards for audio, video and multimedia systems. The TC set up a technical area (TA) to address aspects of AAL technology.\nTreatment in a virtual world\nNew digital technologies are also helping to treat some conditions, such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an innovative fashion and can sometimes be adapted to home use.\nOne of the successful ways of treating PTSD is by using virtual reality (VR) to make people relive their traumatic experiences time and time again, until they no longer feel any form of stress or anxiety. This technology has been used for war veterans who, equipped with headsets, revisit the dangerous zones they were deployed in, for instance. VR headsets can be used at home and patients can be carefully monitored through telemedicine tools.\n VR can also be used to treat depression and anxiety by enabling patients to experience a particularly pleasant and relaxing environment. For example, VR programmes allowing people to virtually swim in the sea with dolphins have had beneficial effects on depressive tendencies.\nIEC has formed a joint technical committee with ISO, JTC 1, which prepares standards for information technology. One of its subcommittees publishes documents which specify the requirements for augmented reality (AR) and VR. IEC TC 110 publishes standards for electronic displays. One of its working groups has developed the first edition of IEC 63145-20-20, which establishes the measurement conditions for determining the image quality of eyewear displays.\nFor more information about mental health and technology, read: Mind games."

Recent developments in technology and data collection have opened new opportunities and accelerated the possibility to improve the quality of life for city residents and provide more sustainable and resilient solutions.\nRecognizing the importance of collaboration in the development of solutions that enable cities to become smarter, IEC participated in the inaugural meeting of the World Smart Cities Joint Taskforce together with ISO and ITU.\nLeveraging the World Smart City Forum\nIn 2016, IEC organized the first edition of the World Smart City Forum which was held in Singapore and brought together a broad range of experts from around the world. Recognizing the importance of this cooperation, two further editions of the World Standards Forum were organized under the leadership of ISO in 2017 and ITU in 2018.\nThe conditions created by the World Smart City Forums enabled a conversation between standards development organizations in a collaborative environment. These forums were also the impetus for this new joint taskforce on smart cities which has been approved by the governing boards for the three organizations.\nLearning from the pandemic\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of cities. They have been at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic and have faced dire consequences. It is estimated that 95% of total cases are in urban areas.\nThe lessons learnt from Covid-19 is now shaping standardization work so that cities can be better prepared the next time a pandemic strikes. Because this work within ISO, ITU and IEC is still at the early stages of development, it can serve as an impetus for greater collaboration in standardization in the area of smart cities.\nLearning from the Covid-19 pandemic has been selected as the topic for the first meeting of the IEC-ISO-ITU Joint Smart Cities Taskforce.\nMandate for the first meeting\nAccording to IEC General Secretary & CEO Philippe Metzger, “The IEC recognizes the need to join forces with ISO and ITU to ensure that standardization solutions for smart cities are comprehensive, eliminate gaps between our respective work areas and strive for meaningful synergies.” He called on participants to engage in substantial collaboration that will produce concrete results.\n“We have a dual opportunity here: to engage with society with a view to addressing societal needs and identify areas of standardization work and to enhance and foster the collaboration between our three organization. I am counting on you to make that happen.”"

        "content": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming mainstream in our cities as an increasing number of people opt for this cleaner mean of transport. One of the less known advantages of EVs is that they can potentially be used to store energy and deliver power to the grid instead of or in conjunction with other electrical energy storage systems in emergencies or during sporadic supply shortages. Leveraging a two-way flow of electricity from EV battery storage to balance power supply and demand could also help global efforts to integrate more renewables in the power mix. EVs could charge when renewable energy generation from wind or the sun is high or when there is lower demand for electricity (e.g. when people are sleeping). \nWhen used in that way, EVs become distributed energy resources (DERs), like a solar panel on a roof, a microgrid or a battery storage system. DERs are energy sources situated close to the end user. These edge devices are becoming widespread as more and more household and businesses adopt locally produced renewable energy systems. These systems must be integrated into the electricity grid in a way which does not impact electricity delivery, despite the fluctuating resources of some renewable systems such as wind or solar.\nSyC Smart Energy involvement is crucial\nThe IEC Systems Committee on Smart Energy (SyC Smart Energy) was established to coordinate the work of several  IEC Technical Committees and subcommittees working to publish standards relating to the digitalization, automating and modernization of the grid, including the integration of grid edge devices and systems.\nThis work is particularly relevant when it comes to EVs and their capability as DERs. Various committees are working together, encouraged by the SyC Smart Energy. The emphasis is very much on avoiding the replication of standards and identifying gaps where new standards are needed, as well as generally fostering a culture of regular exchange of information between the different committees involved.\nThey  include IEC TC 57 which publishes key standards paving the way for smart grids such as the IEC 61850 series; IEC TC 69 which issues key standards pertaining to the charging of EVs, such as IEC 63119; IEC TC 8 which prepares standards on overall system aspects of electricity supply systems; IEC TC 13 which publishes standards for smart meters; IEC SC 23 K working on electrical energe efficiency products and  IEC TC 120 which develops standards for electrical energy storage systems.  \nAs the Chair of SyC Smart Energy Richard Schomberg highlighted during a recent workshop with the above mentioned: “The discussion between the various committees is to be directed from the viewpoint of the users of the standards.” The users are indeed the first ones to benefit from such a system-fostered approach. Coordinated work between these various IEC expert groups can also be viewed as a blueprint for other committees to follow.\nThe workshop, which took place on September 16, intends to support a process to provide a set of deliverables to industry stakeholders in the shortest time. As a result, the various committees have agreed to coordinate and communicate better regarding their contribution to true end-to-end standardized solutions, for example IEC TC 8 and IEC TC 57 have agreed to cooperate on grid codes for interconnection to the grid, and TC 69 as well as TC 57 and TC 8, to get more expertise and input from IEC TC 13 on financial metering. Participants were also keen to meet for another follow-up workshop early in the new year.\nMore information about SyC Smart Energy and its TCs/SCs Forum on Electric Vehicles as Distributed Energy Storage Systems (EV-DESS) will be made available at its web page www. syc-se.iec.ch"

        "content": "The theme of this year’s World Teachers Day, which falls on 5 October, is the vital role played by teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Helping students adjust to distance learning is one of the many challenges that teachers have faced in 2020.\nThe pandemic caused governments to close schools and tertiary institutions overnight, and rethink how to deliver education. It also raised questions, such as how equipped are learning institutions to carry out entire curriculums remotely and how will learners be assessed, and teaching happen in this new set up?\nHow do families without the appropriate hardware and/or an Internet connection manage? Months later, we are still living with the pandemic and its spikes.\n“The education sector wasn’t ready for COVID 19, which forced schools, universities and training institutions to go virtual,” says Erlend Øverby, who leads IEC and ISO joint standardization work through ISO/IEC JTC 1/ SC 36 which covers IT for learning, education and training (ITLET).\n“The learning curve has been steep, but the pandemic has raised awareness of how IT can help education and that people can learn anywhere, so long as they have access to internet and appropriate technology and teachers who are prepared to teach them virtually. We also anticipate that the increased use of on-line tools will have an impact on how schools organize their education when the COVID 19 pandemic are under control.”\nPeople who live remotely or who cannot reach school because of transport issues or a global health crisis, can be taught by someone potentially on the other side of the world, thanks to technology.\nThrough education, it is possible to improve the quality of life and create the basis for sustainable development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 Quality education, aims to ensure that all girls and boys have access to and finish their free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education.\nIt also looks to ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university regardless of gender, disability or indigenous people.\nInnovative technologies, such as virtual reality, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) are helping to increase and diversify learning opportunities for people in different situations worldwide.\nHow standards help\nInternational standards can help ensure key aspects of remote learning, such as interoperability of systems and devices used, as well as ensure data privacy.\n“Technology in itself does not provide learning, education or training. When things are put in context and managed by a ‘teacher’, then we have education,” says Øverby. “The use of technology must be put in a context that fulfils the goals of learning, education and training. Technology is nothing alone; it is how we choose to implement it that matters.”\nAs the use of online programmes, applications and devices grows rapidly it will be vital to ensure that student data and profiles created remain secure and private.\nSocial Share"

        "published_day": "2020-10-02",
        "abstract": "The global generation of e-waste grew by 9,2 Mt since 2014 and is projected to grow to 74,7 Mt by 2030 – almost doubling in only 16 years.",
        "content": "According to the global e-waste monitor 2020, in 2019, the world generated a striking 53,6 Mt of electrical and electronic waste, an average of 7,3 kg per capita. The global generation of e-waste grew by 9,2 Mt since 2014 and is projected to grow to 74,7 Mt by 2030 – almost doubling in only 16 years.\nThe monitor also underlines the inequality of e-waste disposal. In middle- and low-income countries, the e-waste management infrastructure is not yet fully developed or, in some cases, is entirely absent. Hence, e-waste is managed mostly by what some pundits call “the informal” sector. In this case, e-waste is often handled under inferior conditions, causing severe health effects to workers as well as to the children who often live, work and play near e-waste management activities.\nAccording to the monitor, while discarded products can sometimes still be refurbished and reused, and thus are usually shipped as second-hand products from high-income to low- or middle-income countries, a considerable amount of e-waste is still exported illegally or under the guise of being for reuse or pretending to be scrap metal. It can be assumed that the volume of transboundary movements of used EEE or e-waste ranges from 7 to 20% of the e-waste generated.\nEuropean standards\nIn Europe, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) has published the EN 50625 / EN 50614 series of standards on waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) based on the EU WEEE 2012 Directive which addresses producers and importers of EEE in Europe. The standards define the collection, logistics and treatment requirements, as well as preparation for re-use of WEEE.\nMany other countries such as Japan, China and the US have their own standards when it comes to e-waste. In developing nations, legislation often exists. In Ghana for instance, the Hazardous and Electronic Waste Control and Management Act was adopted in 2016. All EEE and tires coming into Ghana must pay an eco-Levy, ranging from 0.15 $/product up to 15 $/product.\nThe act was truly enforced from 2018 onwards so the impact it may have is very recent. Ghana is also home to the infamous Agbogbloshie scrap metal yard that has achieved international notoriety for the improper manner in which e-waste is processed. Methods of waste processing – especially burning – emit toxic chemicals into the air, land and water. Exposure is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system, and especially the brain. Concerns about human health and the environment of Agbogbloshie continue to be raised as the area remains heavily polluted, even if the government of Ghana has taken a series of measures to improve the situation.\nThere is therefore an identified need to extend the reach of existing transnational standards, such as the EN 50625// EN 50614 series, to include developing nations and get their input on requirements as they are affected by e-waste both in beneficial (re-use of equipment) and detrimental ways (pollution, health hazards).\nInput from developing nation needed\nUnder the guidance of its CENELEC mirror committee, IEC Technical Committee 111, which prepares international environmental standards inside the IEC, has decided to study a work new item with the aim of developing such a global standard on e-waste. It is early days yet and the task force in charge of the proposal, headed by Christian Dworak, welcomes input from all venues, and especially from developing nations.\n“Electrical and electronic products are produced and sold worldwide. E-waste does not stop at European boarders. There is a need for a worldwide basic scenario on the treatment and the preparation for reuse of e-waste. Today we have many worldwide standards produced by the IEC which deal with the ecofriendly design of electrical and electronic products. This is a very good starting point. With the new project we want to ensure that all the efforts made in the design phase will continue when dealing with the end of life of products. In order to lever the full effects of a circular economy we should focus on putting into place high quality end of life treatment processes.”\nInside the IEC, many developing nations are members, for instance Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. In addition, the IEC launched the affiliate country programme, which offers countries a form of participation in the IEC without the financial burden of actual membership, making full use of IEC 100% electronic environment. 84 countries take part in the IEC through this specific programme from Burundi to Zimbabwe.\nHowever, very few technical committees are headed by Chairs from developing nations and input on standard development from these nations is not always forthcoming. One of the objectives of Christophe Garnier, when he became Chair of IEC TC 111 in 2018, was to encourage and push for developing nation involvement.\n“The most active countries in our TC are mainly based in the northern hemisphere. I would like to encourage all our members to take part in a proactive manner. Everyone can contribute – we must get more feedback from a higher number of developing nations as well, especially on environmental issues, as their input will be crucial as we move forward,” he said."

The COVID-19 pandemic, which affects older people disproportionately, is overshadowing this year’s event.\nAccording to the WHO, the fact that older people are spending more time indoors and have less physical contact with friends and family, has had a huge impact on the quality of their lives and mental health. The WHO urges governments and institutions to take steps to “create opportunities to foster healthy ageing during the pandemic.”\nThis is a serious challenge for a world where people aged 65 or above outnumber children under five years of age. UN figures show that the share of the world’s population aged 65 years or over increased from 6 per cent in 1990 to 9 per cent in 2019.\nAccording to data from World Population Prospects: the 2019 Revision, by 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65 (16%), up from one in 11 in 2019 (9%). By 2050, one in four persons living in Europe and Northern America could be aged 65 or over. In 2018, for the first time in history, persons aged. The number of persons aged 80 years or over is projected to triple, from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050.\nThanks to international standards, new technologies could make a significant contribution. Smart devices, wearables, the Internet of Things, robots, and personal assistants are already helping older people to live independently for longer. \nIEC TC 100 develops standards for audio, video and multimedia systems. The TC set up a technical area (TA) to address aspects of active assisted living (AAL). AAL technologies include systems and devices, which support the well-being and care of disabled and older people.\nThe TA liaises with the IEC System Committee on Active Assisted Living (SyC AAL), which focuses on the standardization of AAL products, services and systems to enable independent living for AAL users. \nIEC TC 79 issues documents dealing with alarm and electronic security systems. IEC TC 47 publishes the IEC 62951 series on flexible and stretchable semiconductor devices. These standards are crucial for enabling electronic devices and sensors to be integrated in flexible patches.\nIEC TC 119 establishes requirements relating to printed electronics, which enable the creation of numerous electronic devices or components, including wearables, using various printing methods.  IEC TC 124 is specifically dedicated to developing standards pertaining to wearable electronic devices and technologies.\nThe joint technical committee established by the IEC and ISO, includes several SCs that deal with some of the core technologies. For example, SC 35 publishes ISO/IEC 30122-1, which specifies the framework and general guidance for voice command user interfaces. SC 42 prepares standards for AI, while SC 41 publishes documents relating to the Internet of Things.\nTechnology offers solutions to extend independent living through the development and smart deployment of consumer electronics and connected and wearable medical and health-related devices.  IEC Standards ensure it operates to the highest quality and safety specifications."

        "content": "According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 5,5 Gigawatt (GW) of additional nuclear capacity were connected to the grid and 9,4 GW were permanently shut down, bringing global nuclear capacity to 443 GW in 2019. New projects were launched (about 5,2 GW), and refurbishments are under way in many countries to ensure the long-term operations of the existing fleet.\n\n\n\n\nDespite these developments, the expansion of this form of energy is slowing down globally. Since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, concerns about the safety of nuclear energy have risen and some nations have opted to denuclearize, either temporarily (Japan) or permanently (Switzerland, Germany…).\nYet, according to the IEA, nuclear power has avoided about 55 Gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 emissions over the past 50 years, nearly equal to two years of global energy-related CO2 emissions.\nSafety is therefore THE prime concern for governments and the nuclear industry to ensure nuclear energy remains one of the options on the table for reducing green house gas emissions.\nNuclear power plants (NPPs) must be able to demonstrate that they deliver energy safely, securely and efficiently, now more than ever before.\nIEC work for nuclear safety\nIEC cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN agency that works to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies and which sets global safety standards for nuclear energy. Experts from IEC Technical Committee 45 take part in the technical working group on nuclear power plant instrumentation and control (TWG-NPPIC), which was founded by the IAEA in 1971 to give advice on and promote research into nuclear plant technology, notably human system interfaces. \nIEC TC 45, and more specifically one of its subcommittees, SC 45A, publishes international standards covering the entire lifecycle of the electrical and electronic control systems of nuclear power plants, from conception, through design, manufacture, test, installation, operation, maintenance, repair, modernization and decommissioning.\nCyber security standard\nThe increased use of digital technology, which goes hand in hand with the automatization of the electricity grid, makes NPPs more vulnerable to cyber criminals. This increasing threat is taken very seriously by nations and the nuclear industry itself. IEC TC 45 issued its first standard addressing cyber security issues in August 2014. It recently published a completely revised second edition of IEC 62645. The publication was developed “to prevent and/or minimize the impact of attacks against I&C programmable digital systems on nuclear safety and plant performance. It covers programme level, architectural level and system level requirements.”\nRead more in e-tech."

        "content": "Cities can benefit from the widespread use of technology and data. New technologies are available that can help cities better understand and respond to the needs of their residents. However, to fully leverage the benefits of these technologies, standards are needed. Standards for smart cities can help cities all over the world to benefit more quickly and effectively from global best practice and provide new opportunities for industry.\nIn the area of information technology, the IEC partners with ISO to develop standards for smart cities. As a result of their joint work, IEC and ISO have now published a new standard, ISO/IEC 30145-3, Information technology – Smart City ICT reference framework – Part 3: Smart city engineering framework.\nIt is the first of three standards that can be used by city information officers when planning and implementing a smart city. Each of the standards will address a different viewpoint within a city – business process, knowledge management and engineering – and focus on the needs for each one.\nAccording to Heng Qian, Convenor of the joint IEC and ISO working group on smart cities (ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 11) that developed this standard, “Comprehensive and well-thought out frameworks helps cities to make better decisions in a transparent and intelligent way. These standards are the result of international expertise and best practice and thus represent a reference that every city can benefit from.”\nISO/IEC 30145-3 describes a framework from an engineering perspective, structured in layers of ICT technologies, that are essential for the operation of a smart city. The framework also provides the mapping of the ICT techniques to various system entities so as to support the city’s business, knowledge management and operational systems.\nAs noted by Heng Qian, “The three parts of ISO/IEC 30145 give the stakeholders in a smart city a common understanding of the full framework of the city from an ICT perspective. We are pleased to now publish ISO/IEC 30145-3 and will soon make available the other two parts in this series of standards”.\nAccording to Dapeng Zhang, project leader for ISO/IEC 30145-3, “This new standard provides a solid foundation for city planners to use especially given the merger of technologies. Deployed together with ISO/IEC 30146 on smart city ICT indicators, ISO/IEC 30145 can guide the city with a better understanding of state-of-art smart city technologies”."

        "content": "The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is holding an online event on September 24 to mark World Maritime Day. The UN agency established the event to draw attention to the importance of maritime culture, maritime environment security and shipping safety. \nThe theme for this year’s World Maritime Day is “Sustainable shipping for a sustainable planet.” It aims to raise awareness about the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the work it is undertaking to achieve the targets.\nIEC work helps the IMO to achieve its SDG targets. Two IEC technical committees (TCs), in particular, are dedicated to preparing international standards for the maritime industry.IEC TC 80 contributes to SDG 14 on conserving and using seas and oceans in a sustainable way. Electrification of shipping at sea and when anchored in harbours, during loading and unloading of goods, can significantly contribute to reducing pollution and help protect marine life.\nTC 80 develops international standards for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) in agreement with the IMO. The TC prepares the IEC 61097 GMDSS series of standards relating to the various components of ship safety systems.\nThe internationally recognized procedures and communication protocols are used to increase safety and make it easier to rescue ships in distress.\nIEC TC 18 cooperates with the IMO where electrical systems on board ships are concerned. It publishes international standards in line with the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), an international maritime treaty which sets minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships.\nThe IEC 60092 series, applicable to all electrical installations on board ships, are employed worldwide by naval architects, marine engineering design and consulting companies, ship and offshore unit builders, cable and electrical equipment manufacturers, installers, classification bodies, test houses, ship owners, operators and national and international authorities.\nMany other IEC TCs develop international standards which are relevant to the maritime industry and help it plan a greener and more sustainable future. IEC also administers four conformity assessment (CA) systems that certify that components, equipment, installations and systems used in the maritime industry conform to the specifications outlined in its international standards.\nFrom artificial intelligence (AI) to the Internet of Things (IoT) and from energy efficient technologies to increased digitization and cyber security, IEC work is essential in laying the groundwork for the shipping industry to continue to prosper alongside the demands of our time.\nIEC plays a key role in ensuring that the increasingly complex electrical and electronic devices used for shipping work together safely, efficiently and have a limited impact on the environment. IEC Standards also pave the way for new technologies to be used by the shipping industry, in a way that will prepare it to meet future challenges head on."

        "published_day": "2020-09-23",
        "abstract": "Technology touches most aspects of daily life and brings many benefits to diverse fields, including education and training.",
        "content": "For example, it can lower costs and adapt applications and programmes to individual needs and preferences.\n“If more people have access to high quality educational resources and tools, it becomes easier to meet the goal of UN SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. With support of standards, technology has the potential of meeting these requirements within education,” said Overby, during the International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD 2020) this week.\nOverby is Chair of ISO/IEC SC 36 for Learning, Education and Training (ITLET), and participated in the session on ICT standards for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SC 36 standardization activities, which cover all aspects from formal education within schools and higher education, to training within industry and lifelong learning.\nCOVID 19 has put the spotlight on tech for education\nCOVID-19 caused governments to close schools and tertiary institutions overnight, and rethink how to deliver education. It also raised questions, such as how equipped are learning institutions to carry out entire curriculums remotely and how will learners be assessed, and teaching happen in this new set up? How do families without the appropriate hardware and/or an Internet connection manage? Seven months on, we live with the pandemic and its spikes.\n“The education sector wasn’t ready for COVID 19, which forced schools, universities and training institutions to go virtual. The learning curve has been steep, but the pandemic has raised awareness of how IT can help education and that people can learn anywhere, so long as they have access to internet and appropriate technology and teachers who are prepared to teach them virtually. We also anticipate that the increased use of on-line tools will have an impact on how schools organize their education when the COVID 19 pandemic are under control.”\nBenefits of global education standards\nAs IT becomes an integrated part of all aspects of our educational systems, there is an increased need for systems to exchange information about their learners, educators, curriculums, learning goals, grades and badges, achievements, attendance, and all other aspects of the schools activities, And support educators, while following learners as their education evolves in different educational institutions.\nGlobal standards for interoperability between systems would mean that providers would only need to create one integration point for each service. This would lower costs and increase flexibility when choosing a service provider.\n“In the longer run we’ll see the huge benefits of technology that supports teachers, students, parents and schools by providing tools that can be tailored to specific needs. There will be more vendors of educational IT tools and apps, more data being produced and more students. The ecosystem will need to have commonalities and we will need standards to ensure these tools are interoperable across institutions,” said Overby.\nImportant recommendation to the education sector\nIf global standards are to be implemented, school owners and ministries of education must request that standards are followed by all providers of technology for educational systems, to enable information to flow easily between systems.\nStandards required by educational domains\nSeveral standards are required to better meet the needs of educational institutions. These standards should specify how the different systems within these domains share and exchange information within the domain, but also across the domains.\n“When systems within these domains have standardized their models for sharing, exchanging and governing data, we are more likely to get equal high-quality education for all,’ said Overby.\nThe four domains include:\n1) School Administrative Systems (SAS) – systems used to manage all educators, learners, their classes and subjects, as well as most administrative information governing the educational institution.\n2) Learning Management Systems (LMS) – systems used by educators to manage the work of learners, tasks they are assigned and submissions dates. The LMS also contains information about the learning paths of the individual learner and the resources they should access to meet the expected learning outcome.\n3) Digital Learning Resources (DLR) – resources accessed by learners to access the knowledge and insights required to acquire new skills and competencies. DLRs are usually designed to meet knowledge requirements as specified in different national curricula. They exist in many variants (plain text files, complex VR models).\n4) Pedagogical Learning Services (PLS) – services that guide and support educational institutions to ensure that educators reach their learning and educational goals. Some examples include learning analytics and collaborative services which support learners.\nAbout ICSD\nThe International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD) provides academia, government, civil society, UN agencies, and the private sector with the opportunity to share practical solutions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe ICSD 2020 covered diverse topics, such as education, job opportunities and clean energy transition, multilateral financing for SDGs in Africa and Asia (examples), climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction for cities, waste management and the circular economy and much more."

        "content": "A leading aerospace company has announced plans to bring a zero-emission, hydrogen-powered aircraft into service by 2035. The company said that one of the potential new designs would be able to transport 200 passengers up to two thousand miles.\nThe aviation sector has been under pressure to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. A number of governments have attached environmental conditions to coronavirus bailout packages for struggling airlines.\nResearchers have been working on electric aircraft prototypes for some time and have already tested the take-off of hydrogen fuel cell aircraft. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, a very clean form of electricity production that does not involve any generation of emissions at all, other than water vapour.\nAviation is not the only transport sector that is looking to hydrogen power to tackle carbon emissions. Hydrogen-fuelled buses have been running in cities around the world for several years and some railways in Europe have been testing hydrogen train in passenger service.  \nThe IEC has been paving the way for electric fuel cell applications through the work of IEC TC 105 on fuel cell technologies. TC 105 has developed the IEC 62282 series of standards covering safety, performance and interchangeability of fuel cell power systems.\nMost recently, it has developed IEC 62282-2-100, which provides safety related requirements for construction, operation under normal and abnormal conditions and the testing of fuel cell modules. Other key standards in the series include IEC 62282-4-102, which provides performance test methods for fuel cell power systems used in some electric trucks; and IEC 62282-5-100 on the construction, marking and test requirements for portable fuel cell power systems.\nIn 2019, IEC published a Redline version of IEC 62282-3-10. The standard applies to stationary packaged, self-contained fuel cell power systems or fuel cell power systems comprised of factory matched packages of integrated systems which generate electricity through electrochemical reactions.\nIEC Standards, together with conformity assessment, help industries to adopt more sustainable technologies. The IEC has a dedicated advisory committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) which coordinates and guides the IEC’s efforts to ensure that IEC International Standards do not include specifications which would harm the environment. \nSocial Share"

First published in 1976, this standard has been continually updated to protect against a growing number of potential hazards.\nThis standard specifically addresses the safety of household refrigerating devices and icemakers, including those used for touring caravans, camping and leisure boats. It also addresses compression-type household appliances which make use of flammable refrigerants.\nFor these devices, IEC 60335-2-24 provides protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances under normal operating conditions. It also takes into account the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.\nAccording to Gianluca Cecchinato Project Leader for the working group responsible for updating IEC 60335-2-24, “Homes around the world rely upon the safety of their refrigerating appliances and this standard allows them to do so. Important updates have been made with this revised edition, most notably regarding fire safety”.\nRevisions to the standard\nThe updated version of IEC 60335-2-24 provides several key changes.\nA number of points have been clarified, including the definition of free space, testing of accessible glass panels in the back panel (to increase the level of safety and fire protection) and the locked rotor test for fan motors. Updates have also been made to appliances using motor compressors including their measurement of input current as well as compatibility tests for their winding insulation.\nNew requirements have also been introduced for material encasing thermal insulation and for motor running capacitors.\nPublication of a Commented version\nAlongside the publication of IEC 60335-2-24, the IEC is also making available a Commented version of the standard prepared in collaboration with Dario Perroni, Secretary of IEC SC 61C.\nThe Commented version clearly identifies the differences between the previous version of the standard and the new version and also provides comments on each of the main technical changes. IEC 60335-2-24 is one of the first IEC Standards to be offered as a Commented version (CMV)."

        "content": "Did you know that the way you design test provisions to assess performance and other aspects of products can have a consequence on the use of energy and other product inputs and, as a result, have an impact on the environment? Did you know that performance and safety test provisions can have an indirect impact on the environment and, therefore, can be considered to be environmentally relevant test provisions?\nElectrical and electronic products can interact with the environment in many ways. For example, the emission of greenhouse gases or other chemical substances can pollute the air, water or land. By using certain raw materials, such as copper or silicon, products cause a depletion to Earth’s natural resources.\nEnvironmental impact can be both directly caused by the products or indirectly through the consumption of inputs such as energy. And this impact can occur throughout the lifetime of a product, from its production and usage phases to its waste phases.\nAccording to Solange Blaszkowski, who chairs the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Affairs (ACEA), “Just as protecting people from potential safety hazards from products has always been an important part of the portfolio of publications created by the IEC, so society at large is demanding that products do not damage the world in which we live”.\nMeasuring environmental impact\nTo help measure the environmental impact of products and try to minimize their adverse environmental impact, standards developers can specify test requirements. These test methods are based on known measurement principles which include repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, and cost.\nHowever, for the publication to be credible, it needs to ensure that the test methods defined are representative of how the product is used in real-life and prevent, as far as possible, a situation known as circumvention where test method provisions are misapplied in order to obtain favourable results.\nTo help standards developers define such test methods, the IEC ACEA is developing a guide to ensure the credibility of IEC publications as they relate to the environment.\nIEC Academy webinar\nAre you curious to hear how performance test provisions such as “dust removal” or “dish-washing” could have an impact on the environment and, if ill designed, lead to non-credible environmentally test provisions? Are you sure the test provisions in your standards are environmentally credible?\nJoin ACEA Chair Solange Blaszkowski and the head of the ACEA taskforce responsible for the guide on credibility, Jens Giegerich, as they explain the efforts by the IEC to ensure the credibility of its publications that address environmentally relevant test provisions.\nIn this webinar they will explore the concepts of real-life representativeness and (anti-)circumvention, in addition to the classic measurement principles of repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy, as well as cost. They will also address how the timely maintenance and updating of standards in line with technology advancements, and changes in use cases, are key to avoid ill-formulated environmental claims and to avoid the possibility for circumvention.\nThe one-hour webinar will take place on Thursday, 24 September at 9:00 and at 15:00.

        "content": "The growth of connected devices has accelerated the convergence of the once separate domains of IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology). That is why understanding the differences is the starting point for designing a cyber security strategy for industrial and critical infrastructure environments.   \nUnfortunately, cyber security is too often understood only in terms of IT, where the emphasis is on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Those responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in industrial automation and control systems (IACS). \nThe overriding priority for IACS is availability: ensuring that systems can continue to produce. The problem is that when engineers designed many of today’s industrial plants, cyber security was not a concern. OT teams were used to working within closed systems that relied heavily on physical security mechanisms to ensure integrity.\nIEC publications provide guidance to asset owners, system integrators, product suppliers, service providers, compliance authorities and other key stakeholder categories. They include two of the world’s best-known cyber security standards.\nFor IT environments, the IEC jointly develops ISO/IEC 27001 and the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards. IACS sectors rely on the IEC 62443 series for cyber protection, risk mitigation and resilience in addition to other standards.\nIEC 62443 standards are essential for industrial automation, particularly with the rapid introduction of IoT devices.\nIn the energy sector, utility grids and systems depend on IEC 62443 standards, among others, to reduce cyber risks. This applies also to nuclear power plants and a range of energy storage systems. Hydropower facilities rely also on IEC 62443.\nIn transport systems, railway networks, shipping and aviation depend also on IEC 62443 to prevent or mitigate cyber risks. International engineering companies and classification societies mention their compliance to IEC 62443 Standards as evidence of the quality of the products and services they provide.\nIEC 62443-3-2: Security Risk Assessment for System Design is an important new standard in the series. It defines a comprehensive set of engineering measures for identifying and assessing risk and applying appropriate measures for mitigation.\nIEC 62443-3-2 is based on the idea that organizations must be able to identify which of their assets are critical to achieving their stated mission. The aim is to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to protecting them.\nThis is known as a risk-based approach to cyber security.  It balances the cost of security threat mitigation against the potential impact of a successful cyber-attack.\nStandards are even more effective when combined with testing and certification, known as conformity assessment.

        "content": "Smart manufacturing covers the whole value chain and life cycle of a product, from concept, research and design to production, marketing and distribution, as well as eventual retirement and recycling. It is a technology driven approach that achieves efficiencies by integrating data from multiple technical systems across domains, hierarchies and geographic boundaries.  \nCore technologies such as digital twins — virtual replicas of physical objects and systems – rely on an efficient exchange of data between different departments, factories and even enterprises.\nRelated departments and enterprises must be able to share the latest and most accurate information about the production system and its operation. This requires a common base for describing the meaning of the data.\nCost has therefore been a major challenge, as different applications have often required custom implementations in order to make it possible for them to understand and share the same data. “Traditionally, this information has been distributed in different formats, including drawings, lists and data sheets,” explains IEC expert Thomas Hadlich.  \n“It is presented in different structures and identified differently, for example using different denominations for the same assets or for the same data points.  It means the same data must be inputted multiple times and worst of all, the latest information updated in one engineering tool is not automatically reflected in the same data in another engineering tool.”\nThe international standard IEC 62832, which is currently being updated, addresses these challenges by providing a common reference for the digitization of data related to production systems. The standard for the Digital Factory framework sets out common rules for utilizing data based on computer-understandable data attributes and classifications.\nThese annotated values facilitate the exchange of data within one production system between machines of different manufacturers or between different companies.\nThe Digital Factory framework is based on an existing standard, IEC 61360-2, which defines a common data dictionary (IEC CDD) providing classifications and metadata definitions for describing products in an unambiguous way. The original aim was to provide product data and to support procurement of electrotechnical products.\nCompanies use the definitions to provide standardized descriptions of specifications, thereby enabling interested customers to understand the characteristics of the product.  Product data based on such dictionaries provides semantically rich product descriptions.\nThe new standard applies this approach to system engineering workflows.\nThe Digital Factory framework essentially describes data in a way that makes it understandable anywhere in the world. It does this by using data dictionaries as a common base for identifying and for providing semantic information for engineering data.\nDefining the framework as an international standard makes it easier to develop interoperable engineering software and tools, as well as enabling multiple enterprises around the globe to use information collaboratively.\nWhen a company provides a component to another company the first step is to exchange information about the component. With the Digital Factory framework, they are able to provide quality data, including data for monitoring the production.\nRather than simply exchanging goods, they are providing services and information about the services.\n\nThe Digital Factory framework\n\nIEC 62832-1:2020 PRV  \n\tIndustrial-process measurement, control and automation – Digital Factory framework – Part 1: General principles\nIEC 62832-2:2020 PRV  \n\tIndustrial-process measurement, control and automation – Digital Factory framework – Part 2: Model elements\nIEC 62832-3:2020 PRV  \n\tIndustrial-process measurement, control and automation – Digital Factory framework – Part 3: Application of Digital Factory for life cycle management of production systems\n\n \nFind out more\nInternational Standardization Activity: Digital Factory Framework"

        "content": "Manufacturers must ensure that the electrical and electronic devices they produce will perform as well, whether in Singapore, South Africa or Sweden.\nIEC International Standards, published by Technical Committee 104, are the main tool suppliers can refer to to meet these essential requirements.The TC publishes two key series of standards which are widely used around the world. They are horizontal documents which apply to any electronic or electrical device.\nThe first series is the IEC 60068 set of standards which comprises around 70 publications. They specify every type of test, with the exception of some specific requirements, for instance electromagnetic compatibility, which comes under the remit of other IEC TCs, including IEC TC 77, CISPR (International Special Committee on Radio Interference) and TC 106. (For the whole list of specific requirements: TC 104 scope)\n“Our work inside TC 104 concerns two very broad categories of tests. One of them is dynamic testing, meaning the ability of items to withstand shocks and vibrations. The other category is climatic testing, which relates to temperature and humidity levels and other problems like fungus or mould. Then we have a few cases that do not fit into either group, for example the abrasion of markings and letterings caused by repetitive finger rubbing. This is an important test, specified in IEC 60068-2-70, and which is useful for any keypad or touch screen, whether on a mobile phone or a cash machine, for instance. There have been quite a few instances where finger markings on cash machines or access control systems were so pronounced that it would become easy to use people’s pins and get into their bank accounts or gain access to prohibited areas. Manufacturers need to make sure their equipment withstands that type of abrasion over time,” Chair of TC 104 Olaf Hübschmann describes.\nNew standards published in February\nIn February, the IEC released the whole series of IEC 60068-2 Standards, covering tests for cold which determine the ability of components, equipment or other articles to be used, transported or stored at low temperature (IEC 60068-2-1), dry heat (IEC 60068-2-2), vibration (IEC 60068-2-6)  or even mould growth (IEC 60068-2-10). “These standards tell test labs and manufacturers how to perform tests, in a repeatable and comparable way across the world,” says Hübschmann.\nThe TC also publishes the IEC 60721 series, another large collection of publications, which classifies the various environmental conditions which require testing. “Manufacturers will often use both series of standards. They want to qualify their equipment to work in different environmental conditions all over the world. If you manufacture an item that is destined for Central Europe, you will need to keep abreast of the requirements for that part of the world. You will need to know the climate conditions in Sudan or South Africa and how that can affect performance and life of products. You will also need to find out how different types of transport affect equipment and so on. All that information can be found in the IEC 60721 Standards,” Hübschmann explains.\nFor more on IEC TC 104 Standards, read e-tech."

        "content": "This storage capability makes it an ideal stabilizing energy, which can compensate for the fluctuating nature of other forms of renewables, originating from the sun or the wind. Underground thermal energy storage systems store energy by pumping heat into an underground space. Thermal energy can be stored in boreholes, aquifers and caverns or pits. The storage medium is water but can also be molten salts, soil and rocks. Boreholes are man-made vertical heat exchangers that work to transfer heat between the energy carrier and the ground layers.\nGeothermal energy resources differ from one geographic location to another, depending on depth, temperature and pressure, abundance of ground water and underground chemical composition.\nState of play\nAs highlighted in the most recent REN 21 report, Turkey and Indonesia remained in the lead for new geothermal installations in 2019, followed closely by Kenya. Other countries that added new geothermal power plants in 2019 (or added capacity at existing facilities) were Costa Rica, Japan, Mexico, the United States and Germany.\nThe top 10 countries with the largest stock of geothermal power capacity at the end of 2019 were the United States, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, New Zealand, Mexico, Kenya, Italy, Iceland and Japan. Several amongst them see geothermal electrical energy as one of the ways to meet their renewable energies target, in an attempt to align with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. For instance, the Indonesian government’s target for 23% renewables in the energy mix by 2025 assumes an installed geothermal power capacity of 7 GW (7% of the energy mix).\nIEC Standard for steam turbines\nFor the geothermal industry to continue expanding everywhere around the world, the technology used must meet proper safety and performance benchmarks. IEC International Standards ensure that systems and devices employed are tested and meet the appropriate standards of quality and efficiency. IEC Technical Committee 5 develops specifications and standards for the rating and testing of steam turbines. In 2020, it released the second edition of a key standard specifying the requirements for steam turbines: IEC 60045-1, which now includes automation safety specifications. The standard can be used for geothermal steam turbines but also for turbines employed in concentrated solar power plants, another form of renewable energy.\nRead more about geothermal energy in e-tech."

Known as the 60335 series, it is comprised of two parts, with the first part consisting of the general safety requirements for all appliances while the second part addresses the requirements for specific device types.\nAs the number of these household appliances multiplies and their complexity increases, the IEC has regularly updated the general safety requirements: IEC 60335-1, Household and similar electrical appliances – Safety – Part I: General Requirements. It has now published the latest updates in its sixth edition of the standard.\nThis standard provides protection against many types of hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation when appliances are used under normal conditions. It also considers how electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.\nAccording to Randi Myers, the Project Leader who managed the updates to the latest edition of IEC 60335-1, “household appliance safety plays a big role for society considering the impact these products have on the day-to-day life of consumers and their dispersal across society”.\nAddressing a ‘smart’ environment\nConnecting household appliances to the internet is a growing trend. Devices can be controlled remotely and even programmed to remember preferences and provide guidance. Despite the novelty and convenience of these new features that require a connection to the internet, they also generate new safety risks. As Myers notes, “Security, in particular security in transactions over the external public network and the web, are of a great concern”.\nIEC 60335-1 has been updated to include cyber security requirements in order to avoid unauthorized access and mitigate the effects of transmission failures via remote communication through public networks.\nUpdating battery requirements\nHousehold appliances are increasingly powered by batteries. To ensure the safety of these products and reduce fire hazards, IEC 60335-1 has been updated with new requirements for battery-operated appliances that are non-rechargeable as well as appliances that use lithium-ion batteries.\nPublication of a Commented version\nAlongside the publication of IEC 60335-1, the IEC is also making available a Commented version of the standard.\nThe Commented version clearly identifies the differences between the previous version of the standard and the new version and also provides comments on each of the main technical changes. IEC 60335-1 is one of the first IEC Standards to be offered as a Commented version (CMV).\nA longer version of this article is available on e-tech."

We publish a few extracts of his full interview which can be read in e-tech. (For more on his background you can refer to Making plans for hydro).\nYou became Chair of IEC TC 4 at a difficult time, during the Covid-19 pandemic. What are the main challenges for the hydro sector?\nGlobally, the situation is difficult both for manufacturers and utilities. Because of confinement, people have consumed less. The economy is slowing down as well. This has already affected energy consumption. The hydro sector will have to make savings like all the other energy sectors, while striving to remain the biggest source of renewable energy in the world. It is quite a tall order. Hydro electrical energy, while less expensive to produce than nuclear power, must compete with other sources of renewable energy which can be cheaper, especially for newly installed capacity. But it has the huge advantage of being one of the only renewable energies that can provide long-term and substantial levels of energy storage. It makes sense to combine hydro with other sources of renewable energy which are fluctuating like wind and solar.\nWhat new technologies are likely to impact hydro power?\nAutomation is becoming increasingly important, together with the use of control commands and control command software. Increased automation raises issues relating to cyber security. In TC 4, the first step will be to adapt cyber security standards produced by other IEC TCs. We are not planning to reinvent the wheel. Different countries have their own cyber security standards as well, some of which are state of the art. I learned from my eight-year experience in Israel, where I worked on a project to help build a hydro plant, that the country’s cyber security standards are very strict.\nIt is also important to bring facilities that have been around for decades up to date, by replacing parts using the latest technologies: turbines have evolved a lot over recent years and can be adapted to different water flows and function at variable speeds, for instance. Climate change and environmental degradation have resulted in a reduction of water inflow at some hydropower plants, as well as a decrease in reservoir levels. Some hydropower plants suffer from water head reduction, together with a decrease in efficiency of energy conversion in hydro turbines. Variable speed turbines can be a more energy efficient solution. Sensors and micro-processors perform better every year thanks to technology innovations. The aim is to improve the performance of installed facilities and make them more efficient.\nWhat will be your priorities as Chair?\nMy absolute priority will be to ensure that there is balance between manufacturers and utilities inside TC 4, so that each side understands the other and that we can reach compromises. One of my tasks will also be to recruit new experts, notably for one of our working groups which prepares standards for small hydro facilities. This is an expanding area: in France, around 50% of the hydro installations are small facilities and the standards required are quite different from the ones developed for big hydro plants. But not enough experts want to be involved."

They must determine the likelihood of a patient being exposed to various hazards and hazardous situations through a formal risk assessment process.\nStandards enable manufacturers to achieve this because they consider safety, performance, environmental and other aspects for the equipment’s entire lifecycle. In particular, the IEC 60601 series identifies many of those hazards and hazardous situations and provides generally accepted methods for controlling the risk to the operator and patient.\nRead the full interview in e-tech magazine with expert Charles Sidebottom, who has been involved in the work of TC 62 for over 30 years, and find out more about the key changes in the standards."

        "content": "New analysis of refuse left outside the city walls of Pompeii suggests that the ancient Romans may have invented recycling. Archaeologists believe that the Romans regularly sorted and reused materials such as broken tiles, amphorae and lumps of mortar and plaster.\nTwo thousand years later, the modern world produces over two billion tonnes of municipal solid waste every year. According to a report by Verisk Maplecroft, that is enough to fill over 800,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.\nThe report says that only 16% (323 million tonnes) of this is recycled each year. A staggering 46% (950 million tonnes) is disposed of unsustainably.\nExperts blame this phenomenon on our linear economic model, where products are made, used and discarded. When electrical items break down, for instance, consumers buy replacements, all too often because the devices are impossible or too costly to repair.  \nFortunately, a new economic model re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption. It calls for a paradigm shift across society in which products, components and materials are viewed as regenerative and restorative.\nThe notion of a circular economy is gaining traction not only among environmentalists and academics but also within governmental and business sectors.\nTo make products that last longer, standards are needed to ensure that product safety, performance and reliability are sufficiently taken into account. Issues such as data removal and security must also be considered as products are reused and change ownership.\nMoreover, a holistic approach is needed to ensure that the protection of the environment is not detrimental to areas such as product safety, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and performance.\nLegislation is expected to require the increased use of used parts as well as products that can more easily be repaired or remanufactured. Standardized methods and tools will be needed to assess aspects such as the proportion of reused components or recycled content in a product, and how to assess the ease (or difficulty) with which a product can be repaired or remanufactured.\nStandards are needed to guarantee the properties of the used material, as well as to define the requirements for parts reliability. Within the IEC, several committees have developed standards that support material efficiency for electrical and electronic products.\nSome examples include:\n\nIEC TR 62635 with information on product end of life, including the recyclability rate calculation.\nIEC TR 62824 with guidance about material efficiency considerations in the eco-design of products.\nIEC 62309 which examines the dependability of products containing used parts.\nIEC 63077 which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment.\n\nNew standards covering requirements for material efficiency in the design of products, such as circular ready design, are needed and plans are underway to start such standardization work in the IEC.\nThe circular economy is more advanced than recycling. It calls for a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived.\nThe circular economy affects the entire lifecycle of a product, from initial design and the materials employed to the use of the product, its repair, reuse and the transformation of its parts into a new product. For the time being, though, it seems there is still a lot we can learn about sustainability from the ancient Romans."

Some allege that pig is an acronym for ‘pipeline inspection gauge’ or ‘pipeline intervention gadget’; others affirm that the original pigs, made of straw wrapped in wire, and used for cleaning, made a noise similar to the squealing of a pig when traveling through the pipe.\nThere are several types of pigs, from the foam pig, driven through the line to measure its inner diameter, clean it or dry it, to the inline inspection pigs, including smart pigs, that can check various aspects of the pipeline.\nModern smart pigs are highly sophisticated instruments that include electronics and sensors that collect various forms of data during their trip through the pipeline. They vary in technology and complexity depending on their intended use.\nThe electronics elements within the pig are sealed to prevent leakage of the pipeline fluid, which range from highly basic to highly acidic and can be of extremely high pressure and temperature. Power for the electronics is typically provided by onboard batteries which are also sealed.\nProtection requirements\nAs many of these pigs are used in oil or gas pipelines, it is of the utmost importance that they are designed and built in compliance with the very strict requirements enunciated in standards and specifications, most notably in IEC International Standards developed by IEC Technical Committee 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres.\nAs part of its IEC 60079 series of international standards on explosive atmospheres, TC 31 has developed several international standards that cover general and testing requirements for several types of pigs, including magnetic or ultrasonic pig signallers, pig tracking systems and pig intelligent systems.\nAs is the case for any product, designing and building pigs in compliance with IEC International Standards is not enough. To prove that a pig meets all the requirements spelled out in standards and can be used in explosive (Ex) areas, it has to go through testing and certification.\nThis is where IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres, intervenes. An IECEx certificate provides clear proof of claimed compliance with international standards andt certifies that the equipment in question has the right level of protection.\nRead more about pipeline pigging in the latest edition of e-tech."

        "content": "No organization, however big or small, is immune from cyber risk. The social media giant, Twitter, is the latest household name to suffer a security breach, but a growing number of attacks against small and medium-sized businesses goes unreported.\nThe Twitter attack used ‘social engineering’ techniques to trick employees into giving them access to account support tools. The term social engineering describes the use of psychological manipulation to con individuals into performing actions that enable hackers to infect systems and networks with malicious code.\nAccording to Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report nearly 90% of malware is delivered in emails, in what are known as phishing campaigns. It is believed that the Twitter employees were victim to a vishing attack, which substitutes e-mail for a direct phone call.  \nIn the following video clip, which has been viewed more than three million times, a security consultant demonstrates just how easy it can be to gain access to an employee’s computer over the phone.\nIn the following video clip, which has been viewed more than three million times, a security consultant demonstrates just how easy it can be to gain access to an employee’s computer over the phone.\n\n\n\nVishing is a form of attack that uses voice calls to trick victims into disclosing sensitive information or performing an action that compromises corporate security.\nAlthough news coverage tends to focus on data breaches in major corporations, cyber attacks against organizations of all sizes have grown dramatically in recent years. The increasing numbers of people working from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the situation.\nEmployees are the common factor linking many of the security breaches, which sometimes are deliberately malicious, but more often are down to carelessness. “People going about their normal operational duties are the biggest threat,” says IEC cyber security expert Frances Cleveland. \nThat is why the information management security system (ISMS) requirements described in ISO/IEC 27001 defines a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology.  Using ISO/IEC 27001, helps organizations to manage all their information security risks.\nThese include threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad” — and for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nThe IEC advocates a holistic approach to cyber security, combining best practices with testing and certification, is the best way to build cyber resilience. ISO/IEC 27001 is part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications.\nIECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met."

Alongside this demand, the market is benefiting from improvements to fibre optic technologies.\nThe IEC has published a new standard for the testing of fibre optic cabling. IEC 61280-4-5 provides test methods to measure the attenuation of installed multimode and single-mode optical fibre cabling plant as well as the determination of their polarity and length. This standard is applicable to optical fibre cabling plants that terminate with multi-fibre push-on (MPO) connectors and use test equipment having an MPO interface.\nAccording to Seymour Goldstein, Project Leader for IEC 61280-4-5 “This publication substantially increases the accuracy in assessing maximal data transmission capacity of new and existing fibre optic networks. Uncertainties in the transmission link loss in fibre optic cabling is reduced which is important information for engineers involved in the network design and field deployment of fibre optic networks”.\nIEC 61280-4-5 designates the following five test methods:\n• one-cord method\n• three-cord method\n• adapter-cord method\n• equipment cord method\n• optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) method\nThe first four methods use an optical light source and power meter (LSPM) to measure input and output power levels of the cabling to determine the attenuation and cabling polarity. The OTDR method emits short light impulses into the cabling and measures the backscattered power as a function of propagation time delay or length along the optical fibre.\nIEC 61280-4-5 is part of the IEC 61280 series of standards which provides testing procedures for fibre optic communication subsystems."

IBM recently estimated the average cost of a data breach at nearly four million US dollars.\nA new international standard, ISO/IEC 27701:2019, provides organizations with the clear guidance they need to mitigate personal information risk to a minimum. It takes into account not only national laws and regulations, but also the environment in which organizations operate.\nThe new standard is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, which many organizations have already used to implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS). While ISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to take their environment into consideration, the new standard goes a step further by mapping to the privacy framework and principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100.\nISO/IEC 27701 shows organizations how to manage and process data to reduce risk and demonstrate compliance with updated and more stringent privacy regulations around the world. It specifies requirements and provides guidance for implementing, maintaining and continually improving a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) capable of ensuring effective management of personal data within an organization.\nThe new document outlines a framework for any data that could potentially identify a specific individual, known as personally identifiable information (PII). It provides guidance for PII controllers and PII processors.\nIt is relevant and applicable to anyone with responsibility and accountability for managing PII. This covers all types and sizes of organizations, including public and private companies, government entities and not-for-profit organizations.\nISO/IEC 27701 generates documented evidence of how organizations handle the processing of personal information, including clearer definitions of roles and responsibilities. It delivers a number of additional benefits, including transparency between stakeholders and increased trust, as well as facilitating agreements with business partners.\nDr Andreas Wolf, Chair of the joint ISO/IEC technical committee that developed the standard, said almost every organization processes personally identifiable information (PII), and protecting it is not only a legal requirement but a societal need.\n“ISO/IEC 27701 defines processes and provides guidance for protecting PII on an ongoing, ever evolving basis. Because being a management system, it defines processes for continuous improvement on data protection, particularly important in a world where technology doesn’t stand still.”\nWhen implemented together with the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, ISO/IEC 27701 gives clients confidence in the reliability of the systems to which they have entrusted their data. This can play a crucial role in helping to protect brand reputations.\nAgainst a backdrop of sweeping regulatory change, it provides tools for implementing robust data security management systems that deal with sensitive information efficiently and effectively.

They are used to isolate, control and protect electrical equipment.\nIn an industrial setting, they help protect electric motors from surges and short circuit that could cause damage as well as to provide basic control functions such as start/stop and acceleration.\nThe IEC 60947 series of standards is widely used around the world to ensure the safety and performance of low voltage control gear and switchgear. Within this series, the IEC has published a new edition of its IEC 60947-5-8 standard which specifies the requirements for “three position enabling switches” prepared by IEC SC121A..\nThese three-position enabling switches are components for enabling devices used to produce a machine operation permission signal as follows:\n\nWhen activated, allows machine operation to be initiated by a separate start control\n\n\nWhen de-activated, it can initiate a stop function, and,\n\n\nWhen de-activated, prevents the initiation of machine operation.\n\n \nAccording to Ikuo Maeda from IDEC Corporation in Japan, who served as the Project Leader for IEC 60947-5-8, “This standard ensures the safe operation of machinery. If a worker encounters a dangerous situation during the operation of machinery, the operator’s panic action – an unconscious reaction to either ‘release the hand’ or ‘grip firmly’ – cancels the operation permission of the machine and immediately stops the machine. This contributes to the safety of the machine operators”.\n\nMr Maeda continued, “The safety improvements resulting from the unconscious reaction of the operator can be applied to industrial robots as well as to machines with manual operation”.\n\nCompared with the previous edition, the new edition of IEC 60947-5-8 includes a revised scope, operational characteristics and tests given the increasing range of applications for three-position enabling switches. The new edition also incudes a new annex with a procedure to determine the reliability of data when used in functional safety applications.\nAs part of the IEC 60947 series, the IEC published an updated version of IEC 60947-1, a foundational standard for industrial switches and controlgear, earlier in the year."

        "content": "According to the International Energy Agency (IAE), energy efficiency is the ‘first fuel of a sustainable, global energy system’. Yet it is often overlooked. How can this resource be better harvested?\nTo help technical committees consider issues related to energy efficiency when developing standards for electrical and electronic devices and systems, the IEC set up the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) in 2013.\nDefining energy efficiency\nThe IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy. It consists of the following: using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for better performance, or improving the conversion of energy into electricity.\nEconomic growth implies an increased demand in energy. However, this demand in energy can have negative consequences for the environment. For this reason, energy efficiency is a cost-effective means for supporting the growing demand for energy while simultaneously limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\nBarriers to energy efficiency\nMany energy efficient technologies and solutions are readily available. Investments and a commitment towards energy efficiency abound, yet a number of barriers inhibits the deployment of energy efficiency solutions and impedes harvesting the full potential of energy efficiency.\nThe barriers to the wide adoption of energy efficiency include a lack of awareness about the saving potential, focus on the performance of devices rather than the system, and the absence of incentives for the user. The lack of adequate information about performance efficiency as well as the lack of widely used metrics to measure performance efficiency is another barrier.\nHowever, standardization can offer solutions to help overcome these barriers.\nStandards can help\nStandardization can play an important role for energy efficiency. For example, standards provide definitions and measurements of performance, help to disseminate and promote energy efficiency technologies and set minimum energy performance requirements.\nYet the challenge for standardization is to provide a systems integration approach. While improving the energy efficiency of individual devices can lead to better energy outcomes, a systems integration approach allows much greater benefit.\nACEE has developed Guide 118 and Guide 119 which enable technical committees to harmonize the energy efficiency standardization and adopt a systems approach."

An overwhelming 96% of respondents believed that standards would be “extremely important” or “important” in the future.\n“The current COVID-19 crisis has shown this to be more evident than ever,” commented Wilkins.  “I have attended many webinars and meetings over the past few months where standards were front and centre in the risk evaluation process, the management process, and now the return to work and recovery process.”\nThe IEC has identified a number of benefits that international standards and conformity assessment provide. These include ensuring the safety, performance and reliability of electronic and electrical systems and devices, as well as facilitating trade and access to new markets.\nIn addition, standards provide the technical frameworks, metrics and specifications that regulators can reference in legislation. Standards also provide governments with technical references in public tenders, lending confidence that products meet commonly agreed rules that have been developed and accepted by industry and regulators.\nFurthermore, the use of IEC Standards and the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems help developing countries ensure that products entering their market fulfil required safety and performance criteria.

        "content": "Off-grid renewable energy solutions have become a critical component in helping homes access electricity and achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nLighting Global, set up by the World Bank Group, is one organization that is working to bring sustainable and affordable electricity to homes using off-grid renewable energy. As part of its efforts, Lighting Global established its Quality Assurance Framework and Quality Standards to ensure that products met minimum performance and safety requirements. In June, the Lighting Global Quality Standards became an official IEC Technical Specification known as IEC TS 62257-9-8.\nA new IEC Technical Specification for off-grid energy access\nIEC TS 62257-9-8 sets the baseline requirements for the quality, durability and advertising accuracy for stand-alone renewable energy products with the aim of protecting consumers. The evaluation of these requirements is based on the test methods defined in IEC TS 62257-9-5. Both of these publications are part of the IEC 62257 series which focus on rural electrification.\nFollowing the maturation of the off-grid pico-solar market and in response to requests from national governments, Lighting Global submitted its Quality Standards to the IEC for standardization. IEC TS 62257-9-8 is expected to become the foundational standard for this market.\nArne Jacobson, Technical Lead for Lighting Global Quality Assurance, helped to shepherd the Lighting Global Quality Standards through the IEC standardization process as co-chair for the joint working group for off-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems within the IEC.\nHe notes that “Adoption and publication of IEC 62257-9-8 will enable even more widespread implementation of these standards by national governments, development agencies, and the private sector, thereby contributing to a harmonized approach to quality assurance, safety, and consumer protection for this growing and dynamic sector”.\nJacobson continued, adding, “Because governments are familiar with the IEC, the adoption of the standards can enable more widespread and homogenized adoption of standards by many countries because governments trust IEC standards.”\nBoosting an emerging market\nBecause the market for off-grid, renewable energy products is embryonic, international standards can provide a catalyst for building trust between manufacturers, consumers, and governments. They bring credibility to the technologies while also protecting consumers. Manufacturers benefit from harmonized regulations and a reduction in barriers to trade that allow them to enter new markets.\nGreenlight Planet, one of the leading companies in the off-grid solar sector and its products have powered over five million homes.  According to its CEO and founder T. Patrick Walsh, “Internationally-recognized quality standards have been critical to the development of the off-grid solar sector over the past decade, allowing governments and end consumers alike to understand and trust this transformative new model for energy access”.\nAccording to the Lighting Global Market Trends Report, the potential market for off-grid products remains strong. In the past ten years, the industry has become a USD 1,75 billion annual market serving 420 million people. And between 2017 and 2019, revenues grew 30 percent annually."

        "content": "IEC, ISO and ITU experts are evaluating the use of standards to address the growing emergence of ‘fake’ media. Unlike the murky world of fake news, the intentions behind fake media can be either good or bad.\nThe term ‘fake’ can be applied to any manipulated media. The entertainment industry benefits enormously from new technologies to create realistic special effects or artificial natural scene production with actors in the studio.\nThere is even an Oscar for the best visual effects. It is the same with news: leading public service broadcasters use virtual studios for their news bulletins, where the set is either computer-generated or a video image.  \nThe problem is that the same technologies can be used for the purposes of disinformation and fake news. Computer-generated clips that are designed to look real, known as deepfakes, not only distort reality, but could also destroy the reputations of their victims.\nAccording to MIT Technology Review, deepfakes are “a perfect weapon for purveyors of fake news who want to influence everything from stock prices to elections.”\nRecent advances in media manipulation are making it increasingly difficult to know what can and cannot be believed. Technologies like deep learning, for example, can be used to produce near realistic media content that to the human eye is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  \nThe JPEG working group is concerned that the misuse of manipulated media can cause social unrest, spread rumours for political gain or encourage hate crimes. They are actively supporting efforts to increase transparency about the types of manipulation performed.\nThe challenge is that when the purpose is fake news, the authors of the manipulated footage keep that hidden. That is why social media companies and news outlets have been developing mechanisms to detect and flag the offending content.\nIn addition, some governments are planning legislation. The JPEG working group believes it can best support the various efforts is by developing a JPEG standard that facilitates a secure and reliable way of flagging fake media, whether created in good faith or with malicious intentions.\nThe first step, though, will be to carry out an in-depth analysis of the entire fake media ecosystem in order to identifying the potential role of standardization.\nMore information on the initiative is available on the JPEG website. The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is responsible for the popular JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPSearch, JPEG XT and more recently, the JPEG XS, JPEG Systems, JPEG Pleno and JPEG XL families of imaging standards.\nRead the JPEG media release"

        "content": "The IEC and ISO have set up a working group (WG 14) in their joint technical committee (JTC1) to identify the standardization needs of quantum computing.\nIt is hoped that their work can support the evolution of quantum computing by providing a foundation of already defined systems and processes. Such a foundation would enable developers to focus their attention on the higher-level challenges, rather than starting their projects from scratch.\ne-tech spoke to Hong Yang, who is the director of the Network Technology Research Department of the China Electronics and Standardization Institute (CESI). She also chairs WG 14.\ne-tech: What are the main goals of WG14?\nHY: First of all WG 14 should fulfill the terms of reference which is approved inside JTC 1, to act as a system integration entity inside JTC 1，to maintain relations with other organizations, whether within JTC 1 or not, and to identify gaps and opportunities in the field of  quantum computing standardization. \nWG 14 is also keen to provide a worldwide collaboration platform for the quantum computing industry, including academic organizations and high-tech institutes, as well as companies. \n e-tech: What are your other goals?\nHY: To get more demands or requirements for quantum computing. We hope to push the growing consensus of opinion on quantum computing from all over the world. Essentially, in WG 14 we are trying to promote the development of industrialization.\ne-tech: Quantum computing is still in its infancy as a technology. Why are you taking this step now?\nHY: Quantum computing industry is truly in its early stage. Companies are working on the exploratory stage of quantum computer. Quantum bits are still difficult to control and keep stable. In terms of software or algorithms, both universities and academic organizations have been working on this for many years.\nRegarding standardization, after a period of research inside ISO/IEC JTC 1, experts believe that it is necessary and possible to have a unified understanding of the terminology and vocabulary for the future of this emerging technology. From my personal perspective, I believe this is in accordance with IEC Master Plan, which states that “The IEC will strengthen its capacity to identify and respond to emerging (and potentially disruptive) technology developments, as well as to market and social trends ”.\ne-tech: How long is it likely to take before we see the first international standards for quantum computing?\nHY: The new work item proposal, named “Information technology-Quantum computing-terminology and vocabulary”, is registered for 24 months, so probably two years later, in 2022, the international standard will be published. We are looking forward to seeing that.\n \nRead the full story in e-tech"

Very much the focus of the last few International Broadcasting Conventions (IBCs) in Amsterdam, the technology enables to significantly improve luminosity range, working in 4k and 8k video formats.\nAccording to a well-known graphics processor company in the field, “with HDR bright things can be really bright, dark things can be really dark, and details can be seen in both.”\nISO/IEC 23090-3, also known as H.266 in the ITU-T, is the latest in a series of very successful standards for video coding that have been jointly developed with ITU-T, and is the direct successor to the well-known and widely used High Efficiency Video Coding – HVEC – (ISO/IEC 23008-2/ ITU-T H.265) and Advanced Video Coding – AVC – (ISO/IEC 14496-10/ITU-T H.264 |) standards.\nThis most recently published Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard advances the state of the art of video compression and has unprecedented application versatility. In addition to specifying the encoding for HDR and high resolution video, it has the flexibility to enable emerging applications such as 360-degree omnidirectional immersive multimedia, remote screen sharing, cloud-based collaboration, cloud gaming, and region-based extraction and merging.\nEmmy Awards\nThe HVEC standard was honoured with a Primetime Emmy Award in 2017 in recognition of its emergence as the primary coding format for Ultra High Definition (UHD) TV services. The standard became the key enabling technology for UHD viewing while concurrently enabling operators to utilize network capacity more efficiently.\nThe AVC standard was also granted with a Primetime Emmy Award in 2008 for unlocking significant advances in video spanning from high definition TV (HDTV) to 3G mobile multimedia. The standard enabled improvements in video quality that facilitated the deployment of HDTV services. It remains the world’s most widely deployed video compression standard.  \nThe bets are on : will the VVC Standard obtain an Emmy Award? Judging by its predecessors, it could be a serious contender."

        "content": "Walter Jager will be presenting the new edition of the IEC 62474 Standard during a session devoted to declarations for EU Substance of Concern in Articles (SCIP) database reporting.\nIEC TC 111 prepares horizontal environmental standards for electrical and electronic devices, including on materials declaration, environmentally-conscious design and toxic substance testing and control.\nManufacturers and suppliers of electrical and electronic goods need to know how to report the different materials and substances in their products so as to conform to the various pieces of legislation on these topics and sometimes even anticipate them. The new edition of IEC 62443 is a very complete standard which provides information on what substances to report and how to report them, including a separate mechanism for the exchange of data down the supply chain.\nA common format is used to ease the transfer and processing of data. The standard also comes with a validated open database which includes a declarable substance list (DSL), which is updated in line with regulatory requirements. The new edition enables users to employ two different methods for declaring substances.\n “The standard defines a declaration for compliance and a composition declaration. The first one enables suppliers to check their products against the existing DSL, whereas the second allows them to make a broader substance declaration, which includes, at a minimum, any declarable substances in the product. The composition declaration can optionally include other substances as well, and can even become a complete substance declaration. In the previous edition, the two different types of declaration were merged into one, with no clearly defined rules for substance reporting. This new approach makes things easier for both manufacturers and suppliers,” explains Walter Jager.\nThe IEC 62474 DSL is regularly updated, as new or revised regulations are released. “It is brought up to date by three different groups dealing with separate geographical areas: Americas, Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). These groups keep track of the various regulatory changes around the world,” says Christophe Garnier, chair of IEC TC 111. A typical example of such regulations is the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, which restricts the use of specific hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products.\nThe standard is initially aimed at the electronics and electrical industries but can be used by any supply sector wishing to report chemical substances in their products. “The toy or the textile industry, to mention just a couple, could use the standard to meet their own requirements. It is easy to adapt it, all you need to do is establish the relevant list of substances in your product, using the IEC 62474 declaration methods and employ the exchange format for the transfer of data down the supply chain. The list of exemptions can also be customized,” Garnier adds.\nThe Electronics goes green conference was a three day event which took place last year in Berlin, Germany, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic it has mutated to a one day online conference.\nFind out more about TC 111 on https://tc111.iec.ch/"

        "content": "Over 320 participants joined the recent IEC Academy workshop on smart cities. Organized by IEC SyC Smart cities, the workshop brought together eight speakers who shared their expertise about the new technologies that are shaping smart cities.\nMichael Mulquin, Chair of SyC Smart cities, provided an overview of the current work of the IEC in the development of smart city standards. As he noted, cities depend on standards for much of their infrastructure. The IEC has identified over 1800 standards which are essential to the proper functioning of a city.\nHowever, as Mulquin notes, “we need to understand the whole system and how the different parts fit into the system as a whole”. As part of its systems approach to smart cities, the IEC is developing a Smart City Reference Architecture, including case-studies, as well as common terminology that can ensure a common understanding of various terms.\nIn order to understand how countries are approaching smart city solutions, Kyoung-Sook Kim from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) provided an overview of the development of a smart city reference architecture in Japan. This approach calls for a common architecture that can be applied across systems and cities with the aim of achieving ‘society 5.0’, which is defined as a “human-centred society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social issues using a system that integrates the physical and cyber worlds”.\nThe government has recently published a white paper about the smart city reference architecture which will soon be available in English.\nIn his presentation on the use of digital twins for smart cities, Bart De Lathouwer from OGC discussed how the combination of 3D city models with the dynamic data gathered using sensors can help us better understand our cities and how we want them to develop.\nThis information is applicable for both indoors and outdoors, above and below ground. In Rotterdam, city planners could use 3D models with available data to better understand the implication of constructing buildings higher than the current maximum building height. However, as De Lathouwer noted, challenges exist and will “require that the standards community come together”.\nEric Simon from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provided an overview of the underlying concepts supporting smart cities. He highlighted the many definitions that exist for terms such as smart cities and many of the technologies used. He discussed the importance of IoT, which is “at the core of smart cities”, distributed computing, artificial intelligence and the residents of cities and how they participate within the system.\nSeveral speakers discussed specific technologies that can help promote interoperability and scalability. This included OASC Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs), Context Information Modelling from FIWARE and TM Forum Open APIs.\nIn a final presentation, Alexander Samarin from IEC SyC Smart cities discussed the IEC systems approach to building smart cities which enables to successfully manage complexity.\nPresentations will be made available on the IEC Academy website."

        "content": "The ship classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, also known as ClassNK, is advising the ship building industry to incorporate the IEC 62443 series into their cyber security strategies. As the operational technologies on ships grow increasingly sophisticated, they are also becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks.\nNowadays, malware regularly hits operational environments, including those in the maritime sector. For example, the 2017 NotPetya malware attack crippled ports, terminals and cargo handling operations.\nSince then ransomware attacks have targeted ports and shipping companies. Seanews reports that cyber attacks on the maritime industry’s operational technology (OT) systems have increased by 900% over the last three years.\nLike many other industries, shipping is increasingly dependent on digitalization. With the convergence of OT and information technology (IT), modern shipboard systems, such as those used for navigation, monitoring engines and cargo management, are connected to shore-based infrastructure.\nFrom a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that unlike business systems, IACS are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks.\nThat is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk. Where IT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called “C-I-A triad” — in the world of OT, availability is of foremost importance. Priorities for OT environments focus on health and safety and protecting the environment.\nIn the event of an emergency in order to be able to protect personnel or to minimize the impacts of natural disasters, it is therefore vital that operators can receive accurate and timely information and can quickly take appropriate actions, such as shutting off power or shifting to backup equipment.\nA key challenge, according to a recent IEC Technology Report, is that cyber security is too often understood only in terms of IT (information technology). Those responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints. \nIEC 62443, is designed to keep OT systems running. It can be applied to any ICS environment\nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nClassNK describes its new guidelines as “a compilation of current best practices for newbuilding designs by shipyards and shipbuilding owners from the perspective of identifying computer systems that should be protected from cyber incidents and of building networks to protect them”. You can download Guidelines for Designing Cyber Security Onboard Ships here.\nClassNK is a not-for-profit non-governmental organization dedicated to ensuring the safety of life and property at sea, and the prevention of pollution of the marine environment."

        "abstract": "Covid-19 has accelerated the digital transformation already underway by many manufacturers. IEC YP Leader Shuo Wang discusses the importance of standardization for smart manufacturing.",
        "content": "Digital transformation is “the profound transformation of business and organizational activities, processes, competencies and models to fully leverage the changes and opportunities of a mix of digital technologies and their accelerating impact across society in a strategic and prioritized way, with present and future shifts in mind”, as adopted by IEC Strategic Group 12 on Digital transformation.\nGlobal manufacturing has been greatly impacted from the breakout of the COVID 19 pandemic. Some manufacturers have even been confronted with a crisis of survival. The pandemic forced traditional manufacturing to change its developing vision from “passive transformation” to “active transformation”. The manufacturers that have a stronger base began to seek digital breakthrough proactively. They took the pandemic as a “proving ground” for new technologies and a “training ground” for new business models.\nWork resumption can be rapidly achieved by means of remote collaboration, e-business, robot factory, etc. Increasingly, manufacturers directly perceived the outstanding superiority of digital transformation. They further considered “what to transfer” and “how to transfer”.\nDigital transformation promotes the transformation of the core value of manufacturing from “quality and efficiency” to “interconnection and interoperation”. It helps manufacturing break through the data chain of overall factors, links and processes, and also propels the interconnection between product and service, hardware and software, application and platform. It facilitates the cross-border integration of different industry chains, and ultimately  creates an ecosphere of information interaction, resource sharing, capability synergy and open collaboration.\nPrior to the pandemic, with the continuous evolution of a new round of scientific revolution and industrial transformation, many countries, consortia, and also standards organizations launched their strategies related to digital transformation in manufacturing. Standardization was invariably included in their priority action plans, moreover, with the slogan of “standards go first”. These initiatives may have had diverse names, but no matter whether it is Smart Manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Advanced Manufacturing or Lean Manufacturing, the core value behind them is “interconnection and interoperation”. Standardization, with its innate attribute of “consensus”, plays an essential role of guiding, regulating and guaranteeing the healthy and orderly development of digital transform in manufacturing.\nDuring the 2019 Qingdao Forum on International Standardization, former IEC General Secretary, Frans Vreeswijk gave an address which highlighted the important contribution that standardization makes to digitalization and the 4th industrial revolution – allowing systems of different manufacturers to interconnect and interoperate without the need for special integration efforts.\nIEC SyC Smart manufacturing, IEC TC 65 on Industrial-process measurement, control and automation, ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 on Information technology and many other related IEC committees have already published more than 400 international standards and reports to support digital transformation in manufacturing, including the key technologies of reference architecture, semantics, communication, integration, safety and security, smart products/devices, digital factory, intelligent service, etc.\nMeanwhile, standardization itself is pushed forward by the unstoppable trend of digital transformation. IEC SG 12, IEC adhoc Group 86 on the Future of digital transformation and other related working groups are exploring ways to allow the IEC to work more digitally and produce more digital content.\nDigital transformation is the benefit brought by new and emerging technologies, which will change the way we work and live – for the better. Experts from different IEC National Committees and Technical Committees, and especially young professionals, should proactively greet and make contributions to the transformation in the IEC.\nAbout the author\nShuo Wang works for the Instrumentation Technology and Economy Institute (ITEI), which is the secretariat of China National TC124 on Industrial Process Measurement, Control and Automation (SAC/TC124). She focuses on national and international standards development in industrial automation and smart manufacturing areas. As an International Standardization Specialist at ITEI, Shuo is engaged in standardization works related to IEC/TC65, SC65A, SC65B, SC65C, SC65E and IEC/SyC Smart Manufacturing. She is a China delegate of several WGs in IEC TC65 and its SCs. Shuo was also elected an IEC YP Leader during the Young Professionals' workshop held in October 2019.\nShuo Wang has a Master’s degree in Instrument Science and Technology from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, as well as an Senior Engineer Qualification Certificate."

        "content": "The United Nations has defined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the foundation for its plan to build a better world by 2030. Also known as the 2030 Agenda, it recognizes that economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability must be addressed in tandem in order to achieve universal sustainable development.\nIn February 2019, with the aim of developing an IEC approach to SDGs, the IEC set up a new group, adhoc Group 84, with the primary objective of educating the IEC community about the SDGs and establishing SDG-related thinking in its standardization and conformity assessment systems.\nThe Convenor of ahG 84, Vimal Mahendru, provides his thoughts on the role of the IEC in helping to achieve the SDGs.\nWhat is the role of technology in helping to achieve the SDGs?\nTechnology is a big game changer. Across the world, it has lifted people out of poverty. Going back 130 years when, for the first time, Thomas Edison brought electricity to a small part of New York, technology has been the cornerstone of economic development and, as a consequence, has improved our lives through innovation.\nTechnology has brought us to this point in development and it will continue to take us forward. I think technology has the power to shift things in our society and the IEC can enable the shift by publishing the relevant international standards.\nI see the IEC as a custodian of society’s trust. The IEC assures the global community that products conforming to its standards are safe and that they will work for society, for development and also address environmental concerns. And given this mandate, the IEC must play a pivotal role in developing trustworthy technologies (through its standardization and CA systems), which further help achieve the SDGs.\nSDG 7 calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. Why is electricity so important for development?\nAbout 130 years ago, nobody in the world had electricity. And today, out of a population of 9 billion, 8 billion people have electricity. Almost everything in our daily life – entertainment, work, home – depends on electricity. It is the crux of the issue: there is hardly anything that we can do without electricity. You will be hard-pressed to think of your daily life without electricity.\nThe challenge also is that, even today, there are around 1 billion of our fellow citizens who do not have access to electricity at all, which is tough. The work of IEC SyC LVDC addresses electricity access based on the definitions provided by the World Bank and this standardization work has commenced.\nSDG 12 is about responsible production and consumption. How does this relate to the work of the IEC?\nCOVID-19 is a sudden shock and a rude awakening. It has reminded us that we need to urgently take better care of our shared planet. COVID-19 has shown utter disregard for geographical borders and notions of developed and developing. Our Earth has certain finite resources and we must use these resources in a sustainable manner by bringing circularity into our economies and not create mountains of waste. So, the IEC is introducing the notions of reduce, reuse, repurpose and recycle into its work. I am convinced that this will lead to a more thriving society without compromising on our planet. \nIEC Standards will bring a greater sense of responsibility and accountability toward citizens and the planet.\nMany companies are also addressing the SDGs. How can the IEC help industry specifically?\nIndustry is one of key stakeholders in the IEC. It has the motivation and ideas of how technology can be harnessed to make life better. However, IEC is not only about industry but rather about society as a whole and we have to ask ourselves how IEC Standards address the needs of society.\nUnderstanding how IEC Standards help to achieve the SDGs allows industry to invest in appropriate technologies, support standardization and bring about a better world."

        "content": "Reports that surgical masks cannot be recycled and that food packaged in plastic is making a big comeback, as people worry about contamination, have caused disquiet not only among environmental activists but also among consumers themselves.\nWe all know that plastic is difficult to recycle, takes literally ages to decompose when buried underground, pollutes our oceans and emits a variety of noxious greenhouse gases when incinerated. One of the problems is that plastic is everywhere. Polymers are found in electrotechnical products you would not even think of and these polymers are made of toxic substances. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of these toxic substances found in polymers used in the raw materials when manufacturing electronical and electrical devices. An example is carbon black, a substance which may be used to coat electric wires, for instance.\nNew standard\nIEC Technical Committee 111 prepares horizontal environmental standards in the IEC. It has just published a standard, IEC 62321-10, which provides manufacturers with test methods that will allow the electrotechnical industry to determine the levels of PAHs in their products. This will enable them to meet expected European regulation requirements (REACH SVHC) which limit the PAH content in the polymers to 1 mg/kg. The test method is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).\nGas chromatography works on the principle that a mixture will separate into individual substances when heated. The heated gases are carried through a column with an inert gas (such as helium). Mass spectrometry identifies compounds by the mass of the analyte molecule. A library of known mass spectra, covering several thousand compounds, is stored on a computer. Mass spectrometry is considered the only definitive analytical detector.\nIEC 62321-10 is part of a whole series of horizontal standards which deals with toxic substance testing across all electrical and electronic devices and systems. For instance, IEC 62321-7-1 describes a boiling water extraction procedure intended to provide a qualitative determination of the presence of hexavalent chromium in colourless and coloured corrosion-protection coatings on metallic samples.\n“Having an harmonized measurement method to declare the content of substances is important for the industry. It allows manufacturers to better understand and compare the declarations of their suppliers and ensure a better knowledge of hazardous substances in the final manufactured product,” says TC111 Chair Christophe Garnier.\nRead more about these and other IEC TC 111 Standards on https://tc111.iec.ch/"

        "abstract": "The IEC has recently published IEC 63152 to serve as a best practice tool for city planners.",
        "content": "Electricity is the backbone operating much of a modern city. It ensures safety through lighting and traffic signalling systems and enables communications with broadcasting, Internet and phone services. Medical equipment rely on electricity as do the electronic payments used in stores and banks.\nBut disruptions to the supply of electricity can occur. Hurricanes, earthquakes, severe droughts, and flooding are some of the natural catastrophes that are appearing more frequently and with greater intensity. These events can have a devastating impact on cities and the services provided to its residents.\nThe IEC has recently published IEC 63152 to serve as a best practice tool for city planners. Given the increased frequency of natural disasters and the destruction they cause, this standard proposes guidelines to sustain a variety of city services following a disruption.\nAccording to Tatsuya Shimoji, who serves as Project Leader for the IEC SyC Smart city project team on city service continuity, “We need to ask ourselves: if such a big disaster happens, how can we, as a city, survive? This is the concept that we are trying to address.”\nContinuity planning is a key factor to minimize cost and damage should critical infrastructure become inoperable. It ensures that potential disasters have been considered and local plans developed for the restoration of services. Because no city service can operate without electricity, getting the electricity supply to function again is the most urgent and important task following a disaster.\nAs Shimoji notes, “With this standard, we want to provide documented procedures to guide organizations and ensure the continuity of electricity supply to maintain city services. In order to secure services in a city at a minimum level during grid power loss due to a disaster, each organization which provides services should establish a business continuity plan to secure its electricity supplies appropriately.”\nPlanning and preparation is essential\nCities face many threats. Natural disasters, which can happen in any region of the world, have caused blackouts. Non-natural disasters, such as cyber and terrorist attacks, can also threaten a city’s electricity supply. And, as COVID-19 had demonstrated, we rely upon electricity for survival.\nAs Shimoji notes, “Disaster prevention is important. But, unfortunately, we cannot foresee when and where such a disaster will happen, nor can we completely escape the effects and damages caused by a disaster in reality. So, planning and preparation become very important tools to minimize the damage and keep city services available as much as is possible or to allow for the recovery of services as quickly as possible.”"

        "abstract": "The geothermal resources of the earth are vast, clean and plentiful.",
        "content": "Unlike most other renewable energy resources, geothermal energy is available throughout the year, has an inherent storage capability and is independent of weather conditions. Its storage capability makes it an ideal stabilizing energy, which can compensate for the fluctuating nature of other forms of renewable energy, originating from the sun or the wind.\nHow does it work?\n\nThe source of geothermal energy is the continuous heat flux flowing from the interior of the earth towards its surface. Geothermal power plants pipe hot water or steam through wells that sometimes reach deep down to reservoirs underground. The thermal energy is then converted into electricity using different technologies:\n\n\nDry steam power plants extract very hot steam from reservoirs in the earth. The steam activates turbines that generate electricity.\nGeothermal flash steam power plants use water temperatures of a least 182 C and convert it to steam to drive generator turbines.  When the steam cools, it condenses water which is injected back into the ground to be used again.\nGeothermal binary cycle power plants can use water temperature as low as 57 C. The thermal energy is used to heat a fluid that turns into steam at low temperatures. This steam is pushed through a turbine to generate electricity. The water never touches the fluid and is re-injected into the well, where it heats up again, closing the cycle. \n\n\n\nDry steam power plants extract very hot steam from reservoirs in the earth.

IEC International Standards ensure that systems and devices employed are tested and meet the appropriate standards of quality and efficiency. IEC Technical Committee 5 develops specifications and standards for the rating and testing of steam turbines. In 2020, it released the second edition of a key standard specifying the requirements for steam turbines: IEC 60045-1, which now includes automation safety specifications. The standard can be used for geothermal steam turbines but also for turbines employed in concentrated solar power plants, another form of renewable energy.\nViable alternative to fossil fuels as a result of COVID-19\nAs the price of oil has come down to historically low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is no longer covering the costs of drilling, etc…Many see this as an opportunity to encourage oil companies, which are already investing in renewable energies, to make the switch to geothermal energy.\n\n\"The overlap between geothermal and oil and gas is in exploring, drilling and production. With this comes expert understanding of the earth’s sub-surface. It takes expert knowledge to find the right spots to drill, how to drill, what equipment is needed, and how to use it. During the current crisis, many skilled workers in oil and gas drilling companies are on standby. These workers could be re-deployed to the geothermal sector,” says Marit Brommer, the Executive Director of the International Geothermal Association (IGA) in an interview on the REN21 site.\n\nIf oil companies do seize the opportunity to switch at least partly to geothermal energy, IEC International Standards are there to help."

        "content": "Many countries are working towards reducing their CO2 emissions in a bid to become carbon neutral. Denmark is a world leader in wind energy. Last year it sourced almost half of its power from wind (47%) according to Energinet, the country’s grid operator. Offshore accounted for 18% and onshore 29%.\nComplex wind turbine systems and components must be tested for different aspects including wind speed and direction, power performance, blade design and fatigue life, impact of diverse weather conditions and more.\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, offers testing and certification which reassures investors, manufacturers and users of RE technologies that these are safe, secure, interoperable and function correctly wherever they are in the world. The system covers the wind, solar photovoltaic and marine energy sectors.\nSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy A/S - Blade Test centre has become the first IECRE approved customer testing facility (CFT) stage 4.\nRasmus Ladevig heads blade testing at the Danish facility, which has tested more than 50 blades. Ladevig led the process and explains how it went.\nWhy is it important to be an approved customer testing facility within the IECRE System?\nThe most important thing for us is to create trust with our customers. By having the IECRE approval our customers can be confident that we have carried out the tests according to IEC International Standards, whether we do the wind turbine blade testing at our own test centre or externally.\nOur blades are sold with the IECRE approval. They are designed, manufactured and tested in compliance with internationally agreed content in the standards. Another important point is that IECRE third party certification includes not only an IECRE representative, but also another external testing laboratory representative to ensure objectivity throughout. Find out more in an interview with an IECRE Peer assessor for wind turbine blades. In addition to ensuring competent eyes on the theoretical part of testing, the peer review from other test centres provides an opportunity to strengthen the network between test centres. We have seen benefits through sharing of experience with e.g. health and safety aspects of blade testing.\nHow was the process to gain approval?\nThe process went very smoothly and professionally. The IECRE representative checked the structure of our quality management system and that we maintain our documents appropriately and the representative from the external testing laboratory from the Spanish National Renewable Energy Centre (CENER), did a deep dive to check that our more technical documentation was in place.\nCan you describe the structural tests?\nWe test the structural integrity of the blade.\nWe do static tests, where we pull the blade once quite hard to simulate a wind gust hitting it. The test is performed outside using mobile cranes or inside using pulling stations. The blade is equipped with loading clamps and is tested in four directions by rotating the blade on the test foundation.\nWe do dynamic testing where we move the blade 2-4 million times up and down to see whether it fatigues. This is more to do with the operation of the turbine over its lifetime. It can take roughly nine to 12 months for the entire process from the time we receive the blade, to preparing it and running all the tests."

Many technologies are available, yet no single solution has emerged that can be applied to all cities around the world.\nTo understand better the technologies available as well as some of the best practices underway, IEC SyC Smart Cities is hosting its first virtual workshop to discuss the sustainable digital transformation of cities. The workshop will focus on disruptive technologies and how standards can be used to support the roll-out and implementation of these technologies.\nAccording to N. Kishor Narang, the workshop moderator, “innovation and technology development are accelerating. Standards provide a foundation to support innovation, best practices andregulatory compliance requirementswhich are crucial for the sustainable digital transformation of the urban landscape”.\nDuring the workshop, interoperability between different systems used in smart cities will be discussed. Kyoung-Sook Kim from AIST will provide an overview of the national Smart City Reference Architecture set up in Japan with the aim of ensuring interoperability between and within cities.\nSpecific technologies that can help promote interoperability and scalability will be addressed including the OASC Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs), Context Information Modelling from FIWARE and TM Forum Open APIs.\nIn addition, Bart De Lathouwer from OGC will discuss dynamic digital twins that can be used in cities while Eric Simmon from NIST will address the underlying technologies enabling smart cities including; IoT, distributed computing, networking, sensing and actuating, system of systems.\nStandards can help leverage the benefit of new technologies. Not only do they allow for the provision of competitively priced and effective products and services, but they also provide clear descriptions of best practice and enable common approaches to tackling common challenges.\nMichael Mulquin, Chair of IEC SyC Smart cities, will provide an overview of the work underway in the IEC to support the standards community in developing a coherent set of standards that enable cities to implement smart solutions. A final presentation by Alexander Samarin from the IEC SyC Smart Cities will discuss the use of a systems approach to addressing the standardization of smart cities.\nThe workshop will end with a panel discussion that aims to the different approaches to smart cities can be converged into a homogenous framework.\nAs Narang notes, “this virtual workshop provides a great opportunity to understand how the systems approach can help scope out and design smart city initiatives, gain in-depth insights into the solutions offered by smart city standardization work and how the latest disruptive technologies can be leveraged within the framework of UN Sustainable Development Goals”.\nThe workshop, which will take place alongside the IEC SyC Smart cities plenary meeting, is expected to include participants from over 17 nations representing Europe, Asia and North America. Organized by the IEC Academy, it will take place on 17 July from 13h to 16h CET.\n \nRegister to participate\nVisit IEC Academy & Capacity Building to discover more webinars"

        "content": "According to the United Nations (UN), 840 million people in the world still do not have access to electricity, and most of them – around 580 million – live in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe aim of SDG 7, one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Achieving this goal is essential, because it will play a key part in ensuring other SDGs will be met.\nFor example, SDG 4, which is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, relies on people having access to affordable and reliable energy and specifically, electricity.\nEstimates from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), suggest that under a business-as-usual scenario around 600 million people in the world will still not have access to electricity by 2040. To avoid such an outcome, the focus is very much on off-grid renewable energy solutions which, helped by IEC International Standards, can enable people to gain access at a relatively fast pace to energy in locations where there is no electricity network.\nThe IEA estimates that to achieve the goal of universal electricity access, 70% of the rural areas that currently lack electricity will need to be connected using mini grid or off-grid solutions.\nOver 1 000 IEC Standards facilitate energy generation, transmission and distribution as well as access. Several of these publications are specifically used for off-grid technologies which harness renewable energy in various ways\nOff-grid electricity from renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind or hydro, also help populations to reduce usage of polluting diesel generators and potentially harmful kerosene lamps.\nThese solutions range from pico-solar lanterns, which enable people to keep businesses open in the evenings and children to do their homework after dark, to larger installations which help provide whole communities with lighting,  access to refrigeration for food preservation and water for drinking or field irrigation. Energy access thereby contributes to achieving several other SDGs, notably SDG 2, which is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.\nIEC TC 82 develops international PV standards for conversion of solar energy into electrical energy. It issues a series of technical specifications (TS) which make recommendations for small renewable hybrid systems for rural electrification.\nThe IEC 62257 series has been recognized by the World Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). Solar Pico systems are covered by these standards.\nLighting Global Programme\nIEC TS 62257-9-5 contains test methods that are used for evaluating off-grid solar products for solar modules up to 350 Watts. The methods were originally developed in 2008 through the joint programme Lighting Africa involving both public and private organizations as well as academia under the aegis of the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank.\nIt combines quality standards with conformity assessment activities, which provide assurance that products are reliable and safe. The programme began with pilot activities in Kenya and Ghana. In 2013, the Lighting Asia programme was launched. Since then it has expanded and is now implemented as Lighting Global across Africa, Asia, the South Pacific Islands and Latin America. \n\n“IEC TS 62257-9-5 is regularly revised, with new editions published in 2016 and 2018. By the end of 2019, almost 42 million products that met the Lighting Global Quality criteria, based on testing to IEC TS 622257-9-5, have been sold worldwide, benefitting an estimated 52,4 million people,” says Arne Jacobson, Co-Convenor with Leon Drotsche of the joint working group which produces the standards. The TC is about to release a companion TS to this publication – IEC 62257-9-8 – which specifies the conditions that need to be fulfilled to pass the test methods described in IEC 62257-9-5.\nMini grids for larger systems\nThe IEA estimates that by 2040, 140 million of the projected 315 million people living in rural Africa, will gain access to electricity, using 100 000 to 200 000 mini grids. A mini grid can be powered by generators, batteries, and/or renewable resources such as solar panels or wind turbines. As the price of solar PV has come down, diesel generators are gradually falling out of favour, as they use polluting fuel to operate.\nThey remain a back-up solution for many off-grid systems on the continent, however. But  several new mini grid projects across Sub-Saharan Africa are now powered by a combination of solar, hydro or wind energy and battery storage of energy.\nIn Ghana, for instance, the Ministry of Energy is driving off-grid deployment by firming up partnerships with other public offices and utilities such as Ghana’s Energy Commission and the Volta River Authority (VRA). The VRA is bringing five mini grid projects to the isolated lakeside and island communities along the Volta Lake.\nIEC is helping with the appropriate standards. IEC TC 8 is developing standards which specify the design and management of distributed energy resources (DERs), including microgrids.\nRead more about how other IEC Standards help energy access in e-tech"

That is according to UNESCO, which is monitoring this unprecedented situation.\nMany sectors, including education are rethinking how they work and prepare for a different future. All the while, parents are juggling working from home and assisting their children with distance learning.\nAt the same time, research by HolonIQ, a global education market intelligence firm, estimates the total global education expenditure to reach USD 8 trillion by 2025. It notes that education technology expenditure, fuelled by artificial intelligence (AI), is expected to double, reaching USD 341 billion by 2025. Its data indicates that despite an 11% annual growth, today’s education industry will leave 500 million students behind without serious and immediate transformation.\nNo-one knows how long this situation will last, but it raises urgent questions. How equipped are education institutions to conduct entire curriculums remotely? How will testing and teaching happen in the new classroom?\nFor anyone living remotely for whatever reason, how can we ensure every home environment is adequately equipped so that no one misses out on a quality education?\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 Quality education, aims to ensure that all girls and boys have access to and finish their free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education. It looks to ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university regardless of gender, disability or race.\nFor those with the technology it has been possible to follow classes at home during the pandemic, but for those without appropriate devices and reliable internet, learning has been severely affected.\n“To assist in closing the divide in education we need to make sure that devices and tools available for the learners can be used regardless of where they are located, the tools used by their educational institution, and their preferences for how educational experiences are delivered.\nThe only way to ensure this is to strengthen the work of standardization so that all technologies used are interoperable and ensure that they adapt to the learners’ abilities and the devices they have access to.\nOnly global standards can deliver on this promise, which is why global standardization for learning, education and training technologies are so important. When learning technology supports everyone in getting access to quality education, then we are supporting SDG 4, but implicitly laying the foundations for all other SDGs as well”, says Erlend Øverby, who leads IEC and ISO standardization work in the area of IT for learning, education and training (ITLET) in Subcommittee 36.\nExplore this topic\nRead the full interview with Erlend Øverby"

        "content": "Nearly 400 participants joined the IEC Academy webinar to understand better the role of the standards in addressing energy efficiency. Hosted by the IEC Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE), the webinar was moderated by Philippe Vollet, Chair of ACEE, with the participation of ACEE members Franco Bua, Luc Boutin and Jacques Peronnet.\nThe webinar provided an overview of the key principles of energy efficiency, its terminology and good practice for use in electrotechnical publications.\nUnderstanding energy efficiency\nThe IEC defines energy efficiency as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy. According to Franco Bua, energy efficiency consists of using less energy for the same performance, using the same energy for better performance, or improving the conversion of energy into electricity.\nEconomic growth implies an increased demand in energy. However, this demand in energy can have negative consequences for the environment. For this reason, energy efficiency is a cost-effective means for supporting the growing demand for energy while simultaneously limiting greenhouse gas emissions. As noted by Philippe Vollet, “energy efficiency is key to addressing the challenge to support energy policies while preserving the environment”.\nMany energy efficient technologies and solutions are readily available. Investments and a commitment towards energy efficiency abound, yet a number of barriers inhibits the deployment of energy efficiency solutions and impedes harvesting the full potential of energy efficiency.\nAccording to Vollet, standards have an important role in helping to “break the barriers”. He noted that standards provide agreements on performance between manufacturers, users and operations, disseminate and promote energy efficient technologies, and set minimum energy performance requirements.\nAdopting a systems approach\nA challenge for the standardization of energy efficiency is to provide a systems integration approach. While improving the energy efficiency of individual devices can lead to better energy outcomes, an integrated systems approach allows much greater benefit. As Bua notes, “there is a need for a holistic approach which is a shift from traditional standardization which tends to focus on products”.\nTo help IEC technical committees develop standards that can address energy efficiency, ACEE has developed Guide 118 and Guide 119 which, according to Vollet, “aim to give advice to TCs on the way energy efficiency should be considered and included in IEC publications to ensure a consistent approach in standardization”.\nGuide 118 seeks to harmonize the energy efficiency standardization and raise awareness that IEC publications can impact energy performance in both positive and negative ways. It provides a definition to the different aspects of energy efficiency that technical committees can address when developing standards and examples of how to do so.\nIn his presentation of Guide 119, Luc Boutin highlighted the need for a coordinated approach between IEC technical committees in order to achieve the best results for energy efficiency. According to Boutin, Guide 119 defines the technical and organizational procedures to follow for the preparation of these energy efficiency standards. It provides an overview of how a systems approach can be adopted and defines the types of publication (basic, group or product) based on the assigned energy efficiency function (horizontal, basic or group).\nGuide 118 and Guide 119 were initially developed in 2017 and are now in the process of being revised. As Boutin noted, “we welcome inputs from technical committees so that we can make sure to improve the next edition”.\nThe presentation and recordings from the webinar are available on the IEC Academy webpages."

        "content": "Many power stations and industrial plants are not equipped to deal with cyber security threats. A key issue, according to a recent IEC Technology Report, is that security is too often understood only in terms of IT (information technology).\nThose responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as energy, manufacturing, healthcare or transport. The growth of connected devices has accelerated the convergence of the once separate domains of IT and operational technology (OT).\nFrom a cyber security perspective, the challenge is that unlike business systems, industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are actually designed to facilitate ease of access from different networks. That is because industrial environments have to cope with different kinds of risk.\nIT security focuses in equal measure on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called ‘C-I-A triad’. In the world of OT, however, availability is of foremost importance.\nPriorities for OT environments focus on health and safety and protecting the environment. In the event of an emergency in order to be able to protect personnel or to minimize the impacts of natural disasters, it is therefore vital that operators can receive accurate and timely information and can quickly take appropriate actions, such as shutting off power or shifting to backup equipment.\nSCADA systems, which are used to oversee electric grids as well as plant and machinery in industrial installations, often rely on “security by obscurity”, reflecting the ingrained mindset that since no one knows or cares about their communications systems or their data, they don’t need to protect it. However, SCADA systems can now have widespread communication networks increasingly reaching directly or indirectly into thousands of facilities, with increasing threats (both deliberate and inadvertent) potentially causing serious harm to people and to equipment.\nThe retrofitting of appropriate and effective security measures has therefore become quite difficult for these SCADA systems. In the world of IT, for example, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs), are on the frontline of defence against malware.\nIDPSs are usually software applications that eavesdrop on network traffic. Depending on how they are configured, IDPSs can do everything from reporting intrusions to taking actions aimed at preventing or mitigating the impact of breaches. The challenge with SCADA systems is how to distinguish between normal data and potentially intrusive data that could cause harm.\nInternational standards provide solutions to many of these challenges based on global best practices. For example, IEC 62443, is designed to keep OT systems running. It can be applied to any industrial environment, including critical infrastructure facilities, such as power utilities or nuclear plants, as well as in the health and transport sectors.\nThe industrial cybersecurity programme of the IECEE — the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — tests and certifies cybersecurity in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to standards within the IEC 62443 series."

        "content": "The IEC 61850 Standards are a foundational series of publications which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They deal with issues such as the integration of renewable energies and distributed energy resources (DERs) within the electrical network.\nLaurent Guise leads one of the key working groups inside IEC Technical Committee (TC) 57, which prepares IEC 61850 Standards for distribution automation and DERs such as solar panels, storage systems and microgrids. It also supports the smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) through joint work with IEC TC 69, which develops standards for electrical power and energy transfer systems for EVs. Guise is also responsible for the digitalization of the IEC 61850 series.\nHe is equally an active member of the Systems Committee for Smart Energy (SyC Smart Energy) which coordinates the work of several TCs working to publish standards relating to the digitalization, automating and modernization of the grid, including grid edge devices and systems. He heads the working group which updates the smart energy roadmap.\nUnderneath, you can read an extract of the full interview he gave to e-tech.\nThe IEC 61850 publications are often described as core standards for the smart grid. Why?\nThey are strategic standards used for the rational management of electricity in the grid. Managing electricity in this new age of energy is increasingly complex. Distributed energy resources are everywhere: it can be a solar panel on the roof of a building but it can also be an electric vehicle plugging into the electricity mains or even a fridge, which can be viewed as a controllable load.\nOne of the problems is that electrical energy is difficult to store. To avoid any electricity shortage, a balance must therefore be established between usage and production. It was easy back in the days when big centralized power stations controlled everything.\nThis becomes more of a challenge when there are thousands of small producers of electrical energy. All these producers are difficult to control and some of the renewable energy sources, like the sun or wind, are fluctuating.\nWhat are the cyber security issues?\nDERs can make the grid vulnerable. They are points of entry and the multiplicity of these points of entry can be a problem if we do not implement cyber security procedures and technologies. The idea is to get each DER to implement its own security system.\nWe have come to realize that DERs can contribute to balancing the grid in a much more active way than we initially thought and that many aspects can be achieved, thanks to power electronics.\nThe IEC 61850 Standards are machine-readable. What are the challenges for the experts developing such standards?\nThe main users of the IEC 61850 Standards are machines and not people. Machines hate ambiguity even more than humans. That means that there is huge focus on semantics. We have produced a dictionary for machines and we released it in a machine-readable format.\nA great part of our work is to create digital models of all the different parts of the electrical network and its users, seen from a grid perspective. In effect, we are working with digital twins. In order to avoid ambiguity and to ensure the highest level of interoperability, we have made light code components available as a free download for market stakeholders involved in the supply chain\nThese are posted on the IEC website on the “TC 57 supporting documents” area, attached to specific licensing conditions.\nWhat are your more recent undertakings?\nWe are working on a second edition of IEC 61850-7-420, which includes a standardized function model for grid codes. Grid codes are technical specifications which define the parameters any DER connected to the grid must follow to ensure safe and proper functioning of the electric system.\nGrid codes are often specified in national regulatory requirements which impose specific energy behaviours in case of unexpected grid situations. The idea is to prevent a shortage from getting worse because of inappropriate but controllable actions – such as EVs plugging in the grid to recharge, for instance. This new edition also supports the aggregation of DERs, physically or virtually."

        "content": "2019 witnessed the largest increase in installed power capacity of renewable energy, which grew more than 200 gigawatts. This is one of the finding from the Renewables 2020 Global Status Report published by the non-governmental organization REN21.\nAccording to the report, countries in all parts of the world are moving towards renewable power. By the end of 2019, 47 countries across six continents had at least 1 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power in operation, compared to just 18 countries in 2009.\nThe share of solar PV and wind power has grown more than five times since 2009 which is due, in large part, to the continued decline costs for these technologies. Already four countries, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Uruguay, derived more than 30% of their electricity from solar PV and wind in 2019.\nYet, despite the growth in renewable energy, only 27% of global electricity is generated from renewables. Hydropower accounts for a 15.9% share followed by wind with a 5.9% share and solar with a 2.8% share.\nAs a result, REN21 has called on governments to put in place policies that actively support the uptake of renewable energy. According to REN21, “To make the switch, policy change is needed. GSR2020 shows that today’s progress is largely the result of policies and regulations initiated years ago. Policymaking must be collaborative, with decisions spanning and connecting the different sectors”.\nThe report also notes the public support for renewable energy continues to increase with opinion polls worldwide demonstrating that people are in favour of using more renewables and increasingly aware of the benefits of renewable energy.\nHow the IEC can help\nIEC Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems enable the safe and efficient use of renewable energy, including solar, wind and marine energies, whether integrated into the grid or installed off-grid to help remote communities access electricity.\nA number of IEC technical committees develop international standards for renewable energy systems. These documents help renewable energy systems to operate safely and efficiently, whether on-grid or off-grid. They also facilitate the integration of renewable energy systems in the electrical grid. \nThey include IEC TC 82: Solar photovoltaïc energy systems, IEC TC 88: Wind energy generation systems, IEC TC 114: Marine energy- wave, tidal and other water converters, IEC TC 4: Hydroelectric turbines, IEC TC  117: Solar thermal electric plants\nThe IEC runs four Conformity Assessment Systems, one of which is specifically designed for renewable energy systems. \nIECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) was established in 2014 to provide third-party certification of renewable energy equipment and services. This conformity assessment system facilitates the trade of equipment and services in the solar, wind and marine sectors while maintaining the required level of safety and expected performance."

        "content": "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged businesses in Australia to raise their defences as the government and essential services ward off sophisticated state-based cyber-attacks. Mr Morrison said the attacks spanned “government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure”.\nIn recent years, nation states have been turning increasingly to cyber warfare to achieve political, economic and military goals. As we are currently seeing in Australia, the attacks are not limited to government institutions, but they are also targeting private corporations to steal sensitive data that can be sold for profit.\nMost businesses can defend themselves by implementing an information management security system (ISMS), as described in ISO/IEC 27001. The well-known international standard defines a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology.\nUsing ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and for regulating access to critical information systems and networks.\nIn addition, ISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant publications. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nIndustrial plants and power stations face a different challenge. According to a recent IEC Technology Report, a key issue for them is that cybersecurity is too often understood only in terms of IT (information technology).\nThose responsible for security often overlook the operational constraints in sectors such as health, energy, manufacturing, or transport.

The aim of the full-scale load tests is to confirm an acceptable level of probability that the whole installed production fulfils the design assumptions.\nThe TS contains requirements and recommendations for the measurement of mechanical loads for activities such as site selection, data acquisition and verification, calibration, measurement load cases, uncertainty determination and reporting.\nThe TS also defines the requirements for full-scale structural testing of subsystems or parts with a focus on full-scale structural testing of marine energy converter rotor blades, such as structural integrity, and for the interpretation and evaluation of achieved test results.\nCertification de-risks renewable energy technologies\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, offers testing and certification which reassures investors, manufacturers and users of RE technologies that these are safe, secure, interoperable and function correctly wherever they are in the world. The system covers the wind, solar photovoltaic and marine energy sectors.\n“This certification is especially important for the funding of marine energy developments and projects. Investors need to be confident that marine energy equipment performs reliably and produces the expected output throughout its lifecycle. This IEC Technical Specification is part of a suite of marine energy Technical Specifications available to certify marine energy converters”, said Anton Schaap, Convenor of TC 114, adHoc Group 15 for the measurement of mechanical loads. Schaap also works for the Dutch Marine Energy Centre (DMEC) within the MET-Certified project.\nThe adHoc group was tasked with collecting and considering proposals for changes to TS-3 and collecting and responding to feedback on the application of this TS.\nThese load measurement tests can be performed by an IECRE approved testing laboratory and will be included in certificates issued by an IECRE certification body.\nThe IECRE marine energy sector is currently developing an operational document that will give guidance to testing laboratories on how to apply this new Technical Specification.\nFind out more about IECRE."

        "abstract": "There are some significant insights from the COVID-19 crisis. One positive is the importance of digitalization for almost every aspect of daily life, with millions able to continue working from home.",
        "content": "At the time of writing this column, it is the beginning of May and we are still in a state of Covid-19 emergency with the first cautious discussions about a way out beginning to take place. Nobody knows how long the crisis and its consequences will keep us busy. \n\nFor me, there are some significant insights from this crisis. Firstly, the position of individual nations is much stronger than many globalists and Eurocentrics predicted. For many, national governments and organizations have been the strong anchors in the storm. In my eyes, international organisations such as the European Union, United Nations, and the World Health Organisation played a disappointing role in the management of the crisis. Under these extraordinary circumstances, it was shown what the correct order of international relations should look like: not that international organisations are governing nations, but that strong nations are regulating and coordinating their relationships to the benefit of all participants by means of effective international organisations. \n\nHowever, my concern is that the lessons learned during the last few months will have a negative impact on the acceptance of other international organisations like the IEC and ISO. This is not good since we need the work of multinational organisations to harmonise international relationships. For the restart of the global economy after the crisis, the international standards and conformity assessment systems will play an essential role.\n\nThe role of science can be rather overestimated by people. I have the feeling that in developed western countries, science has taken over the role of a modern religion. There is a common belief that science is able to predict the future precisely and that science can always deliver the absolute truth and the right answers to any question. After hearing the numerous scientific statements and explanations on the news during the last two months, I cannot agree with this! For example, I remember the long scientific discussion in Italy about “Patient Zero” – the person who first carried the virus to Italy. One strong theory based on a scientific DNA analysis was that this single person came from Bavaria.\n\nOn the other hand, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle said that more than 300,000 Chinese people work permanently in textile factories in Lombardy, the hot spot of the coronavirus in Italy. Many of them went home for Chinese New Year and came back to Italy. Sometimes, adding one plus one can bring better results than blind belief in sophisticated science! \n\nDon’t misunderstand me, though. I think science is essential for human wealth and progress, however it needs common platforms for discussion and consensus between experts. Something like international standardisation works to find the smallest common denominator. In addition, it is important to not forget that the value of scientific knowledge is based on the correct use of scientific tools. We have a right to expect that people who create and announce official scientific statistics master the basic rules of statistical science and are able to distinguish between correlation and causality. \n\nIf there is a positive coming from the pandemic, it is the proven importance of digitalisation for almost every aspect of daily life. Millions of employees have been able to continue their jobs from home offices. In my company, we established shift work; one-half of the office working at home enabled the other half to keep necessary social distances.\n\nIt was quite surprising for me to see how well the work of national and international standard and conformity assessment organisations could be continued without any travel activities. Telephone conferences are in some respects more efficient than face-to-face meetings. Another surprise for me was the smooth transition to online lectures at universities. My students participate quite actively in my lessons despite the distance of 400km between us. \n\nAll this is a confirmation that the work the IEC is doing for the development of standards regulating the digital infrastructure is very important. However, we must not forget that as deeper implementation of digital channels in our private and commercial life increases, the danger of cyber-attacks also rises. That is why it is important to develop cyber security strategies and define them in international standards so that new and smart digital solutions can be developed.\n\nThorsten Arnhold is a member of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB), where he leads IEC efforts to promote conformity assessment activities. He is also the immediate past Chair of IECEx, which is one of the four conformity assessments systems of the IEC and which provides certification for standards relating to equipment used in explosive atmospheres. IEC is the only international standardization organization to provide four independent conformity assessment systems.

Defined as the ratio between output performance compared with the input of energy, it consists of optimizing energy input in order to achieve a similar or better performance.\nWhile many energy efficient solutions are readily available, barriers impede their full deployment. Standards, however, can provide tools to help overcome these barriers and promote energy efficiency. These tools include common measurements and test methods to assess energy usage, best practices for energy use and conservation as well as common efficiency classifications and minimum energy performance requirements.\nEnergy efficiency benefits when addressed using a systems approach. A fully optimized system may provide greater efficiency gain than that of an optimized single component. For this reason, a horizontal, systems wide approach is needed.\nGiven the energy efficiency standards will need to address a broad range of technologies and process, the IEC has set up an advisory committee on energy efficiency. This committee, ACEE, addresses energy efficiency requirements that impact a variety of IEC technical committees and provides guidance on the implementation of energy efficiency aspects using a systems approach. ACEE has developed IEC Guide 118 and IEC Guide 119 to help standard developers address energy efficiency aspects in their work.\nTo better understand the role of the standards in addressing energy efficiency, the IEC Academy is organizing a webinar on 23 June. This webinar, hosted by the Philippe Vollet, Chair of ACEE, with the participation of ACEE members Franco Bua, Luc Boutin and Jacques Peronnet, will provide an overview of the key principles of energy efficiency, its terminology and good practice for use in electrotechnical publications.\nThe webinar will provide an overview of Guide 118 and Guide 119 as well as present a practical example of how these publications can be applied in low-voltage electrical installations and product standards.

        "content": "Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our homes became the ultimate refuge against the virus. We all felt – and still feel – safer in confinement, but especially vulnerable groups: the elderly, people with pre-existing conditions and some specific disabilities.\nElderly people living in care homes turned out to be much more at risk from COVID-19, as it spread like wildfire, reaping many deaths in its wake. One of the main advantages of care homes, the social aspect of living together, turned out to be an Achilles’ heel.\nTo mitigate the risk, our parents and grandparents were forced to stay in their rooms for hours on end, isolated from one another and their own relatives. The pandemic highlighted problems health professionals and governments are already aware of: on the whole and unless it can’t be avoided, it is better for elderly people to live in their own homes as long as possible, with the assistance of specific technologies and services.\nThe same can be said for people with disabilities. And going one step further, most of us found it in our interest to use telemedicine to contact our doctors, rather than risk being infected by visiting their surgery.\nActive assisted living (AAL) services are therefore becoming more obvious alternatives for most of us. During the height of the pandemic in Europe and Asia, AAL services were not only more convenient and safer, they help to prevent social isolation rather than favour it.\nThe older generation could use various teleconferencing tools to stay in touch with their families and medical staff, as we all did and are still doing in many countries as the pandemic continues to be a threat. Friends organized concerts, cooking recipes were shared and some even cooked together while several miles apart.\nEconomic evaluation of AAL\nIEC is leading the way in developing standards relating to AAL services. It set up a systems committee, IEC SyC AAL, to promote safety, security, privacy and cross-vendor interoperability in the use of AAL services. SyC AAL has published three innovative publications, which are targeted at health funders, whether private or public, and manufacturers of AAL equipment.\n“The idea is to make the full business case for AAL services, looking at different variables, including cost. We want to convince health funders that with AAL systems, you get the greatest benefits for the money you invest,” says Paul Boissoneault, one of the SyC AAL experts much involved in the development of the documents..\nThese standards are particularly innovative because they branch out into economics. “Economic evaluation is not something the IEC usually does but we felt that promoting AAL services in this way makes a lot of sense, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,” agrees Chair of SyC AAL Ulrike Haltrich.\nIEC TS 63134 lists use cases of AAL services. IEC 63234-1 establishes a framework for the economic evaluation of AAL services, while IEC 63234-2, looks specifically at the monitoring of patients with chronic diseases.\nEvaluating the monitoring of chronic diseases makes a lot of sense. “Chronic diseases represent a growing percentage of illnesses in societies where people are living much longer than fifty years ago. Looking at how best to monitor these, and at what cost, can help health systems make the right decisions in an informed manner,” Boissoneault observes.\nFor Haltrich, it is all part of the new normal. “Ideally you will be able to hire services for whatever you need, using the IoT, artificial intelligence and, why not, robots. Cyber security will be an increasing issue for us, as well. Technology is moving fast and we are looking into all of this."

        "content": "The  International  Energy Agency (IEA) says that energy efficiency can play a vital role in economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Paris-based intergovernmental organization, more efficient use of energy could generate an untapped source of fuel, larger than fossil and renewable energy sources combined.\nEnergy efficiency can improve the economic competitiveness of countries and businesses, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of life. The challenge, according to IEA projections up to 2035, is that as much as two-thirds of the energy efficiency potential are likely to remain untapped.\nA major issue is that energy efficiency is invisible, it represents energy not used. Public and private stakeholders do not always understand the value of energy efficiency and instead focus on investments in energy generation.\nA number of IEC technical committees (TCs) are leading the way in the field of electrical energy optimization. The IEC Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) has been set up to coordinate activities between the different IEC TCs that contribute to this area.\nHundreds of IEC International Standards apply energy efficiency considerations to every aspect of electricity generation, distribution, and its use by billions of devices and systems. IEC work supports the roll-out of more energy efficient technologies including those that make better use of primary energy and help reduce overall energy waste.\nThe 20 thousand experts who work in the IEC at the global level continuously update and improve IEC International Standards and with them the efficiency of all relevant devices and systems.\nIEC work for energy efficiency helps improve industrial productivity in a number of areas. For example, during the innovation process, IEC International Standards allow companies and research laboratories to assess incremental gains in energy efficiency compared to competitive devices and systems that are already installed and available in the marketplace.\nThe whole wind industry measures the performance of wind turbines based on the criteria that are described in IEC International Standards. Regulators, insurers and investors know exactly what to expect from a new turbine: how it will perform at different wind speeds that are classified in IEC Standards; their endurance in terms of abrasion rates; how much power it is expected to deliver depending on where it is installed.\nThe performance of new designs can directly be compared with existing designs and installations. IEC International Standards are also essential in uprating and upgrading outdated installations since they provide the necessary and internationally recognized metrics and guidelines to improve performance.\nFor example, they provide the technical basis for the refurbishment of hydro installations with more efficient hydraulic turbines. Engineers learn how to proceed and what mistakes to avoid during installation, maintenance, and repair.\nAs countries emerge from lockdown and set about rebuilding their economies using energy more efficiently could help to stimulate growth. Longer term, increased efficiency will make it easier to cope with ever increasing demand, as the population increases and developing counties industrialize.\nIt will also ensure that enough energy will be available for future generations."

        "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic systems are an investment. A new rating system under development by IECRE will help assess the risk exposure of a PV power plant investment in a more effective and uniform way.",
        "content": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are an investment. Turn-key capital expenditure has come down significantly over the past 10 years, suggesting electricity costs (order of 40 EUR/MWh). These often are below those of conventional electricity generation technologies – though not available 24/7 on a standalone basis.\nNevertheless, the rule of thumb is that the main share (order of 70%) of the lifetime cost of approximately 20 years is immediately related to fixed costs resulting from the investment – and this assumes low interest rates given the current market environment.\nHence, customers and investors must know if a system really is efficient, and how much more they would be willing to invest, to ensure they get a system that yields the projected technical and financial performance including over the long haul.\nPerformance risks are everywhere, but the main defects occur at production of components and installation. Operations and maintenance also play a significant role when it comes to performance losses.\nClimatic conditions, such as hot and harsh climates, dust and sand storms, can corrode plastic component parts, including cables, the junction box and back sheets. Under certain circumstances, they can also cause abrasion to the glass panels, or soiling, which can result in significant performance losses given the significantly reduced transmission. Partial or complete destruction of components and safety hazards, also related to connectors, is often reported.\nDeveloping a rating system for solar PV systems within IECRE certification\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, offers certification of the entire lifecycle of a PV power plant, from initial design aspects to annual inspections and ultimate asset transfer. It uses IEC International Standards which cover many critical design, quality, safety and performance aspects.\ne-tech caught up with Thomas Sauer, who recently took up as Convenor of the IECRE PV sector working group to find out the latest on the planned new rating system for solar PV. Sauer is also President and CEO at EXXERGY, a consulting firm that focuses its services on renewable energy and glass technologies.\nWhy do we need a PV rating system and what will it achieve?\nIn order to effectively mitigate risks that come with solar PV equipment and systems, certification would ideally be complemented by a rating system. Such a rating system is currently under development and in the decision process at IECRE, significant progress has been made over the last 12 months. Compared to a certification that typically follows a “pass” or “fail” logic, a rating system will allow a much more differentiated view on the safety, healthiness, expected longevity, and performance of a PV power plant. This allows adding an important aspect, sustainability: A safe, healthy (well manufactured and maintained), and high performing PV power plant with a long life expectancy, is also sustainable by way of making efficient use of resources.\nThe new rating system under development by IECRE will be based on IEC – and complementary expert criteria to help assess the risk exposure of a PV power plant investment in a more effective and uniform way.\nSignificant progress was made on the structural design of the rating system last year. Following further consultations with the PV and financial sectors and the EU Commission, the rating system is now designed in a modular fashion and will initially concentrate on the inception phase and on operation and maintenance across three scales: utility, commercial and industrial (C&I), and residential.\nThe ratings are designed to cover the product qualification level, the process level (manufacturers, EPCs, O&M service providers), and the execution level (supervision) resulting in a project rating ranging from AAA as the highest, down to D where the project doesn’t meet standards at all.\nWhat are the benefits?\nA rating system allows for a finer differentiation than a “simple digital” pass-fail system and is expected to strongly reduce the rating pressure in marginal cases since the difference between an “AA” and an “A” will likely be perceived marginal, and therefore, more acceptable than a “pass” versus “fail”. Naturally, at the tipping point between “B” and “C”, there will still be pressure points, though a system rated “B” will involve significantly higher risks than a system rated “AA”.\nAlso, possible errors that may happen during the design and construction may result in reduced consequences for the actual technical and financial results. The difference in risks of neighboring ratings is relatively small compared to a pass-fail system, and therefore, the rating system is expected to be better differentiated as result of the evaluation process.\nMost importantly, investors – that are ultimately the customers – particularly institutional investors are used to evaluating risks in the terminology of ratings, and therefore, this technical oriented IECRE rating system for solar PV installations will hopefully be broadly adopted by the financial sector, as it represents an attempt to translate complex technical risks to its own language.\nWhat are the next steps?\nMy new appointment chairing the PV sector working group at IECRE underlines EXXERGY’s commitment to supporting IECRE to continue to gain momentum. Part of my plans, pending the approval of the Renewable Energy Management Committee (REMC), is to more actively involve the PV industry and stakeholder groups, similar to the proven good practice of the wind sector within IECRE.\nIn the meantime, we’ve started several initiatives. IECRE PV Sector actively contributes to the EU Commission’s sustainability initiatives for the PV sector: Ecodesign, Energy Label and Green Public Procurement. In this spirit, IECRE has assumed a significant role in the joint mission group Eco-Design and Energy Labeling / WG5-ECO, jointly led by the European Technology and Innovation Platform (ETIP), SolarPower Europe, PVThin, esmc, and IECRE PV Sector.\nIn order to provide a more market-oriented solution for PV, we hope to submit an application for the first – basic level – PV rating system to the REMC by September for voting at its next meeting in November. If we can’t hit that deadline, we would engage in a vote by correspondence expecting a ballot latest in Q1/2021. We then plan to develop an advanced system.\nThe efforts so far would have been impossible without stakeholder participation, for which we are very grateful.\nWith the intended launch of the basic level IECRE PV rating system expected in 2021, investors will be able to get an idea of their risk exposure from a predominantly technical point of view – from low to high – for the particular PV power plant investment.\nAbout IECRE\nIECRE, addresses specific requirements of the solar PV, wind and marine sectors and offers tailored conformity assessment solutions. It covers the design, manufacture, transportation, installation, maintenance and testing of RE equipment.\nAbout EXXERGY\nEXXERGY is a network of leading expert consultants for the renewable energy industry and the glass industry. EXXERGY is involved in and supports several non-profit activities, including IECRE, SolarPower Europe, and others. To enable other industry participants to support EXXERGY non-profit work, a non-profit organization has been formed, TEXXECURE Rating Foundation GmbH."

        "abstract": "The ISO/IEC 11889 standard, commonly referred to as Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is a hardware-level security solution that can play an important role in protecting connected devices.",
        "content": "More than 25 billion connected devices were in active use around the world in 2019 and that number is expected to reach 75 billion in the next five years. But the cost of our workplaces and homes becoming smarter and more connected is that they are more vulnerable to cyber attacks than ever before as the threat surface expands.\nGone are the days when we only had to worry about protecting our computers and smartphones. Nowadays we have to be aware of the risks that refrigerators, thermostats, industrial machines and other systems pose to network security.\nThe ISO/IEC 11889 standard, commonly referred to as Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is a hardware-level security solution that can play an important part in protecting connected devices. A TPM chip provides a crypto processor, which secures hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.\nA TPM chip has a unique public-key cryptosystem. It works by giving users two keys: a public key, shared with everyone, as well as a private key.\nThe keys are large numbers that form part of an intricate mathematical algorithm that scrambles a user’s messages. The sender encrypts a message by using the receiver’s public key in order that only the intended recipient can unlock it with her or his private key.\nEven though the public key is freely available, the numbers involved are sufficiently large to make it very difficult to reverse the encryption process with only the public key.\nIn IACS (industrial automation and control) environments, TPM chips can be built into network firewalls, as well as into control systems. TPM firmware is available for lower risk devices.  \nThe chips ensure that only authorized users can gain access to data. This makes them especially important in industrial, medical and business environments, which store highly sensitive information. \nAlthough ISO/IEC 11889 is a very important and highly effective tool, technology can only ever be part of the solution. TPMs work best in the framework of a holistic cyber security strategy that also covers people and processes.\nImplementing international standards such as IEC 62443 and the ISO/IEC 27000 family is the best way to create a successful cyber security programme, especially when combined with testing and certification (conformity assessment). Such an approach increases the confidence of stakeholders by demonstrating not only the use of security measures based on best practices, but also that an organization has implemented the measures efficiently and effectively."

        "abstract": "What we do today for our cities will have an impact on our collective future. Under this trend, Smart Cities are emerging across the world and becoming a normal feature of urban life.",
        "content": "Our world is constantly shaped by so-called mega-trends: trends that are broad, global, and dramatically impactful. No matter what lenses are applied, urbanisation is one of those predominant mega-trends, which is changing our cities and the way most of us live.\nWith the projection that 68% of world population will be living in cities by 2050[1], cities will be the homes for most of us to live, dream and achieve.\nOn the other hand, such cities will experience an increase in inequality between societal groups with respect to resource, social status, economic power etc. What we do today for our cities will have an impact on our collective future.\nUnder this trend, Smart Cities are emerging across the world. The concept itself originates from 1990s[2]. However, due to the rise of smart devices, unprecedented network connectivity, and the growing computing and analysing capability, the trend of digitally connected cities is growing rapidly. Whether you feel excited, passionate, curious, threatened, or even scared; Smart Cities are becoming a normal feature of urban life.\nInterestingly, Smart Cities do not have a single defining feature, as there is still no universal definition[3]. In fact, it highly depends on what perspective is used to view the topic. For example, it can be viewed from a horizontal-vertical domain perspective or from an asset lifecycle perspective. This is largely due to the breadth of the Smart Cities scope, different stakeholders’ focus areas, and the ever-evolving concept and technology. As a social-technical experiment with many knowns and unknowns, many considerations should be given when its development is still at the very beginning.\nWe should consider data first. Data has become one of the most precious assets of our cities. However, in many smart cities’ projects, we have seen that technology is implemented first without thinking of the use case of data governance. A data-driven smart city should place citizens’ privacy and trust in the first place. If misused, data could be detrimental that could cause disastrous consequences to all stakeholders and shake the faith in Smart Cities experiments.\nWe should collaborate on a larger scale. Within the cities, collaboration is critical both horizontally and vertically across domains, such as utility services, transportation, public services and built environment. A cross-disciplinary approach is very important for Smart Cities’ success – because we do not want to build silo systems in Smart Cities. On the international level, successful experiments in one city should be shared and replicated to other cities where relevant and for the lessons learnt.\nWe should follow a citizen-centric design approach. Technology should never be implemented for its own sake. It must solve actual problems and add value to citizens. Rather than being icing on the cake, Smart Cities should become indispensable to solve pressing problems in urbanisation. Not only in wealthy cities, but more imperatively, in under-developed, over-crowded, and resource-scarce cities.\nThat is why we should develop standards. Standards reflect the collaboration of industries and countries, reflect successful reference solutions, and reflect the current best practice. Global experts from the IEC community have been collaborating and developing standards, from holistic reference models to domain-specific applications. Eventually, we want to see that no matter what aspects of Smart Cities are discussed, there will be standards that provide reliable guidelines and trustworthy solutions for the design of future Smart Cities.\nWe still have many miles to go in this standardisation journey.\n\n[1] United Nations, 2018\n[2] Albino, Dangelico & Berardi 2015, p. 4\n[3] One definition from ISO/IEC 30182:2017: Smart City is a city with effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens\n\nAbout the Author\nBaoying Tong is a 2019 IEC Young Professional Leader from Australia.

        "content": "World Environment Day is celebrated every year on June 5 to raise awareness and to encourage action to protect the environment. Normally millions of people would be taking part in thousands of registered activities around the world, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s event is the first digital World Environment Day.\nIEC International Standards, especially when combined with conformity assessment (CA), help countries and industries to protect the environment and building a sustainable future. All IEC Standards and CA activities work toward achieving a minimal impact on the environment and optimal use of resources.\nIEC energy efficiency standards can play a significant role in the fight against climate change. Others address the substances and processes used in the manufacture of electrotechnical equipment and systems.\nCommonly referred to as “hazardous substances” these are elements or compounds which can have serious consequences on the environment or human well-being. IEC expertise is being used by government regulatory authorities around the world to ensure that the optimal solutions are put in place to manage these substances.\nIt is predicted that a large percentage of electrical energy will be produced by renewable sources in the future. Large-scale use of renewable energy is important as it helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels, combat global warming and raise the living standards of people in developing countries.\nIEC International Standards help these technologies become marketable. They provide a foundation for certification systems, promote international trade of uniform high-quality products and support the transfer of expertise from traditional energy systems.\nThe IEC has a dedicated advisory committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) which coordinates and guides the IEC’s efforts to ensure that IEC International Standards don’t include specifications which would harm the environment. In addition, Technical Committee (TC) 111 is dedicated specifically to writing International Standards on environmental aspects of electrotechnology. \nACEA and TC 111 are heavily involved in IEC work on the so-called circular economy. This is a more sustainable economic model that re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption.\nWhile many efforts are required to keep up with the pace of developments in renewable energy technologies, the IEC is dedicated to setting International Standards that serve the planet in this market sector. The IEC has several technical committees working in the field of renewable energies, looking at areas such as hydropower, ocean power, solar energy, wind turbines and fuel cell technologies.\nThrough its activities in renewable energies, the IEC is contributing to global efforts, helping industry and government mitigate the effects of climate change."

        "published_day": "2020-06-04",
        "abstract": "The IEC has published a number of standards to ensure the performance and safety of solar PV modules.",
        "content": "According to the Global Energy Review 2020 report published by IEA, solar photovoltaics (PV) accounts for the fastest growing renewable energy source. In 2019, one-fifth of all renewable capacity deployed globally consisted of individuals and small businesses installing solar PV modules on their roofs.\nThe IEC has published a number of standards to ensure the performance and safety of solar PV modules. For example, the IEC 61215 series contains various test methods that induce mechanical stresses in order to meiecasure how well the PV module can withstand various loads. While these test methods include a variety of stresses, experience in the market has demonstrated that a specific test method for measuring resistance to snow loads was needed.\nThe IEC has responded to this market need and recently published IEC 62938. This new standard provides a method for determining the load-bearing capability of framed PV modules when subjected to non-uniform snow loads.\nIn 2013, the number of reports about bent and misaligned PV module frames in areas with heavy snow increased. According to Jörg Althaus, initial Project Leader for IEC 62938, “large systems in mountain areas had large numbers of modules breaking. In particular, modules in the lower rows of sloped installations were affected”.\nThe mechanical load testing used in the IEC 61215 series assessed uniform loads on a horizontal plane. However, because many PV modules are placed in an inclined position, snow will slide down the panel and accumulate unevenly at the bottom edge of the frame. As a result, the lower part of the module will need to withstand greater stress. Additionally, ice may accumulate between the frame and the glass thus causing further stress to the PV module.\nWith IEC 62938, non-uniform snow load tests simulate failure types similar to those in field conditions and thus reflect real snow impact to the PV modules. As Althaus notes, “IEC 62938 allows manufacturers to ensure that their modules are usable is high snow load areas and can therefore use the standard to show that they are superior (test to failure) in comparison with other modules in the market“.\nSpecifically, the test determines the load limit of the PV module. Six modules are used with five modules tested to their failure limit while the sixth module is stressed with approximately 63% of the mean load of the five modules beyond their failure limit.\nWork on IEC 62938 began as part of a research programme funded by the European Union and North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany together with the support of TÜV Rheinland. Further information on non-uniform snow impact on PV modules can be found in an EUPVSEC paper."

Some of these standards are used to impose regulatory requirements whereas others are used as part of a compliance tool kit to help manufacturers and suppliers meet regulations and other initiatives.\nJager will discuss what standards are relevant, how they work together and where they sometimes conflict. Among these, the new edition of IEC 62474 will be explained, as well as the IPC-175x family. (for more information on both standards, read: https://chemicalwatch.com/104775/expert-focus-how-standards-and-benchmarks-can-help-electrical-and-electronics-businesses-meet-regulatory-requirements )\nJager is one of the driving forces inside IEC TC 111, where he leads many of the standardization efforts on material declaration. IEC TC 111 prepares horizontal environmental standards for electrical and electronic products and systems. Their aim is to mitigate the impact  of these products on human health as well as on resource depletion or water pollution. Standards are also essential tools in the fight against e-waste, while aiding manufacturers to meet legislative requirements on toxic substances control.\n \nClick here to attend or to find out more about the conference"

        "abstract": "Investors and end-users were among the more than 100 participants from around the world who took part in a webinar about standardization and certification for offshore renewables.",
        "content": "Some 140 participants from around the world joined the Ocean Power Innovation Network (OPIN) and Marine Energy Alliance (MEA) projects webinar on the topic of standardization and certification for offshore renewables on 19 May.\nThe webinar was co-organized by WEAMEC and DMEC, as part of the OPIN and MEA projects, which are financially supported by Interreg North West Europe.\nA summary report, including the webinar recording and all presentations, is available here.\nPeter Scheijgrond, Convenor of the IECRE Marine Energy Working Group on the scope of certification, discussed the benefits of using IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\n“We want to demonstrate to investors and end-users that our marine technologies are reliable and fit for purpose in order to help raise project funding. By applying the rigor of the IECRE System and standards through certification, we will reduce risks, increase market confidence of our technologies and thus advance our sector”, said Scheijgrond, who works with the Dutch Marine Energy Centre (DMEC), where he manages the EU funded MET-CERTIFIED and ENCORE projects.\nThe benefits of IECRE for marine technology developers, manufacturers and users\nThe marine technology market is very international. It takes time to design, test and manufacture products and devices, and these stages can take place on different continents.\nIECRE is an internationally recognized system, which uses standardized, harmonized and transparent procedures for testing and reporting, based on principles of international consensus. International standards are created by and for the sector. Some of the benefits include:\n\nReciprocal acceptance between test labs and certification bodies around the world\nAn international system which helps increase market exposure for technologies\nOffers an opportunity for new market services for test labs or certification bodies that want to become accredited under the system\nAssurance of technical competence, integrity and quality of your development.\n\n \nIEC Technical Specifications for marine technology\nIEC Technical Committee 114 develops international standards for marine energy, including wave, tidal and other water current converters.\nPublished Technical Specifications (TSs) include terminology, scale testing, design requirements, load measurements, technology qualification, moorings, electrical power quality and acoustics.\nAdditionally, there are performance and resource assessment TSs for wave, tidal and river energy. These aim to establish how much energy is in the wave, how it is measured, over what kind of duration, and what methods and calculations are used to build a reliable power matrix against which to run a power performance assessment.\nAbout IECRE\nAn ever-increasing demand for electricity, and the need to reduce fossil fuels power generation, have led to rapid development and growth of the RE sector. IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, was established in 2014 to address the specific requirements within this sector, which are not covered by the existing IEC Conformity Assessment Systems.\nIECRE aims to facilitate international trade in equipment and services for use in RE in the marine, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy sectors, while maintaining the required level of safety."

        "content": "Beer Opatsuwan is an active contributor to standards development in Australia as well as at the IEC. He currently serves as the alternate member on the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB), in support to Kareen Riley-Takos, Standards Australia’s General Manager Operations.\nBeer first participated in standardization work at the international level as an IEC Young Professional, attending the YP workshops in 2014 – 2016 and has since been a strong advocate for the YP Programme.\nBeer currently works for Energy Queensland which operates Australia’s largest electricity distribution network. In his role as Manager Intelligent Grid Program, Beer is responsible for the development and maintenance of intelligent grid solutions project governance and coordination for Energy Queensland. In 2015, Beer was recognized as Queensland young professional engineer of the year.\nStandards Australia profiled Beer in its recent e-news and has kindly allowed the IEC to republish the interview below.\nWhy do you think standards are important?\nThere are three reasons that come to mind:\n•            Standards are a powerful channel to influence our society for the better. Amongst many positive forces is the potential for standards to level the playing field for stakeholders across various sectors thus fostering competitive markets.\n•            They’re a robust facilitating platform to foster Australia’s economies leveraging the diversity of thought.\n•            An enabler to market monopoly disintegration and a catalyst for new technology acceleration.\nYou are the IEC SMB alternate for Kareen Riley-Takos, what has that experience been like so far and what is to come?\nIt has been a steep learning curve as the IEC is a complex organisation. I have been able to gain insights into the IEC management framework, its strengths, weaknesses and have been rapidly formulating ideas into how to make a positive impact.\nThe first SMB meeting in New Delhi that I attended was a huge eye-opener for me. I was able to interact with many experienced SMB members from across the globe, each providing me with their perspectives to help solve pressing matters to the IEC.\nMy vision for the IEC is to advocate for agile operations as a critical pillar for IEC and Standards Australia to keep up with a rapidly changing world. As a former Young Professional, I strive to be the glue between the IEC Young Professionals Programme (emerging leaders) and established leaders to attract/retain the world’s best leaders/experts in the field to support the work of standardization.\nWith Kareen’s depth of standardization experience and support, I want to work with her to inspire trust and foster strong linkages and relationships between IEC, Standards Australia, the Australian electrotechnical sector and other National Committee members.\nHow can we get more young people involved and educated about standards?\nThe conversations regarding standardization need to start at the grass-root level. I see an opportunity for standardization bodies to work with universities and generate an awareness of national and international standardization.\nYoung professionals should be aware that they can make an impact on the standardization forum. The old-age mentality of standardization is reserved for experienced professionals nearing retirement needs to be eliminated.\nWhat do you think is the future of standardization?\nThe standards platform becoming more agile in its operations whilst maintaining consensus rigour. Standards will be borderless, inclusive, exciting, balanced, digital-centric and readily accessible.\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning will increasingly be used to coordinate and harmonize intellects from the industry. The standards development systems are becoming more autonomous with a huge amount of operational insights feeding in. This in turn creates more powerful and balanced standards – just look at what Google and Facebook are doing.\nThe original interview can be found in the Standards Australia e-news."

        "content": "While perovskite solar cells are often touted as the next generation of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, their instability has hampered commercial development. However, scientists in Australia have found a new method to increase the stability of metal halide perovskite cells to the point that they are able to pass the testing requirements of IEC 61215.\nThe appeal of perovskite solar cells has pushed researchers to find ways to that can make possible the adoption of this new technology. Their low cost, flexibility and extreme light weight make them an ideal replacement or complement to the existing silicon-based cells currently in use. And because perovskite solar cells are 500 times thinner than silicon cells, they could be used as a coating on objects as varied as drones and buildings.\nHowever, perovskite solar cells do not have the durability of silicon-based cells. When exposed to outdoor weather conditions, unprotected perovskite solar cells become unstable and release gas from within their structures, thus leading to their decomposing, in a process known as outgassing.\nScientists at the University of New South Wales and University of Sydney have found that the use of a low-cost polymer-glass stack with a pressure-tight seal they could supress the perovskite outgassing. As a result, the perovskite solar cells have been able to meet the requirements of IEC 61215 and allow for their commercial development.\nIEC 61215 specifies the test methods to use to determine whether PV modules are suitable for long-term operation in general open-air climate. By ensuring that modules can withstand exposure to repeated temperature cycling between -40 degrees and 85 degrees and to exposure to 85 percent relative humidity, these tests are used to demonstrate the viability of PV modules in all types of outdoors weather conditions.\nSpecifically, the perovskite solar cells survived more than 1800 hours of the damp heat test and 75 cycles of the humidity freeze test, exceeding the requirement of IEC 61215  for the first time. The testing is operated by IECEE which is one of the four IEC Conformity Assessment Systems."

        "content": "The IEC is working on a new standard which aims to define the configuration languages required to achieve digital substations, including the human machine interface (HMI) applications. The planned document, which is currently being drafted, will be part of the IEC 61850 series of publications, which includes some of the core international standards used for integrating digital communication processes into the electrical grid.\nOne of the objectives of the publication is to automatically generate the HMI application, including all the associated data mappings and graphical renderings. This effectively dispenses operators, engineers or technicians from carrying out a manual configuration of the substation system and therefore saves time and cost for utilities by using resources more efficiently.\nIt also removes the risk of human error. “You could call it ‘magical engineering’: instead of taking weeks, sometimes even months, to configure the HMI applications, it literally will take minutes and even seconds for smaller substations,” says Dustin Tessier, who leads the task force responsible for the new standard project at the IEC.\nThe task force has circulated the second draft of the standard in May. The aim is to publish the new document in 2022.\n“IEC 61850-6-2 intends to support data-driven configurations using a combination of three configuration languages (GCL, HCL, SCL), which will allow a large portion of the HMI to be automatically configured using standard configuration files. The HMI is an engineering intensive application, and this standard aims to minimize the amount of engineering effort,” Tessier explains.\n“The idea is to place the engineering burden on the tools and not the users/technicians. We believe IEC 61850-6-2 will have a significant impact on global grid modernization efforts and predict it to be a key component to any digital substation. With the support of the Standards Council of Canada, we are proud to be leading this global initiative,” adds Ryan Baht, one of the experts developing the new standard inside TC 57."

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has showcased the disadvantages of city life. Dense populations, polluted air and a heavy reliance on public transportation are among the conditions allowing the current pandemic to spread.\nYet, the pandemic also provides an opportunity for urban planners to address ways to improve city life. With fewer drivers commuting to work, pollution has decreased. Roads have been re-appropriated by bikers and pedestrians, with miles of new bike lanes appearing nearly overnight. Commercial property is losing its appeal as more employees work from home which could, in turn, lead to new uses for empty buildings.\nBecause, ultimately, the appeal of city life is unlikely to disappear. As centres of culture, education and entertainment, cities will continue to thrive and attract tourists and new residents. Instead, COVID-19 provides the opportunity to consider how a city is structured, maintained and can be improved.\nLeveraging the benefits of smart cities\nThe smart use of data and technology can help cities enhance quality of life, services and sustainability. For example, smart technologies can improve transport services, support businesses and monitor air quality.\nData are the foundation of a smart city. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the ability to easily and cheaply collect data and, using algorithms, it is possible to analyze the data in real-time in order to formulate an overall picture of what is going on in a given area and how it can be improved. As a result, residents can enjoy the benefits of data and technology to learn more about their surroundings and make more knowledgeable choices.\nYet, as Google’s Sidewalk Labs recently learned following the opposition to their plans for the Quayside project in Toronto, local community involvement is essential and issues regarding data collection and usage must be addressed.\nWork of the IEC\nThe IEC has developed many standards that are important for the efficient functioning of cities. However, rather than addressing each of these standards in isolation, the IEC developed a systems approach to smart city standards.\nThe SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of various IEC committees as well as other groups such as ISO with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems.\nWhile SyC Smart Cities may develop some systems standards, such as frameworks or use cases, its most important role is to bring the expertise of the 20,000 IEC experts to help solve the problems of cities, and to collaborate with other standards development organizations to develop coherent packages of city standards"

JDF is a part of the Linux Foundation, offering members a platform for the development of technical specifications.\nAs an ISO/JTC 1 PAS submitter, JDF can now propose specifications to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for consideration as ISO/IEC International Standards. JDF has already done so with the submission of its Open Chain specification.\nISO/IEC PAS submitters\nTo become a Publicly Available Specification submitter, an organization must fulfil an extensive set of criteria. These criteria are put in place to ensure that the process for developing specifications is neutral to all contributors and includes industry-wide participation. Once developed, the specification needs to represent an industry-wide consensus and be written in accordance with PAS editing standards.\nOnce approved as a PAS Submitter, an organization can put forward its specifications to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for approval by its members. The submission is balloted using the Draft International Standard and Final Draft International Standard approval procedures used for all ISO/IEC Standards. The process ensures that the PAS Submitter is fully engaged in the ISO/IEC approval process and that the final standard does not diverge from the initial submission without the PAS Submitter’s consent.\nTo date, over 115 ISO/IEC Standards have been approved using this streamlined process. Current approved ISO/IEC JTC 1 PAS Submitters include the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), W3C, OASIS and The Open Group. A full list is available on the ISO/IEC JTC 1 website.\nBenefits of ISO/IEC standardization\nISO/IEC International Standards offer recommendations for safety features, quality measures and interoperability. By becoming an ISO/IEC standard, a technology benefits from global acceptance of products, accelerated adoption and expanded reach. It joins a globally recognized technical ecosystem.\nOpen Chain specification\nAs an ISO/IEC PAS Submitter, JDF has proposed its Open Chain specification for consideration as an ISO/IEC International Standard. The specification, available since 2016, identifies the requirements for a compliance programme throughout a software supply chain using open source. By becoming an international standard, the Open Chain specification seeks to facilitate the adoption of its compliance programme around the world.\nThe Linux Foundation has previously submitted the Linux Standard Base core specification which became a series of standard, the ISO/IEC 23360 series, in 2006 and which are publicly available standards."

        "content": "The circular economy calls for a radical shift in production and consumption. Continual cycles recover and restore products, components and materials through strategies such as reuse, repair, remanufacture and, ultimately, recycling. It is a systemic approach to managing resources.\nMaterial efficiency is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the preservation of materials by making products more durable and repairable. It also facilitates the recovery and recycling of material at the end of the product life. The ultimate objective of material efficiency is to keep materials in use for as long as possible – and potentially forever.\nMaterial efficiency can be placed into a hierarchy during a product’s use and waste phases. The most favourable strategies call for the design of products associated with a longer product life using the least amount of natural resources, while the least favourable strategies represent the loss of a material resource by incinerating the material and recovering its energy. In a truly circular economy, landfills are not an acceptable option.\nDesigning products for material efficiency\nIn the design phase, manufacturers should consider the materials used in the construction of a product. For example, they can try to reduce the amount of materials used by optimizing the product design, and by selecting recycled materials or reused components.\nFocusing on the use phase, products should be designed in such a way that their lifetime can be extended by making them easy to repair and upgrade or reuse. Since products will be reused (including refurbishment or remanufacture), and thus have multiple owners, manufacturers should also facilitate upgrades of soft- and hardware and the removal of sensitive data. Also, parts should be designed to endure multiple cleaning and dis- and reassembly cycles.\nProducts should be designed for an efficient end-of-life. This means that useful materials and components can be easily and safely recuperated by, for instance, making the product easy to disassemble.\nHow standards can help\nTo facilitate products to last longer, standards are needed to ensure that, amongst others, product safety, performance and reliability are sufficiently taken into account. Issues such as data removal and security must also be considered as products are reused and change ownership.\nMoreover, a holistic approach is needed to ensure that the protection of the environment is not detrimental to areas such as product safety, EMC and performance.\nLegislation is expected to require the increased use of used parts as well as products that can more easily be repaired or remanufactured. Standardized methods and tools will be needed to assess aspects such as the proportion of reused components or recycled content in a product, and how to assess the ease (or difficulty) with which a product can be repaired or remanufactured. Also, standards will be needed to guarantee the properties of the used material, as well as to define the requirements for parts reliability. \nWithin the IEC, several committees have developed standards that support material efficiency for electrical and electronic products. Some examples include:\n\nIEC TR 62635 with information on product end of life, including the recyclability rate calculation.\nIEC TR 62824 with guidance about material efficiency considerations in the eco-design of products.\nIEC 62309 which examines the dependability of products containing used parts.\nIEC 63077 which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment.\n\nNew standards covering requirements for material efficiency in the design of products, such as circular ready design, are needed and plans are underway to start such standardization work in the IEC.\nThis post is based upon an article available in e-tech."

The remote sessions build on that, but you’ve already got the rapport. \nWhen you’re facilitating and chairing a pure remote meeting, you can’t read the room as well if there’s no visual contact. People may not be as engaged.\nYou can’t have a coffee break or sit down for a face to face discussion. It is difficult to structure the meeting in a way that you can deal with certain topics, have a break, take some issues offline and have some further one on one discussions.\nWhen you’re just online, things really change — typically, most online meetings focus on one or two particular areas. But we’re in a situation this year where we don’t have a choice. It’s a case of finding out what does and doesn’t work. Of course, what works for some teams might not work for others.\nTechnical Committee 106 were due to all meet in Canada in April but we converted the series of Working Group and Project Team meetings to occur the same week, but all online.  One of the best parts of it was a virtual coffee break in one of the larger Working Groups, where we stopped for 15 or 20 minutes and we just went around the group.\nThere were 30-odd people and we were just talking like we were sitting next to each other and sharing not our work, but just sharing our local experiences. You could see the room ‘light up’, you could see the faces get more engaged.\nThe meeting changed after that because people were actually more engaged in the overall process. As leaders, it’s up to us to read the room and structure the meeting so that we can engage with people.\nWhen there’s a lot of people, you also need to reach out to those that aren’t speaking. Some people with English as a second language might not contribute as much online.\nI think we’re all going to learn. One of the groups I like to turn to in these sorts of scenarios are our IEC Young Professionals because they’ve grown up online and do a lot of their work online.

        "content": "Numerous trials and studies are underway, as global medical and healthcare professionals race to find a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID 19. What is already clear, however, is that people with existing medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, are more likely to catch the virus and succumb to it.\nAround 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The most common is type 2 diabetes, occurs when the body doesn’t make enough insulin. Over the past three decades, the prevalence of this type of diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels.\nGiven these numbers, a faculty of representatives from primary and specialist care have developed a consensus document on the management of diabetes for people at risk of or with confirmed COVID-19, for use in both primary and specialist care. The recent international study was published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, and is entitled Practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. It highlights the following:\n\nDiabetes is one of the most important comorbidities linked to the severity of all three known human pathogenic coronavirus infections.\nPatients with diabetes have an increased risk of severe complications and multi-organ failure.\nDepending on the global region, 20–50% of patients in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had diabetes.\n\n \nThe document emphasises the importance of patient sensitization for optimal control of the condition and monitoring of plasma glucose and several other aspects.\nIEC Standard for wearable diabetes sensor\nAs healthcare technologies advance, there have been important breakthroughs, including wearable glucose sensors.\nA continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a tiny sensor inserted under your skin, usually on your stomach or arm. The sensor measures your interstitial blood sugar levels, which is the glucose found in the fluid between the cells. The sensor tests glucose every few minutes. A transmitter wirelessly sends the information to a monitor, which can be a mobile phone. Much handier and user friendly than pricking your finger and using a paper stick which was the way people routinely monitored their diabetes until recently.\nAn alarm can sound when your glucose level goes too low or too high. You can note your meals, physical activity, and medicines in a CGM device, too, alongside your glucose levels. You can download data to a computer or smart device to more easily see your glucose trends. Parents can monitor children with a mobile phone.\nIEC 60747-14-10 specifies the terms, definitions, symbols, tests, and performance evaluation methods used to determine the performance characteristics of wearable electrochemical-glucose sensors for practical use. It can be applied to all wearable electrochemical-glucose sensors for consumers and manufacturers, without any limitations on device technology and size.\nThe international standard is published by IEC Technical Committee 47, which covers semiconductor devices which use sensor technology."

        "content": "Nanotechnology is considered to be one of the key technologies of the 21st century. It is defined as the manipulation of matter at the atomic or molecular levels and includes the many areas of research that explore matter occurring below a certain size.\nNanomaterials are expected to become the building blocks for the next generation of products that will be used in industries as diverse as healthcare, electronics, renewable energy and consumer goods.\nExamples of its application include bone healing and regeneration, the ultrafast transmissions of data and nearly infinite data storage. Using materials that are lighter and can last longer improve industrial machines, such as wind turbines, as well as consumer equipment. It is a market that can be segmented by product or material type (i.e. nanowires, graphene) or by application (i.e. lighting, energy storage, photovoltaic cells).\nNanotechnology is already present in the electronics industry and will make further inroads. It will be used to make computer processors more powerful, replace computer flash memories, provide novel approaches to optoelectnroic devices and reduce the energy consumption of displays. Nanosensors will be used in many industries from manufacturing to medical diagnostics while nanowires will help to create cheaper and more efficient solar cells.\nTwo new IEC publications\nIn early May, the IEC published two technical specifications, IEC TS 62607-2-4 and IEC TS 62607-8-1 which are part of the IEC 62607 series of publications for nanomanufacturing.\nCarbon nanotubes are tubes made of carbon with diameters typically measured in nanometers that are noted for their strength and flexibility. IEC TS 62607-2-4 provides test methods to determine the resistance of individual carbon nanotubes. It specifies the test method for determining the resistivity and the contact resistance of an individual carbon nanotube and the reliability of the measurement.\nAccording to the IEC Project Leader for these publications, Hiro Akinaga, “IEC TS 62607-2-4 describes the protocol to evaluate the resistance which is one of the most important characteristics of carbon nanotube (CNT). Material manufacturers of CNT require the protocol since the individual CNT are of nanometer dimensions and the characteristics are very sensitive to the protocol and the measurement conditions”.\nThermally stimulated current (TSC) measurement are a widely used method for information about the charge trapping and electric polarization phenomena of various materials such as dielectrics, semiconductors, and organic materials. TSC measurement can also be used to evaluate the defect states and structures in nano-enabled materials. IEC TS 62607-8-1 provides the test method for doing so.\nThere are two types of TSC measurement methods which are classified by the origin of the current. One is generated by the detrapping of charges while the other is generated by depolarization. IEC 62607-8-1 focuses on the detrapping of charges.\nIEC nanotechnology standardization\nIEC Technical Committee 113 provides standardization of nanotechnologies relevant to electro-technical products with technical experts representing 35 countries. To date, it has issued 42 publications.\nThe full potential of nanotechnology is still being explored. According to Akinaga, “the mission of IEC TC 113 includes bridging scientific achievements with practical technology and developing a healthy and competitive environment in industry with solid scientific knowledge”."

        "content": "Wind turbines are complex machines made up of many components. They tower over their ancestor windmills with long, thin long blades. Their design and maintenance require careful consideration, of the materials used to build them and the climate and weather conditions they are exposed to.\nThey come in many sizes. Large, utility-scale turbine blades may be more than 75 metres long, so that the rotor diameter is over 150 meters – larger than the length of a football field. Turbine towers can reach 100-150 metres tall. In total, if such a blade were pointing upright, the entire structure could be anywhere from 175-225 metres tall.\nSafety first\nManufacturers must ensure their turbines can endure extreme winds. They must also be able to handle fatigue loads, since blades can bend in fluctuating winds and forces. Tall wind turbines also sway back and forth, and the blades may vibrate. One way to do this is through certification.\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, offers third-party certification of wind energy equipment and services to consensus-based international standards. This ensures safety and reliability which reduces risks, streamlines costs and enhances market access. IECRE also covers solar photovoltaic (PV) and marine energy equipment.\nDaniel Aranguren is a Peer Assessor for the IECRE System. He is an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Centre of Spain, (CENER) and conducts blade assessments in the Wind Turbine Test Laboratory (LEA), according to IEC Standards.\n\n\nDaniel Aranguren\n\n \n\nWhat is the process for testing a blade?\nIEC 61400-23, Full-scale structural testing of rotor blades, states that the blades of a wind turbine are one of the most critical components of the entire wind turbine generator system, and the main purpose of the tests is to verify that the whole population of a blade type fulfils the design assumptions.\nTo accomplish this task the blade must undergo a complete testing campaign, mainly comprised of:\n\nStatic load tests: assess the ability of the blade to withstand the most severe design load conditions. For this purpose, the load is applied at a low velocity in several sections of the blade until test loads are reached. Usually this test is performed for different load distributions or orientations, in order to represent the different extreme load cases.\nFatigue tests: assess the ability of the blade to withstand fatigue loads, that is to say, the objective is to apply cyclic loading to reproduce, in an accelerated way, the overall fatigue life of the structure.\nTest for determining other blade properties, such as mass, centre of gravity or vibration modes and the lightning protection system (LPS).\n\n \nWhat are some of the challenges?\nFor most blade testing facilities, including our laboratory at CENER, blade length is becoming the major challenge. Blades are getting longer, and no one knows, or can anticipate, where the final limit will be. This poses huge technical challenges for testing laboratories, to construct new facilities which can meet manufacturers needs and try to foresee the future path of this industry. It’s a complex task to correctly size and, therefore, determine the investment to be made.\nWhat does an IECRE Peer Assessor do?\nAs Peer Assessor, I manage all technical aspects during the whole assessment process. My primary task is to make sure that applicants meet the requirements defined in the IECRE rules.\nMy main task as a blade test engineer involves designing and performing structural tests on full-scale blades according to international standards. This means defining the technical specifications of the tests and the management and commissioning of measurement equipment and test tooling. Once the tests have been carried out, testing measured data is post-processed and used for the test report. This final product is delivered to the customer.\nThe process, once the assessment team (Lead and Technical Assessors) is formed, is as follows:\n\nSet up an online meeting to clarify what the process will be and agree assessment date.\nBefore the onsite visit, the assessment team usually requests some documents for review in advance.\nCarry out onsite visit – from one to three days.\nOnce onsite, hold introduction meeting: give an overview of the assessment process and hear presentation of the company to be assessed.\nAssessors then visit the facilities accompanied by laboratory staff.\nThe assessment team splits into two and begins tasks. This is typically a collaborative job between the applicant and the assessor. For me, this is the most interesting part of the process. It offers all the people involved the opportunity to hold very useful discussions and it’s an invaluable chance to talk to colleagues doing the same job in other locations.\nOnce completed, the assessment team meets to discuss findings and a close out meeting with the applicant staff is carried out to provide outcomes.\n\n \nAn engineer with a passion for music\n“Music is a very important part in my life, more than a hobby.”\nAranguren has played the violin since he was nine. He qualified as a violin teacherin 2001, after 12 years of study, but never worked as one. Music was always a hobby and when it came to the crunch and he had to decide whether to study engineering or continue with music it was clear: while he loved music, he wanted to be an engineer for his career.\nThe compromise…\nAranguren played with a chamber group (mainly weddings) for a while but at age 20, joined a group, and hasn’t stopped playing since. Comprising ten people – three violins, two trumpets, guitar, vihuela, guitarrón (bass)and male and female vocals – they play mariachi music in cities and neighbouring villages. The Mariachi Zacatecas’ latest album is on Spotify and they are also on Facebook and Instagram."

        "content": "As more renewable energy sources and other distributed energy resources (DERs) interconnect with the electricity network, the risk of cyber attacks increases. The IEC 61850 series, as well as other core standards for the smart grid, are evolving to take these augmenting risk factors into account.\n“If you have a problem with your computer you can just switch it off and reboot. You can’t do that with the electricity grid. You need to maintain a continuous supply and that’s why securing the grid is so important,” says Frances Cleveland, the head of one of the working groups inside IEC Technical Committee 57 which publishes many of the key documents paving the way for the automatization and digitalization of the electricity grid.\nWG 15 issues publications addressing data and communication security aspects in the electricity network. Among its key publications isthe IEC 62351 series, which provides guidance on designing security into systems and operations.\nOne of the roles of the WG is to undertake standards development for the security of the communication protocols defined in the IEC 61850 series, among other core smart grid standards published by TC 57. IEC 62351-6, for instance, was developed to secure the operation of all communication protocols based on or derived from IEC 61850, including those defined in IEC 61850-8-1, IEC 61850-9-2 and IEC 61850-6.\nCyber attacks on critical assets like the electricity supply network can seriously disrupt the continuity of electricity delivery. With the multiplication of DERs connected to the grid, such as renewable energy sources like the sun or wind, the number of points of entry to the electricity network has increased massively.\nThese multiple points of entry are not managed by a central control centre, such as a power station for instance, which means that the cyber security standards protecting the control centre need to be extended even down to residential homes.\n“Cyber security is needed everywhere and we need to convince all the different stakeholders involved and there are many of them, from the manufacturers, the vendors, the installers, right down to the aggregators and the utility regulators, of that necessity,” Cleveland explains.\nRole-based access control\nOne of the ways of improving the cyber security of DERs is by defining role-based access to the systems. “You need to set up permissions with special access and be able to monitor who can and can’t perform certain tasks, like update the settings, for instance,” Cleveland adds.\nThe IEC is developing a technical report, IEC TR 61850-90-19, tying role-based access control and permissions as defined in certain IEC 62351 standards, to IEC 61850 devices and applications.\n“The idea is to get DER stakeholders to build systems which integrate cyber security aspects right from the start, in other words systems that are secure-by-design. If they think about cyber security once the system is already out there, it will be a bit like applying a band aid to a life-threatening injury,” Cleveland says.\nOne of the challenges is finding a way to make complex documents like the IEC 61850 or the IEC 62351 standards more directly targeted or customized to specific users, involved in the DER supply chain.\nCleveland is also an active member of the IEC Systems Committee for Smart Energy, whose role is, among many tasks, to coordinate the work of several technical committees working to publish standards relating to the digitalization of the grid and facility automation in general."

The focus of this year’s event is the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis year’s international day comes as some countries begin to ease restrictions designed to protect public health and gradually allow businesses in some sectors to reopen.\n\n\n\nBefore businesses reopen measures should be in place to ensure employees can at all times keep two metres apart from co-workers and customers. Employers must disinfect surfaces and provide their staff with face masks, hand sanitizers and barriers, when needed.\nThe overarching goal is to establish a workplace that is free from any hazards that could cause death or serious physical harm. The UN estimates that more than two million people around the world succumb to work-related accidents or diseases every year.\nEnsuring safety is one of the key principles guiding the work of the IEC.\nThrough its international standards, the IEC ensures safety is an integral aspect of devices and systems, thereby protecting people, critical infrastructure, economies and the environment. These standards can address aspects of safety that apply to many products or specifically address a single product type or industry.\nThe IEC has a dedicated technical advisory committee on safety (ACOS) which guides and coordinates IEC work on safety and ensures that all IEC Standards address safety issues.\nThe IEC operates four Conformity Assessment Systems to ensure that devices and systems comply with the requirements established in its international standards."

        "content": "In the field of computer technology, human to machine interfaces have progressed from the use of punch cards to onscreen textual commands and graphical user interfaces. Recent developments have incorporated touch screens and voice commands commonly used with digital assistants, tablets and smart phones.\nMore than 20 years ago, the joint IEC and ISO technical committee for ICT (ISO/IEC JTC 1) established a subcommittee that provides standardization in the field of user system interfaces (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35). It seeks to provide standardized and user-friendly interfaces for all users, including those with accessibility issues or with special needs, and ensure that the interfaces can be adaptable across cultural and linguistic barriers.\nThe Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35, Khalid Choukri, explains more about some of the subcommittee’s standardization activities.\nThe work of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35\nWe would like to make sure that people can control or navigate their devices using a visual, auditory or tactile modality. For example, we can use our voices, body movements or gestures similar to those we use with our smartphones as interfaces in a standardized way. What we would like to do is ensure that such interfaces serve all users, including the ones with specific needs.\nIn addition, our work specifically addresses culture adjustability and linguistic compliance. This is one of our main objectives. We try to go beyond the basic legal obligations with our recommendations on developing user interfaces.\nInteracting with computers through voice commands\nWe have worked since 2015 on the possibility to convert text into audio information but also audio into text like we see with subtitles and captioning. We would like to have the audio descriptions standardized with some explicit requirements. Our corresponding guidelines, ISO/IEC TS 20071-21, are under review to account for recent developments.\nIn terms of text to speech, we need to address speech detection. We have an initial standard for voice command which we developed several years ago but now we would like to work on a more sophisticated voice recognition project that can consider human and machine interaction using continuous speech.\nOne of our working groups is looking at speech interaction using full duplex which means that the speaker can speak at the same time as the machine. There is no interruption needed to, for example, push a button after asking the machine a question, which can be unnatural.\nAccessibility is an important work area\nSC 35 has published a number of standards related to accessibility. We have recently published ISO/IEC 29138-1 on user accessibility needs and ISO/IEC 30071-1 which provides guidelines for developing accessible ICT products and services. We have adopted a holistic approach and would like to make sure that organizations developing these products and services are aware of the requirements surrounding accessibility.\nMoving forward, we need to make content easy to read and easy to understand.\nRead the full interview in e-tech"

        "content": "Ultra high voltage (UHV) transmission systems offer the ability to transport electricity over long distances with minimal power loss using either alternating current (AC) or direct (DC) current. \nWhile DC transmission provides less energy loss when travelling over greater distances, AC transmission can allow for branches within the transmission lines and thus connect to several different cities.\nGlobal deployment\nThe former Soviet Union launched the first commercial UHV transmission line connected the nearly 500 kilometres between the towns of Ekibastuz and Kokchetav in Kazakhstan in September 1985 with a voltage of 1 150 kV.\nOther countries have since adopted this technology. A pilot project was put into place in India in 2012 using AC transmissions which has since been expanded while another UHV system using DC transmission is near completion. A 2 500 km UHV system has been built in Brazil using DC transmission that connects the energy from the northern part of the country to the population centres in the south. In China, the largest number of UHV transmission lines have been built using both DC and AC transmission.\nAs the demand for electricity increases worldwide, power transmission lines will need to provide greater capacity. The use of renewable energy, generally from sites located far distances from cities such as offshore wind farms or photovoltaic installations in deserts, will require high transmission capacity over long distances. For these reasons, the need for UHV transmission systems will increase in the future.\nStandardizing UHV AC systems\nStandardization of UHV AC systems is underway. In 2013, the IEC set up a technical committee, TC 122, which provides standards for UHV AC transmission systems exceeding 800 kV. TC 122 provides system level specifications used for the design, construction and operation of sites rather than the equipment standards.\nAccording to the Secretary of TC 122, Eiichi Zaima, “the integration of technical knowledge from all stakeholders is the key to develop well-balanced international standards in TC 122”.\nLiaisons with CIGRE\nThe IEC has been working closely with CIGRE, a global members organization that develops and shares technical expertise in power systems. The two organizations have cooperated on UHV standardization since their joint international symposium on UHV transmission which took place in Beijing in 2007.\nTC 122 work programme\nSince 2014, TC 122 has published three technical specifications and one technical report. The technical report, IEC TR 63042-100, provides an overview of the guidelines and standards for UHV AC transmission systems with the aim of ensuring the reliability, availability, and environmental aspects of the systems.\nThe published technical specifications provide inform the requirements for UHV AC transmission systems related to their voltage regulation and insulation design (IEC TS 63042-101), substation design (IEC TS 63042-201) and on-site acceptance tests (IEC TS 63042-301).\nCurrent areas of work include general systems design, transmission line design, commissioning and guidelines for the measurement of UHV AC transmission line power frequency parameters.\nAs Zaima notes, “with electricity demand increasing, UHV transmission technology is becoming increasingly essential for the future supply of power”."

        "content": "To this day, the main source of renewable energy remains hydro power. A key IEC 61850 Standard specifies the role of this much relied upon source of energy and helps it interoperate with the electrical network as it gets digitalized and automated.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hydropower represents 20% of energy generation worldwide. In many countries around the world, it is the biggest source of electrical energy. In Norway for instance, more than 90% of the country’s electrical needs are met by hydro power.\nStabilizing the grid\nAs more fluctuating sources of renewable energy such as sun and wind become integrated into the grid, hydro power plants help maintain constant power quality and stabilize voltage levels by ensuring that there is always the right amount of power available for the continuous transmission and distribution of electricity.\nHydro power is extensively used for electrical energy storage on a large scale, so-called pumped storage. Electricity is used to pump water into reservoirs at a higher altitude during low electricity demand periods. When demand is at its highest the water is piped through turbines situated at lower altitudes and converted back into electricity.\nPumped storage is useful to control voltage levels and maintain power quality, when intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power are connected to the grid.\nInternational standards are required to not only specify turbine runners and impellers, define acceptance tests of hydro turbines, etc., they are also crucial to help with the interoperation of hydropower plants with the grid, as whole systems are becoming digital and automated, in other words “smarter”.\nIEC 61850 for hydro \nThis is where the IEC 61850 series comes in. They are foundational standards which pave the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. Published by IEC Technical Committee 57, they deal with key issues such as the integration of renewable energies and distributed energy resources (DERs) within the existing electrical network.\nOne of these standards, IEC 61850-7-410, deals specifically with hydro power. “We have been using hydro power for hundreds of years so there is a long history behind it. Hydro power stations have very specific requirements, for instance relating to machines or computers dealing with water flow, rotational speeds and so on.\nIEC 61850-7-410 covers those aspects,” explains Erik Wejander, who heads the working group which publishes the standard inside IEC TC 57.\nMeeting thermal requirements\nThe standard can also be used as benchmark tool for thermal power plants. “The model and solutions proposed are also applicable to thermal power turbines and generators, to a high degree. The most recent edition of the standard has therefore been written to meet the demands of this wider audience,” Wejander says.\nHis working group liaises closely with IEC TC 4 which prepares standards for hydraulic turbines. The group applies the modelling structure and object designations standardized by IEC TC 3.\n“We have developed the data model for the hydraulic turbine governor together with TC 4. As systems get smarter, new possibilities are opened up by big data and how to make the best use of it.\nOne key to success is to have machine readable solutions structured in a standardized way. That is one of the driving forces for the roll-out of smart grids,” Wejander indicates.\nThe working group has 43 members, most of which come for the utilities sector. “We are very user-driven. The standard is machine-readable.\n“One of the key requirements from the utility sector is that the specifications should also be platform independent. The owners of hydro power plants want to be able to roll out smart technologies without worrying about proprietary systems and power plant specific hardware solutions,” he adds.\nNew technical report\nThe group is working a new edition of a technical report, IEC 61850-7-510, which explains how to apply the standard to be released by the end of the year.\n“It will be based on the coming ISO/IEC 81346-10 specification and will show how to apply IEC 61850 and the Structured Code Language software to a functional model of the power plant processes. The report is designed to help those who work on the modelling of power generation process applications and will give many examples of how to apply the standard,” Wejander describes."

        "content": "We are entering a new way of working and collaborating at the IEC this year given the global COVID-19 issues we are all facing.  It’s certainly an unprecedented situation and one that comes with many different emotions, stresses and ways of coping. On a personal level I am still coming to grips with this new world we face.\nStandardization is a key aspect of the global community we all share and right now that couldn’t be more relevant for the work of the IEC, which underpins international trade in electrical and electronic goods, affordable infrastructure development, smart urbanization and transport systems, sustainable energy, and the safety and security of people and the environment. \nThe work of the technical committee I chair, TC 106, is of crucial importance to telecommunications.   Society has embraced mobile telecommunications in recent years and it has become an integral part of daily life.\nAlong with fixed networks, as a society we have never been as dependent on telecommunications to be connected as we are in 2020. It has skyrocketed overnight.\nIf we stop for a moment and look at the role of TC 106, it’s at the heart of the wireless telecommunications that the whole world depends on.  Ensuring we have the appropriate electromagnetic field (EMF) safety testing standards and methods for devices and networks is essential and this is reflected in our revised TC106 Strategic Business Plan. \nBut more fundamental to how the IEC delivers these important global standards is the wellbeing of all our experts, teams and conveners, so we can work as efficiently as possible in these challenging times.\nWe will all be experiencing different challenges with our level of contribution varying — I know I am certainly finding some days far more difficult than other days. I guess a key message is that we are a global family and need to support each other far more now so that we can all succeed. \nTC 106 meetings, like those of other TCs, will be virtual online and whilst this brings challenges, it’s also an opportunity to learn what works well and what needs adjusting.  However, we have to be realistic about the delivery and timing of our work, as some projects will need longer.\nOn the other hand, perhaps some things can be done more efficiently. It will certainly be an interesting experience.\nWhilst we represent our IEC National Committees and relevant stakeholders, ultimately, we are delivering global standards for everyone.  In the IEC family, we should all be asking ourselves how we can support each other and also the upcoming IEC Young Professionals who are our future leaders and inspire new thinking.\nWith the help of IEC Central Office, we must share feedback on how we can best make this work, and pool new ideas and suggestions for alternatives to try.  The collective power of the IEC family will define and empower us!\n \n____________________________________________________________\n \n\nAbout the Author\nMike Wood is Chairman of IEC Technical Committee (TC) 106, which prepares International Standards on measurement and calculation methods to assess human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields.

        "content": "Call centres can be a source of frustration for many people. Long wait times, automated responses and endless rounds of soothing music can result in a negative customer experience. \nAttempts to reduce costs and customer wait times have resulted in the use of automated bots to respond to customer queries which further increase frustration.\nImagine instead a call centre that can take a customer’s mood into consideration. Managing a conversation between a customer upset about an error on an invoice differs from one with a customer thanking the company for a free gift.\nResearch is making a tremendous progress in a new area known as affective computing which seeks to bring together computational technology and human emotions. Efforts include finding ways to forecast a user’s mood (happiness, anger, depression, etc.) and enabling robots and computers to modulate their responses based upon the emotional input received.\nThe joint IEC and ISO technical subcommittee that provides standardization in the field of user system interfaces (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35) has recently set up a new working group on affective computing. Affective computing can allow for chatbots and virtual assistants that have enhanced empathy, greater interaction and the ability to transform emotions into data.\nChallenges in collecting data\nOne issue that needs to be addressed is the collection of the data that will be needed to train algorithms in affective computing. Much data will be needed but it must be collected in an ethical manner.\nAccording to Khalid Choukri, the Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35, “we need to be ethical in the way we process data. Whatever decision made by the system must be explainable. We need to include trustworthiness in our systems”.\nThe SC 35 working group is currently examining emotional characteristics and specifically how data is gathered and identified. This work is expected to take several years. As Choukri notes, “there is a lot of research in affective computing but also a lot of controversy on issues like what kinds of emotions we can identify in human interaction. It is a very challenging project”.\nFurther challenges include the diversity of affective characteristics and the way to interpret and reply to these characteristics.\nSC 35 is currently in the final stages of developing the first part of a standard, ISO/IEC 30150, on the user interface for affective computing. This first part provides a model for affective computing user interfaces and areas where further standardization will be needed. While it does not specify the implementation of affective computing, it is intended for developers of systems that want to meet the needs of diverse users.\nThe full article is available in e-tech"

        "content": "Among the IEC most cutting-edge standards, the IEC 61850 series paves the way for the use of a variety of digital technologies relating to smart energy. They are widely considered to be among the core international standards for the smart grid.\nThey deal with key topics such as the integration of renewable energies and distributed energy resources (DERs) within the existing electrical network.\nBecause their content is used by electrical utilities the world over, they are also developed in a very forward-looking way, involving user feedback before the documents are published.\nLaurent Guise heads one of the key working groups inside IEC Technical Committee 57, which prepares the standards. “The IEC 61850 documents are quite unusual compared to many other IEC Standards in that they are first and foremost developed for machines,” he explains.\n“The main user of these standards will not be a person but a computer and they have to be machine-readable. At the same time, they are very complex documents involving thousands of different items.\n“One of the main dilemmas is to avoid any form of ambiguity because machines hate that!  And it’s very difficult to do when you have so many different items to deal with”.\nInvolving pilot projects\nTo reduce the risk of ambiguity, and therefore of errors, IEC TC 57 offers the possibility to the various stakeholders involved to use the draft standards during the drafting process, together with code components/machine readable files, free of charge, for research projects typically. This procedure has been agreed with the IEC sales department.\n“This is a flexible and extremely reactive way of working which enables us to stay ahead of technology developments,” says Guise. “We make the standards available at draft level and we encourage their use in pilot and demonstration projects.\n“The feedback from these users is invaluable and enables us to greatly reduce the potential for mistakes as well as anticipate requirements. It also stops us from publishing endless amendments and corrections to existing standards”.\nTC 57 has also introduced transitional stages (published as technical reports) for most of the new parts of the IEC 61850 series, bundled with associated code components.\nThe aim is to reduce possible remaining miss-matches between market requirements and the content of the proposed standards. This introduces a second opportunity to gather user feedback in a flexible way.\nLastly, light code components are available as a free download for market stakeholders involved in the supply chain of the products and systems involved. These are posted on the IEC website on the “TC57 Supporting Documents” area, attached to specific licensing conditions.\n“There are still potential interoperability issues because so many different stakeholders are involved in the supply chain. That’s why these documents are available for free,” Guise adds.\nThe full series of IEC 61850 Standards is now available as a global package, released in February. They are issued with the available associated code components.\nThe series includes no less than 35 documents, dealing with substation automation, DER integration or cyber security, to name but a few."

        "content": "The WHO has emphasized the essential role of testing as governments develop strategies for lifting the measures currently in place to contain the spread of COVID-19. For example, governments could decide to relax lockdown rules, if testing reveals that large numbers of people have already been infected. \nTesting can tell us how far the virus has spread and help to avoid situations where people, including doctors and nurses, are self-isolating for no reason.\nThere are currently two kinds of test. The first is for detecting the virus and the second for determining whether a patient has already been exposed to the virus and therefore developed antibodies.\nBefore any testing takes place, however, the authorities need to be sure that the tests are safe and perform as intended. The test performance criteria are based on the principles of good practice identified in ISO/IEC 17025 and other international standards.\nISO/IEC 17025 is the international reference for testing and calibration laboratories around the world. It describes the requirements a laboratory must meet to demonstrate that it is able to generate trustworthy results.\nThe process ensures that a laboratory’s quality management system is thoroughly evaluated on a regular basis to guarantee continued technical competence and compliance with the standard.\nISO/IEC 17025 has five sections: \n\nGeneral requirements\n\tLaboratories have to commit to impartiality and confidentiality in their activities.\n\t \nStructural requirements\n\tThe laboratory is a legal entity that is legally responsible for its activities. As such, the laboratory must, among other things, identify management that has overall responsibility, define its organizational  and management structure, the range of its activities, document its procedures and specify the role of anyone managing, performing or verifying work affecting the results of the laboratory. \n\t \nResource requirements\n\tThis section describes key aspects, including all processes and procedures, related to personnel, facilities and environment, equipment, metrological traceability, as well as products and services provided by third parties. \n\t \nProcess requirements\n\tProcess requirements address the review of requests, tenders and contracts, the selection, verification and validation of methods, sampling, the handling of tests or calibration items, technical records, the evaluation of measurement uncertainty, ensuring the validity of results, reporting of results, complaints, nonconforming work and the control of data and information management. \n\t \nManagement requirements\n\tAn important focus of this section are the risks and opportunities associated with the laboratory activities. Addressing risks can include “identifying and avoiding threats, taking risk to pursue an opportunity, eliminating the risk source, changing the likelihood or consequences, sharing the risk or retaining risk by informed decision”. Opportunities can “lead to expanding the scope of the laboratory activities, addressing new customers, using new technology and other possibilities to address customer needs”.\n\n \nISO/IEC 17025 enables laboratories to demonstrate that they are technically proficient and able to produce accurate test and calibration data. Unreliable testing could feed into a second wave of infections.\nThe standard encourages cooperation between laboratories and other bodies by generating wider acceptance of results between countries. This makes it possible for laboratories in different countries to exchange data and to work together to gain a deeper understanding of COVID-19.\nAs well as facilitating trade, having test reports and certificates issued in one country accepted and recognized in many others, without the need for further testing, saves precious time."

        "content": "Halogens are generally considered to be any of the group of five chemical elements of the periodic table consisting of fluorine (F), chlorine (CI), bromine (Br), iodine (I) and astatine (At). They are widespread and abundant in chemical compounds.\nModern utilization of halogens is extensive. They are used in swimming pools (chlorine and bromine), drinking water (chlorine and fluorine), toothpaste (fluorine) as well as in table salt (chlorine).\nHalogens are also used widely in electrical and electronic products, from printed circuit boards, components such as connectors, ion batteries, electrical cables to the plastic cases around television sets and mobile telephones.\nThe widespread use of halogens in electrical and electronic products can be attributed to three factors: their performance properties, relative low cost and abundance of the raw material. Most notably, halogens are used as flame retardants since some halogen-derived compounds provide extremely high resistance to heat which can limit combustion in a fire.\nWhile halogens can provide many benefits, they are also associated with risk. Halogen compounds, if ignited in a fire, release corrosive and toxic gases.\nRole of standards\nIn Europe, some halogenated compounds have been restricted because of their high toxicity. In 2018, IEC issued a new edition of IEC 62474 on hazardous materials reporting. As part of this standard, IEC maintains a database of relevant regulations related to halogen substances in electrical and electronic products.\nIn addition, a number of IEC technical committees have developed standards that include criteria to limit the amount of halogens in applications where safety in case of fire needs to be safeguarded, such as with electric cables.\nManufacturers have also begun to address concerns with certain halogen substances by developing products with limited halogen content. However, the terms employed to describe the halogen content are not standardized and can often have different meanings depending on the manufacturer, the industry or the products for which the material is being used.\nImportance of standardizing terminology\nIEC, along with other standards development organizations and environmental performance programmes, is developing standards for the quantification of halogen content in products.\nHowever, inconsistencies exist in the terminology used as well as in the test methods and requirements. Different terms like halogen free, non-halogenated, zero halogen and low halogen are sometimes used to express similar halogen content. Different limits for halogens are sometimes used despite applying the same term. In some cases, similar terms are used when referring to different halogen types.\nGuidance is needed in order for the terminology used for halogen-related provisions to be uniform and clear. Careful consideration is also needed when selecting test methodology to determine halogen content. As a result, the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Affairs (ACEA) is developing a Guide for standards developers on this topic."

Big data revolutionizes IT systems to efficiently address the needs of the application domain by considering the characteristics of the data being processed. The Big Data Reference Architecture (BDRA) international standard and its companion series will accelerate the adoption of this enabling technology by providing an architectural framework and common language for the various stakeholders”, says Wael William Diab, who leads the standardization work.\nSpeaking a common language\nDevelopers will be able to use the standard which provides an architecture framework for describing the big data components, processes, and systems to establish a common language for the various stakeholders.

        "content": "One of the key public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has been to make people work from home, when possible. Some analysts now believe there may be a permanent shift to teleworking as organizations realize that most office tasks can be done just as efficiently from laptops in living-rooms or kitchens.\nWhether it is writing reports, sharing spreadsheets or exchanging messages, the combination of the internet and electricity makes the transition from office to home almost seamless. There is, however, one exception: it is generally accepted that video conferencing software is not a sustainable long-term alternative to face-to-face meetings.\nIEC experts and staff, like those in many other organizations, have been relying on video conferencing software to remain connected and operational. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to stay focused, people sometimes speak over each other or forget to mute their microphones.\nSome are wondering whether virtual reality (VR) could provide a better solution for meetings. After all, VR can make people feel as though they are in the same place together.\nProponents for holding meetings in virtual conference rooms say it will increase both engagement and productivity. For one thing, there are fewer distractions.\n \nVR applications rely on such components as screens, processors, motion sensors, gyroscopes, and cameras. These in turn link to the headsets, the high cost of which is one of the few drawbacks.\nA number of IEC technical committees (TCs) and their subcommittees (SCs) produce International Standards and have testing systems which help ensure the reliability, safety, efficiency, interoperability and quality of the components within this technology.\nISO/IEC JTC 1, the Joint Technical Committee of IEC and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), covers standardization for information technology. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 works on interfaces for information technology-based applications relating to computer graphics and virtual reality, image processing, environmental data representation, support for mixed and augmented reality, interaction with, and visual presentation of information.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 covers coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information. It has published International Standard ISO/IEC 23000–13, which focuses on the data formats used to provide an AR presentation using 2D/3D multimedia content.\nSensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are vital to VR. IEC TC 47 and IEC SC 47F ensure they are reliable and efficient.\nIEC TC 100 produces Standards which contribute to the quality and performance of audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment and their interoperability with other systems, while IEC TC 110 covers electronic display devices and certain components, such as dashboard touchscreens in cars."

        "content": "With the spread of the coronavirus and the constraints it has generated, innovative solutions using technologies have been introduced. Drones are one example of a technology that has provided services when physical distancing has become the norm.\nDelivering medical supplies\nAccording to reports, drones have been effectively used in China to help deliver 11 tons of medical supplies to areas stricken with COVID-19 and brought testing samples to laboratories. By using drones, the delivery time decreased by over 50% compared with road transportation and limited the number of people involved in the delivery process, thus reducing unnecessary human contact.\nIt is conceivable that in the future, drones could also be used to help deliver consumer goods to households.\nEnforcing physical distancing policies\nSeveral news outlets have reported on the use of drones to remind people to respect physical distancing policies. Police officers in Spain have used drones to discipline groups congregated in parks.\nA similar approach has been used in France where police orders enforcing lockdown have been made via drones. In the United States, drones have been flying over some residential areas to remind people to go home and not congregate in groups.\nDisinfecting public spaces\nOne company in China, XAG, has deployed its drone technology to help contain the coronavirus. Over 2 600 XAG drones have disinfected an area covering 902 million square metres in China.\nAccording to XAG, drones can cover a much wider area and have the ability to precisely control output compared with manual labour. It estimates that one drone can disinfect 600 000 – 700 000 square metres, which would require 100 workers to complete, and consumes one fifth less disinfectant compared with handheld spraying.\nRole of IEC Standards\nAlso known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unpiloted air systems (UAS), drones can be operated autonomously through on-board computers or by remote control. They are generally powered by an internal combustion engine, batteries, or a solar photovoltaic (PV) system or a combination of these.\nAs well as flight controllers and electronic speed controllers, equipment common to drones includes an internal global positioning system (GPS) module which tells the aircraft where it is and where the cameras are looking at all times, and a microcontroller (MCU) to allow the data coming from various connected sensors to be processed in real time. On‑board datalink communications allow navigation, piloting and camera operation instructions to be sent to the drone and positional and live video streams to be downlinked from its camera systems.\nIEC Standards cover the vast majority of the components used in drones, such as GPS units, wireless transmitters, signal processors, batteries, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other sensors. In addition, several working groups on drone technology have been set up by the joint IEC and ISO technical committee on information technology (ISO/IEC JTC 1)."

        "content": "The merging of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with IoT systems is already impacting businesses and consumers, securing huge benefits for all. IEC International Standards help to overcome some of the unavoidable flaws.\nAI-enabled IoT systems already enable businesses to better monitor the supply and demand chain and deliver goods, with less human intervention, which in turn generates cost-savings. Such systems detect safety issues in smart manufacturing plants and are increasingly expected to automatically deal with them.\nCalled the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), these systems not only enable plant managers to identify faults that may not have come to light, they also save precious time – a bonus for employees and workers, as well as customers.\nIn the home, these intelligent systems will be expected to enable consumer connected devices to not only notify the owner or ring alarms, say when a fire starts in the oven, for instance, as most smart systems already do, but also shut off the oven, the whole power system in the home and call the fire brigade.\nUsing powerful algorithms and machine learning software, the Intelligence of Things will allow a multitude of areas and businesses to not only detect problems but act on them and solve them with minimal human intervention.\nQuality over quantity\nOne of the drawbacks of these new systems is that machine learning is only as good as the data provided. IEC and ISO together develop international standards for information technologies through a joint technical committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1). “It’s the rubbish in/rubbish out quandary.\nIf you feed a learning system data that is corrupt you will not have a good result no matter how powerful the algorithms are. But that is where performance standards can help, by enabling users to monitor the quality of the data, for instance”, explains François Coallier, who chairs one of the subcommittees of JTC 1 which prepares standards for the IoT.\nIt publishes several key documents that help to standardize the industries impacted by the IoT and the intelligence of things. For instance, ISO/IEC 30141 provides a global reference architecture and common vocabulary for the IoT.\nAlgorithms can be biased\nAlgorithms are only as good as their developers. Machine learning can reproduce sexist and racist bias from the real world. Examples include image recognition software that fails to identify non-white faces correctly. This occurs when the scientists who develop the algorithms unwittingly introduce their own prejudices into their work.\nBiases can influence the way a medical sample is collected by not including some members of the intended statistical population, for example. This could result in building an algorithm used for medical diagnosis, trained only on data from one subset of the population.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 is addressing many of these concerns. It is looking into a wide range of issues related to trustworthiness as well as robustness, resiliency, reliability, accuracy, safety, security and privacy within the context of AI.\nRead more in The Intelligence of Things."

        "content": "Circular economies can be described as a systemic approach to the design of process, products and business models in order to enable sustainable economic growth through the effective management of resources. \nThis is made possible through a circular flow of materials as well as reducing, and ultimately eliminating, waste.\nPutting in place a circular economy will be fundamental to deliver the decoupling economic growth from current environmental degradation while also promoting good health and well-being. The circular economy is based on the principles of reducing and eliminating waste by, for example, intelligent designs. It is about keeping products and materials in use and it is about the regeneration of natural resources. The ultimate objective of a circular economy is achieving sustainable economic growth.\nThe United Nations has made a similar appeal for sustainable economic growth through its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals, at the core of its blueprint for building a better world by 2030 call for sustainable development through the harmonization of three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection.\nSDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) resonate strongly with the work of the IEC in promoting a circular economy. In order to achieve economic growth and sustainable development, we must reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources as well as the way we use resources to produce energy.\nUnderstanding resource efficiency\nResource efficiency, a core tenet of a circular economy, expresses how natural resources can be used to deliver sustainable development while minimizing environmental impact. While the focus for many years has been on improving the energy efficiency of electrical and electronic equipment, now increased attention is given to material usage and its preservation.\nMaterial Efficiency expresses how efficiently materials can be used to deliver a good or service and the extent to which they can be kept in use and not discarded. If after their use, products are incinerated or discarded into a landfill, there is a significant loss of value associated with that material. The ultimate objective of material efficiency is to keep materials in use “forever”, either through lifetime extension strategies or recycling.\nStrategies associated with longer product lifetimes while using fewer natural resources include designing products that last much longer than they do today while using fewer resources, ensuring that products can be reused, repaired, upgrade, refurbished, and remanufactured, and finally, the materials recycled. However, there is significant loss in the value of a product when it is put in the waste stream. For this reason, product and component recycling should be a last resort after applying lifetime extension strategies.\nStandards can help\nIEC has published a number of standards that support material efficiency. For example, IEC 62309 examines the dependability of products containing used parts and IEC 63077 which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment. Standards currently under development address product circularity in the design of products and the refurbishment of medical equipment and rotating machinery.\nNew standards will also be needed in order to ensure product safety, performance and reliability for refurbished and remanufactured products and issues such as data removal and security will need to be considered as products are reused and change ownership. As we move towards a circular economy, standards have a vital role to ensuring sustainable economic development.\nIn the future, we will also need standardized methods and tools to assess aspects such as the proportion of reused components or recycled content in products, or how to assess the ease or difficulty to repair or remanufacture a product."

        "content": "Facial recognition is a biometric artificial intelligence (AI) application, which starts with a photograph of a face. Next, a face recognition algorithm extracts identity-related features, which can then be matched against features previously extracted from other images.\nThis technology is being used in an ever-increasing array of applications. For example, it can be integrated into devices and objects to enable them to be unlocked, such as smartphones or allow secure access. Many airports deploy it at automated e-gates for passport control, to verify the traveller’s identity against the data stored in the chip in their biometric passport.\nBusinesses are looking at facilitating payments using this technology. All customers have to do is open the app and confirm payment using their camera.\nIn the future, it could be used to make online payments, get into cars, houses and other buildings, secure access to health or other sensitive data.\nHow a standard will help\nWhile there are many benefits to using this technology, it still makes mistakes. Facial recognition can fail to match a known user. The photo may not a be good enough quality, or the person in the image may be looking down or making an unusual expression.\nIEC and ISO together develop international standards for ICT, including biometrics.\n“The new ISO/IEC 24358 standard aims to minimize facial recognition errors by defining a new generation of cameras that understand the image they’re trying to collect. The current situation is that often generic “dumb” cameras are used that naively accept poorly presented images”, says Patrick J. Grother, who leads development of the new standard.\nThe standard specifies properties of next-generation biometric face capture subsystems intended to improve the suitability of photographs for automated face recognition, reduce the variability in those photographs, improve support for human face identification, and impede tampering and illicit modification of photographs.\n“The standard includes specifications for new functionalities for face image capture subsystems that target the quality of images. Its primary role is in collection of pristine face images from cooperating subjects that are suited to reside in an authoritative enrolment database. Additionally, it addresses other issues, for example, it adds support for forensic human adjudication; it formalizes compression; includes protection against image manipulation and tampering; merges printing processes”, says Grother.\nFor more about the technical and human error issues in facial recognition systems, read the full e-tech interview."

        "content": "A recent article in Science Robotics suggests that robots could be effective resources in combating COVID-19. Robots can be deployed for disinfection, they are also able to deliver medicine and food, measure vital signs, etc.\nWhile more complicated therapeutic acts, which require judgment and compassion, might not be appropriate, the truth is that the vast majority of medical-related tasks could be accomplished by robots.\nMore broadly, as workers in factories around the world stay at home, scared of contracting the virus, many manufacturers out there have probably contemplated moving their production lines to full automation. Farmers could use robotic help in their fields or in their greenhouses as the pool of temp workers dries up.\nWhile the pandemic brings the need for robots into sharp focus, it is only accelerating a trend that is already impacting low income jobs, more especially in developed countries. Automatic payment counters have become standard in most shops and supermarkets and people use them without any afterthought.\nRobots are ubiquitous in online shopping warehouses, are already used for cleaning and for some agricultural tasks and are even commonplace in fast food restaurants. And the list could go on…\nRobots are increasingly expected to do dull, dirty and dangerous work and Covid-19 has put their usefulness under the spotlight. The other side of the coin is unavoidably less jobs for a wide number of people.\nOne could make an analogy with confinement during the Covid crisis: it may protect workers’ health but at the same time it takes away their livelihood. More qualified jobs are not protected either. Robots can write articles and meet deadlines without fail; They even compete with artists.\nIEC is a founding member of the Open Community for Ethics in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (OCEANIS). This global forum brings together organizations interested in the development and use of standards as means to address ethical matters in autonomous and intelligent systems.\nWhile the issue of biased algorithms is often mentioned on the “ethics” agenda, an even more important one is probably what kind of future do we want. Will work still be at the core of what defines human beings in tomorrow’s societies?\nA question that Karl Marx tried to answer in the 19th century but which is again at the centre of today’s zeitgeist – in part thanks to the Corona Virus."

        "content": "With the current coronavirus pandemic, certain medical supplies are in urgent need. Medical staff require personal protective equipment, nasal swabs are needed to conduct testing and a sufficient number of respiratory ventilators are lacking.\nBecause of the constrains on the supply chain, with many of the manufacturing areas located in China already badly affected by the pandemic, new digital manufacturing companies are emerging to fill the supply gaps. Using 3D printers, these manufacturers are developing medical masks and face shields, nasal swabs as well as components for ventilators.\nIn anticipation of the 3D printing of components and accessories, the European Commission has published a statement on the conformity assessment procedures for 3D printing to be used in the for medical devices needed to fight COVID-19. This statement lists a number of standards relevant for 3D printing including IEC Standards on the safety of machinery and the safety of laser products.\nOther groups, such as the joint IEC and ISO technical subcommittee on office equipment (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 28), also develops standards for 3D printers.\nExamples of 3D printing in action\nThere are a number of examples of how 3D printing has been used to make devices that are urgently needed right now. They include:\n\nA team at Northwell Health has made available a template for 3D printed nasal swabs. Already, one manufacturer has plans to use its 3D printers to produce 100 000 nasal swabs each day.\nA global printing manufacturer has announced that it has delivered more than 1 000 3D-printed face masks, face shields, mask adjusters, nasal swabs and respirator parts to local hospitals in Spain and the United States. Plans are also underway to develop hospital-grade face masks and parts for a mechanical bag valve mask.\nNagami Design in Spain has converted the use of its robotic arm from making furniture to 3D printed face shields with a production of up to 500 shields each day.\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota and MIT are each working on the design for low-cost ventilators that hospitals could produce in case of an emergency shortage.\nAccording to media reports, 3D printers have been brought into a hospital in Italy to design and produce venturi valves needed in the intensive care unit.\nA small company in the United States is providing face shields to local health workers based on a printing template that it has developed and shared. Similarly, researchers at Northwestern University have generated 1 000 face shields in one day from a single 3D printer.\n\n \nAs noted by the founders of Nagami Design, “3D printing has emerged as the ultimate tool for local manufacturing, reducing the production chain to the bare minimum. With the COVID-19 emergency, this technology provides the opportunity to efficiently produce affordable tools, which are now essential to help save lives”.\nHowever, the use of these new tools should only be seen as a stop-gap measure necessary in an emergency.\nAuthorities voice caution\nAs per the statement from the European Commission, authorities need to ensure that medical devices conform to regulations, including those produced by 3D printers. For low risk medical devices, manufacturers can issue their declaration of conformity.\nIn the United States, the FDA has expressed some reservations whether 3D printed products, such as personal protective equipment, can provide the same level of protection as conventional products. Risks emerge when products are made outside of the traditional regulatory regime.\nIt will be necessary to trust that digital manufacturers have undertaken the proper design and testing measures to ensure that their products work effectively and safety. Standards can provide the necessary safeguards and ensure performance, safety and reliability."

        "content": "The website of the WHO offers a number of recommendations for minimizing the spread of COVID-19, including the importance of washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. If you use your mobile phone to check the latest health advice, however, you may be at risk of transferring viruses and bacteria back to your hands.\nKeeping your phone sanitized is therefore a very good idea. How you wash your phone will depend on how resistant it is to moisture.\nAlthough probably not advisable, some phones may even survive a gentle washing in soap and water. But how do you know if your phone is waterproof?\nThe IEC has developed, and continually updates the international standard, IEC 60529, to rate the resistance of phones and other mobile devices against the intrusion of liquids and dust. The standard, prepared by Technical Committee 70, rates the degrees of protection offered by the phone’s enclosure using the IP Code.\nIt also defines the tests to be performed to verify that the enclosure meets the requirements of the standard.\nFor example, two of the flagship phones currently on sale are rated as splash, water, and dust resistant to IP67 and IP 68 respectively. The first digit following the IP shows the phone’s resistance to dust and the second to water.\nThey both get sixes, which is the top score, indicating no ingress of dust.\nWhen it comes to water resistance, the scale runs from zero (no protection) to nine (high-pressure hot water from different angles). Both the flagship phones are water resistant, but there is a significant difference between achieving a seven or an eight rating.\nIt is important to note that the IP rating is an indication of how the device was tested, not the conditions in which it can be used. According to Axel Klingberg, convenor of the maintenance team for IEC 60529, “this world-wide agreed (upon) standard is only describing the way to test products — not more, not less. A few drops of water inside can be very dangerous in one product, but not another.”\nStandards and conformity assessment\nThe IEC provides international standards and conformity assessment for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. IEC conformity assessment verifies that standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems to guarantee safety and quality, in this way adding value to products and services.\nThis may mean using different kinds of conformity assessment—ranging from corporate self-assessment to relying on supplier’s declarations to independent, third-party assessment and testing—whichever are most appropriate according to the different levels of risk.\nCleaning your phone\nAs for how best to clean your phone, a major news organization asked Dr Lena Ciric, a microbiologist, for her advice:"

        "content": "Coronavirus is continuing to spread around the world with at least 170 countries already affected. Our response to the pandemic is changing demand and consumption patterns for electricity as industrial activity slows and an increasing number of office staff are encouraged to telework.\nIt is electricity that is allowing us to work from home. The internet, email, videoconferencing and all the other tools we take for granted would not be possible without it.\nElectricity plays an indispensable role in our daily lives, from lighting rooms and making refrigerators and stoves work to providing the power for us to shop online or send text messages. As the emergency takes grip, electricity is needed to keep ventilators and other medical devices in the hospitals running. IEC Standards ensure they function as expected and safely.\nElectricity underpins modern communications. It ensures, for example, that public service radio and television can continue to deliver the latest news and information about the pandemic to concerned citizens. \nKeeping the electric grid running through the emergency is a top priority everywhere. IEC helps keep the power on.\nIEC work provides the technical foundation for everything that uses electricity or contains electronics, including energy generation, transmission and its use in billions of devices and systems.\nInternational standards enable the efficient and smart use of electrical energy. IEC Technical Committees publish documents that ensure electrical energy is produced, transported and consumed safely and, increasingly, in an energy efficient and sustainable way. \nIEC technical committees have also been developing international standards for the safety and performance of electrical equipment used in medical practice for more than 50 years. A number of TCs carry out work covering both medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems.\nIEC conformity assessment ensures that standards are properly implemented. Peer testing and certification confirms that systems and devices meet expectations in terms of compliance with identified IEC standards.\nOf course, electricity should not be taken for granted. IEC is acutely aware that hundreds of millions of people in developing countries do not have access to the benefits of modern life. It is one of our most pressing challenges.\nOur doctors and scientists will help us to pull through the coronavirus pandemic. But we will still face the challenge of mitigating the effects of climate change and building a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren."

        "content": "Millions of people around the world are working from home, many of them for the first time, as more and more countries go into lockdown over COVID-19. But as remote working increases, so too does the security risk to sensitive data, systems and networks.\nMany home networks lack security measures such as antivirus software, customized firewall and online backup tools. This increases the risk of malware finding its way onto devices and into corporate infrastructure.\nAlready cyber criminals are preying on people’s concerns about the spread of COVID-19. Organizations as diverse as the WHO and the FBI have issued warnings and tips in recent days about a spate of phishing emails claiming to be from health officials.\nMany of these attacks rely on the mistakes and carelessness of those they target. That’s why the least affected organizations are likely to be those with a strong cyber security culture, where all staff play a clearly defined part in protecting critical data and networks.\nIn one scam, emails pretending to be from the director of the WHO are encouraging receivers to click on a link in order to access essential information about COVID-19. In another scam, fake apps, when downloaded, are enabling criminals to spy on victims through phone cameras and microphones, as well as read text messages.\nThere is a lot of good advice online about the cyber security measures that need to be taken to protect staff and corporate assets. For example, Cyber security is essential when preparing for COVID-19 comes from the Australian authorities.\nAt the very least, organizations should be reminding staff to stay vigilant and to avoid opening or clicking on anything that looks suspicious. Preferably, it should be part of an ongoing cyber security communication strategy that regularly reminds employees about basic precautions and security policies, as recommended in ISO/IEC 27001.\nThis standard advises giving all employees awareness education and training about their organization’s information management security policy. The ISMS requirements described in ISO/IEC 27001 define a cyber risk management-based approach to managing people, processes, services and technology. \nUsing ISO/IEC 27001, helps organizations to manage their information security risks, including threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, as well as designing controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and for regulating access to critical information systems and networks. It also emphasizes the importance of the ISO/IEC 27001 risk management process taking account of legal, regulatory and contractual requirements."

        "content": "One of the bread and butter objectives of IEC standardization is helping the electrotechnical industries to deal with electro magnetic (EM) interference and to build electro magnetic compatibility (EMC) into various electrical and electronic (EE) devices. One of the key IEC technical committees which prepares standards in that area recently gave a strategy presentation, which was approved by the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB).\nThere are so many different causes of EM interference: lighting, for instance, can damage and stop some electrical and electronic equipment from functioning. We also use EM emissions on a daily basis to communicate (mobile phones) or to perform a number of mundane tasks, such as heating food up in a microwave. These emissions can produce radio frequency fields that can affect radio reception. This is the reason why people are asked to shut down their mobile phones during take off and landing on an aeroplane, for instance.\nA crucial task for IEC is to prepare appropriate and standardized requirements and test methods in order to reduce EM emissions to an acceptable level and ensure sufficient EM immunity for EE devices and systems. Several IEC committees and groups prepare standards relating to EMC, but two specific ones are dedicated to overall EMC safety and performance testing.\nRoles and responsibilities\nIEC TC 77 deals with requirements for low frequency EM emissions (below 9 KhZ) and low and high frequency EM immunity. Another group, the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR), is responsible for radio frequency emissions which are above 9 KhZ, focusing on radio interference protection.\nCISPR is composed of the participating National Committees of the IEC and a number of International Organizations including CIGRE (International Council on Large Electric Systems), EBU (European Broadcasting Union) and ITU (International Telecommunication Union).\nFuture standardization plans\nNew technologies are having an impact on EMC standardization because they affect the EM environment.\nOne of these technology trends is the augmenting use of power technology and microelectronics with increasing operating frequencies. Another is the gradual implementation of smart grids and accompanying communication and information exchange. Yet another is the use of higher frequencies, for instance 5G, as well as the emergence of inductive charging for e-cars.\nTC 77 therefore has decided to develop standards relating to the EMC impact of these new technologies. In the first instance, one of its subcommittees, IEC TC 77 B, has been tasked with producing a test standard concerning the immunity against broadband radio-frequency fields. This concerns 5G, in particular.\nTo find out more about the IEC and 5G, read Measuring human exposure to 5G."

The finding comes in the ICNIRP’s updated guidelines for protection against harmful effects of radiofrequency fields\n“We know parts of the community are concerned about the safety of 5G and we hope the updated guidelines will help put people at ease,” said Dr Eric van Rongen, the ICNIRP chair.\n“The guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process. They provide protection against all scientifically substantiated adverse health effects due to [electromagnetic field] exposure in the 100 kHz to 300 GHz range.”\nThe new ICNIRP guidelines follow the publication last year of an IEC Technical Report (TR) on evaluating human exposure to radio frequency fields in the vicinity of base stations, including 5G base stations and small cells. The TR illustrates the latest testing methods for 5G with worked examples on trial sites.\nThe report is the work of IEC Technical Committee 106, which prepares International Standards on measurement and calculation methods to assess human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. TC 106 brings together global experts from mobile operators, mobile manufacturers, academia, government regulators and testing laboratories.\n“As 5G advances at a rapid rate and networks are deployed, testing base stations to ensure they meet the radio frequency (RF) exposure standards is an essential step for operators, regulators and the community, providing a reassurance on safety,” said TC 106 chair Mike Wood.\n5G is set to revolutionise wireless communications and play a major role in our future connected society and facilitate the road towards a more advanced Internet of Things (IoT). The technology promises not only to increase downloading and uploading speeds over the mobile network, but also to add significant capacity and reduce latency (the time taken by networks to respond)."

According to Wikipedia, BeiDou-3, the third generation of the Chinese satnav system, is expected to consist of 35 satellites and completion is planned for the first half of 2020. \nIt will provide an alternative to the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian GLONASS or European Galileo systems. BDS is also known as the Compass Navigation Satellite System. According to specialized press reports, BeiDou will deliver two types of services: a free service that is open for everyone with a compatible terminal and a licensed service for the Chinese government to use in military and other areas.\nThe IEC Standard, IEC 61108-5, was published on March 11, 2020. This receiver standard applies to navigation in the ocean, coastal, harbour entrances, harbour approaches and restricted waters, as defined in International Maritime Organization (IMO) resolution 22 and 27.\nIEC 61108-5 specifies the minimum performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results for BDS ship-borne receiver equipment. The document is associated with several other standards issued by IEC Technical Committee 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunications equipment and systems, notably for Galileo GLONASS and GPS receiver systems.\nIEC 61108-5 will notably help manufacturers of BDS-related maritime devices to design, produce, and test their products. “I would like to thank the project leader for this standard, Mrs Yang Wenhui of the Xi’an Research Institute of Navigation Technology, who put considerable effort into the project,” says Kim Fisher, IEC TC 80 Secretary.\nTwo new categories of requirements have been added, which are not included, notably in the previous IEC Standards for Galileo and GPS receiver systems. The first set of requirements concerns the presentation of navigation-related information, including positioning accuracy, capture time and sensitivity, in order to reflect the performance of the BDS; Other specifications have to do with new contents such as ship bridge alarm management, in compliance with new IMO guidelines.\nFind out more about IEC standards for the maritime industry"

        "content": "Advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, could help to provide solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using AI tools such as machine learning and data analytics, researchers can help to track outbreaks, detect illness and eventually secure a treatment.\nHowever, putting in place the systems to do so will require time and may be more useful should another pandemic strike.\nTracking the outbreak\nThe Canadian AI company BlueDot reportedly noticed an unusual number of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. The company, which tracks outbreaks of infectious diseases, alerted its clients to the activity nine days before the World Health Organization officially flagged COVID-19. Using data analytics, BlueDot seeks to track, contextualize, and anticipate infectious disease risks.\nSimilarly, other companies such as HealthMap at Boston Children’s Hospital and Metabiota in San Francisco also reported finding early signs of the outbreak. Metabiota has also proved adept at predicting the infection rate of the virus. In late February, it estimated that 127,000 people around the world would be infected by early March; this was only 30,000 more than the actual figure and remains within the margin of error.\nHowever, as the pandemic spreads, reliable data will be more difficult to access thus making the predictions less accurate. News sources and official reports may offer inconsistent accounts, confusion will likely spread and data noise will be on the rise.\nDetecting the illness\nSome have claimed that AI could be used to provide early diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients. Artificial intelligence has been used successfully to examine medical images and catch early signs of breast cancer, and some researchers have suggested that machine learning could be used to detect COVID-19 in CT scans of lung tissue.\nHowever, it is not clear whether sufficient data exists to train the AI models. In addition, the signs of the virus in the lungs may only be noticeable long after the initial infection and thus not applicable for an early diagnosis.\nAnother company, Infervision, has developed software which detects visual signs of the pneumonia. It has been used in several hospitals in China to help hospital staff prioritize patients.\nSecuring treatment\nData is essential to find a treatment for the COVID-19 virus. For example, AI can be used to sift through existing drugs to see if they can be repurposed for the current virus.\nAI could also be used to determine all of the possible evolution paths of the virus. Adding information about a possible vaccine could also help researchers better understand what would – or would not – work.\nResearch is also underway to understand the structure of the virus in order to create a vaccine. Because COVID-19 is a type of coronavirus that contains a single-strand RNA structure which allows it to mutate rapidly, the Chinese company Baidu has shared its Linearfold algorithm which can be used to predict the virus’s secondary RNA structure.\nSuch work, however, will require significant time. It is not expected that a vaccine will be developed for another 18 months.\nWork in standardization\nThe IEC and ISO are developing international standards on AI through a joint committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42) which is considering the entire AI ecosystem.\nThe SC 42 portfolio of deliverables covers foundational aspects such as a framework for AI using machine learning, standards lifecycle and terminology that enables the diverse stakeholders to engage and interact. These are in addition to horizontal deliverables such as data aspects, trustworthiness, computational methods, governance implications of AI, use cases and applications of AI."

        "content": "The circular economy calls for a paradigm shift in production and consumption across society. Continual cycles recover and restore products, components and materials through strategies such as reuse, repair, remanufacture and, ultimately, recycling.\nIt is a systemic approach to managing resources, which impacts all participants in the product value chain: manufacturers and their business models, suppliers, consumers and their behaviour and the waste management industry.\nIndustry is taking note\nMany businesses have understood the importance of the circular economy and taken steps to begin integrating its concepts into their business practices. Andre Nieuwland, who works for a leading health technology company and presented at a recent IEC workshop on the circular ecoomy, remarks, “our company has some quite ambitious goals for 2020 to become more circular-oriented and have more revenues from circular types of services and products.”\nHowever, moving towards a circular economy is not an easy endeavour. It requires a deep reflection on how to implement circularity into business practices. According to Solange Blaszkowski, Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Aspects (ACEA), “when thinking about the circular economy, a lot of people think in terms of incremental improvements. But to really achieve a circular economy, we need to put in place a totally new way of thinking”.\nChristian Dworak, who is involved in the circular economy at the European level, concurs. “The circular economy means rethinking the whole strategy of a company, including sales, marketing and finance. This is a major challenge”.\nFor example, companies need to refocus their business from selling goods to providing services. According to Nieuwland, “our current business system is still quite heavily biased towards selling goods rather than maintaining them. If you look at the biggest challenge for our industry to become more circular, it is that we must change our business models”.\nStandards can help\nStandards can serve as an important tool to promote the circular economy. According to Blaszkowski, “if a company wants to make its business more circular, it will need to reach out to supply chains, users and regulators. For businesses operating internationally, it may also mean reaching out to the value chain spread throughout the whole world. Standards play a very important role in that they create one terminology and the same understanding about what today are seen as difficult concepts in the circular economy”.\nStandards can, for example, provide methods to measure the durability and upgradeability of a product. They can also specify means to assess the ease with which a product can be repaired and recycled, and to ensure the quality of the recycled materials. They can also provide means to assess the degree of circularity of a business, product and/or service\nStandards can help with issues related to international trade and the legal issues associated with the shipment of products across national borders. Manufacturers are confronted with different rules and regulations where it is not always possible to use refurbished components. According to Nieuwland, “we need to find a solution in standardization so that it is possible to sell refurbished systems across borders. It is not waste that we are producing, but rather it is waste that we are trying to prevent by becoming more circular and reusing parts in a smart and efficient way”.\nFor Dworak, “international standards can help give manufacturers the confidence and security that what they do will be recognized worldwide”."

        "content": "IECRE the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, issued 109 wind certificates by the end of 2019.\n“As we all become more acutely aware of the challenges of global climate change, IECRE is delighted to report its 100th wind turbine certificate. This demonstrates the industry’s commitment to safe, efficient devices that have been independently tested and assessed to state of the art criteria, helping to meet our obligations in a business efficient manner”, said Alistair Mackinnon, Chair of IECRE.\nIECRE was developed with the participation of industry players, including equipment manufacturers, power producers, insurance companies, test laboratories and certifying bodies. The System streamlines a complex process and benefits for wind, solar PV and marine energy.\n“As well as providing a common language for very technical products, the extensive industry stakeholder participation in defining the IECRE certification process means that the certificates meet the needs of the broader industry and especially the end users of the certificates.”, said Frank Ormel, IECRE Wind Energy OMC Chair. “We are committed to providing further value to the industry”\nThe IECRE wind sector is fully operational with 9 certification bodies and 29 testing laboratories, authorized to conduct testing and certification of wind turbines, their components and/or wind farms.\nIt issues different types of certificates, for example, a provisional certificate covers the entire wind turbine or plant and means that basic safety requirements have been met, but there may be some outstanding non safety-related issues. This certificate can be used to start serial production, however the final certificate will be needed before turbines/plants can begin working. It also issues certificates for components. The most common certificate is the “type certificate” which certifies that the wind turbine design has met all requirements from the stated standards.\nEveryone benefits – from manufacturers to investors\nFinancial institutions recognize that harmonized standards and certification contribute to a more transparent and efficient certification environment for all stakeholders. IECRE certification de-risks the investments of financial institutions investing in large renewable energy projects at insignificant cost.\n“The IECRE System for certifying wind turbines harmonizes the process so that one certificate is valid for multiple markets. It also enables cost savings. Based on mutual recognition, all stakeholders are ensured that they will receive equipment made to International Standards”, said Wolfram Zeitz, Executive Secretary of the IECRE System.\nPreviously, wind turbines had to be certified in each country by private certification bodies, according to different criteria. This was more costly, time-consuming and required repeat testing. It also took much longer to get product to market.\nAbout IECRE\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, was created in recognition that the ever-increasing demand for electricity and the need to address the specific requirements of the RE sector. The System aims to facilitate international trade in equipment and services for use in RE in the marine, solar PV and wind energy sectors, while maintaining the required level of safety. It will cover products, services and personnel, to provide testing, inspection and certification."

        "content": "Ulrike Haltrich has been appointed Chair of IEC TC 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment, one of the most prolific IEC TCs. IEC TC 100  has published close to 500 standards which shape the audio-visual (AV) as well as the information and communication (ICT) landscape.\nHere is an excerpt of the full interview you can read in Trend setter.\nCan you quickly run us through some of the key achievements of TC 100 to date?\nTC 100 has a great track record in improving people’s quality of life (QOL), with publications in the area of smart television, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and Internet TV receiver specifications, optical cable distribution systems and audio archive systems, to name but a few. The TC has also been involved in the maintenance of Digital Living Network Alliance (DNLA) guidelines in addition to developing the e-book and e-publishing related format as well as the USB and MIDI interface. It also produces tremendous work in multimedia systems and equipment for cars. The TC includes 324 experts and issued 16 publications in 2019 bringing the total to 474. That gives you an idea of the volume and depth of the work we do.\nAs new Chair, where will your priorities lie?\nAlongside continuing to improve people’s QOL, TC 100 has defined some new priorities which relate to making our world a more sustainable place. Environmental aspects will be key. We will be looking at measuring methods for power consumption for AV and ICT equipment, for instance. Energy efficiency and smart grid applications will be part of the mix. Other technical areas that will be prioritized are active assisted living (AAL), and more generally the question of accessibility and usability for AV and multimedia equipment. Next generation audio is also important, as is wireless power transfer.  \nWhich new technologies are expected to have an impact on the standards TC 100 will develop?\nArtificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and cyber security systems are gaining traction in AV and multimedia. There are also demands for standardization relating to new types of user interfaces, such as haptics or vibrotactile multimedia systems. Augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality continue to be hot topics. There are equally many demands for standardization in the area of multimedia systems and equipment for vehicles. We will aim to improve inclusion and sustainability and will specifically focus on the environmental aspects for multimedia systems and equipment."

        "content": "We live in an increasingly digitalized world, with a growing number of intelligent and connected products and services. From smart homes and connected healthcare devices, to cars that are becoming increasingly autonomous, we must put our trust in the technology all around us.\nArtificial intelligence is accelerating the digital transformation a wide variety of use cases and applications that promise to transform our daily lives to the better. Nonetheless, it further brings into focus the need to address trustworthiness, ethical and societal concerns.\nDigital Trust Forum releases initial strategy paper during Bosch ConnectedWorld 2020\nThe Digital Trust Forum (DTF) acknowledges the need for well-defined responsibilities and governance as a foundation for trust in AI and IoT, collectively known as AIoT. A key question it addresses is a strategy of how to enable trust in AIoT-enabled systems by defining quality parameters, fulfilling regulatory and other requirements, defining, maintaining and observing policies, and monitoring compliance.\nMichael Bolle, Bosch group CDO/CTO commented: “Digital Trust is a key enabler for the next step in the evolution of the AIoT. The Digital Trust Forum is paving the way for making intelligent IoT systems trustworthy. The forum is piloting concrete use cases to show how abstract and high-level regulations can be mapped to digital policies for automatic processing, creating a pragmatic way for trust enforcement.”\nDTF released its initial strategy paper during the Bosch ConnectedWorld conference in Berlin on 20 February. The paper offers a pragmatic roadmap for aligning regulatory perspectives, industry views, and offers a strategy built on agile and dynamic ways of how AI and IoT solutions are often created.\nThe role of IEC and ISO International Standards\nIEC and ISO are developing international standards on AI through a joint committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42) which is considering the entire AI ecosystem.\nSC 42 develops horizontal AI standards,  which include a suite of trustworthiness projects such as an overview of the topic, specific aspects related to AI, such as unintended bias and robustness of neural networks, and an AI risk management framework that builds on the generic ISO 31000 risk management standard for AI to address trustworthiness issues. The AI focused 42 trustworthiness standards complement a rich set of hundreds of published standards on information and cyber security, privacy and trustworthiness that have been developed by joint committees of IEC and ISO under the JTC 1 programme.\nAdditionally, SC 42 considers societal concerns and ethical aspects of AI across its entire work programme, such as through use cases and application guidance as well as rough specific projects such as mapping such requirements to the trustworthiness technical work.\nThe SC 42 portfolio of deliverables covers foundational aspects such as a framework for AI using machine learning, standards lifecycle and terminology that enables the diverse stakeholders to engage and interact. These are in addition to horizontal deliverables such as data aspects, trustworthiness, computational methods, governance implications of AI, use cases and applications of AI.\nSC 42 is studying new areas such as a management systems standard (MSS), which if approved to proceed, would enable auditability / certification and AI systems engineering looking at addressing issues with real world development / deployment of trustworthy AI systems\n“Our work is enables strategies such as that of the DTF through the an ecosystem approach that considers all aspects of the technology, it’s context of use as well as concurrently addressing trustworthiness, ethical and societal concerns in lockstep with the technical development,” said Wael William Diab, Chair of SC 42. “SC 42’s broad portfolio of deliverables bridge the gap between contextual requirements such as application domain, regulatory, policy, ethical, societal and business with technical requirements and horizontal standards solutions. This will accelerate the broad adoption of AI applications that are trustworthy.”   \nAbout DTF\nThe Digital Trust Forum is a global, independent initiative. It aims to create an ecosystem of leading industry organizations, to help shape a framework for enabling trust in the digital world of intelligent and connected products, supported by IoT and AI-based systems.\nContributors to the paper include:\nA Di Felice (Digital Europe), A Mitrakas (ENISA), A Nannara (TIOTA), Bassam Zarkout (IIC), C Bonefeld-Dahl (Digital Europe), C Neppel (IEEE), D Boswarthick (ETSI), F Ozog (Linaro), H Banthien (Platform Industrie 4.0), I Plöger (BDI), J Morrish (IIC), L Romero (ETSI), M Bell (Digital Europe), M Emele (Bosch),  M Jochem (Bosch), M Milinkovich (Eclipse Foundation), R Riemenschneider (European Commission) and W Diab (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42)"

        "content": "According to a recent report, in 2019 the average cost of a data breach to a company was $3.9 million, ranging from $1.8 million in India to $8.2 million in the United States. Fines for failing to comply with regulations or litigation by disgruntled customers can drive the costs much higher.\nIn 2017, the US health insurance company Anthem settled a class action lawsuit for $115 million over a breach that had compromised the personal information of nearly 79 million people.  A year later, Yahoo settled a lawsuit brought by shareholders for $80 million.\nIncreasingly companies are taking out cyber-insurance to cover financial losses resulting from a breach. Losses may include the costs of notifying affected parties, legal fees, compensating affected individuals and regulatory fines.\nWhen purchasing cyber insurance, it is crucial to know what is covered and what prompts payment. For example, cyber-extortion costs are usually covered in full, although there are jurisdictions where coverage for some cyber-extortion risks is not permitted.\nISO/IEC 27102 offers guidance on cyber-insurance, including the kind of losses covered, what triggers payment and what measures need to be on place to satisfy the insurance providers. The publication notes that, “The adoption of cyber-insurance to reduce the impacts of the consequences arising from a cyber-incident should be considered by an organization in addition to information security controls as part of an effective risk treatment approach”.\nISO/IEC 27102 provides advice about both first- and third-party coverage. First-party insurance covers costs related to the damage or loss of its cyber assets. Third-party insurance covers those responsible for the systems through which the breach occurred.\nCyber security insurance can also cover reimbursable expenses, usually related to the recovery process. These include, for example, the cost of forensic investigations, extortion in the case of ransomware, and business losses."

        "content": "Smart city standards can help cities all over the world to benefit more quickly and effectively from global best practice and provide new opportunities for industry.\nThe IEC has developed many standards that are important for the efficient functioning of cities. Over 1 800 standards have been identified that are vital to cities, in sectors such as energy, lighting, transport and city services. However, smart cities require a holistic approach. As a result, the IEC has taken a systems methodology to better address the complexity of smart cities which are systems of systems.\nIn the area of information technology, the IEC partners with ISO to develop standards for smart cities. According to Heng Qian, Convenor of the joint IEC and ISO working group on smart cities (ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 11), “JTC 1 is focused on ICT aspects. Many of the technologies used in smart cities, such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, privacy, rely upon the standards developed by JTC 1”.\nNew standard published\nIn October 2019, IEC and ISO published a new standard, ISO/IEC 30146, which provides assessment indicators and evaluation methods to measure the functionality of different ICT systems within a city. Indicators have been developed to evaluate such systems as a city’s transportation, public safety and city management services. The indicators can be used to measure a smart city holistically or tailored to measure individual parts of the city.\nAccording to Qian, “the standard is based on international best practices and is already being tested in several countries around the world. It can be used to help promote the harmonious development of smart city projects”.\nStandards under development\nWork is underway to develop a smart city ICT reference framework. Three standards will be published, each addressing a different viewpoint within a city and focus on the concerns for each of the viewpoints, to be used by city information officers when planning and implementing a smart city. The frameworks include business process, knowledge management and engineering. “From the ICT perspective, it gives the stakeholders in the smart city a common understanding of the full framework”.\nFurther standards are also under development which address smart city data terminology and digital platforms.\nAreas for future work\nIt can be expected that the new areas of interest in ICT standardization work, such as digital twins, trustworthiness and data usage, will find their way into smart cities. However, as Qian notes, “we need to be aware of the uniqueness of smart cities and their ICT requirements. They will require the interoperability of data, the coordination of urban operating systems and a platform for open data”.\nOther topics of interest include city data models and smart city visualization. Smart cities will need to integrate data from multiple systems and a framework will be necessary to integrate the information. With smart city visualization, users can access a single platform that brings together the various data points about a city and its various systems in real-time and in a visual manner. Doing so provides contextual information on the environment and the various systems within the city.\nHowever, as Qian noted, “we need to work quickly because cities need these standards”.\nFor further information, read the full article in e-tech."

        "abstract": "IEC has just published a key standard that will help those wishing to make a transition to hydrogen as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuel.",
        "content": "Many experts around the world are contemplating a “hydrogen society” as a complete and sustainable alternative to our fossil fuel-based economies. IEC has just published a key standard that will help those wishing to make a transition to this clean alternative to fossil fuel.\n In June 2019, the IEA published a much talked-about report, The Future of Hydrogen, analysing the current state of play for hydrogen and offering guidance on its future development. “Hydrogen is today enjoying unprecedented momentum, driven by governments that both import and export energy as well as the renewable energy (RE), electricity and gas utilities, automakers, oil and gas companies, major technology firms and big cities”, says Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director.\nHydrogen can be generated from natural gas and biomass, but also from oil, coal and nuclear energy as well as by electrolysis using REs such as solar or wind. Once generated, it can be compressed and liquefied for storage and transportation in fuel tanks.\nIt can even be transported using the existing infrastructure of natural gas pipelines. As a means of energy storage, it can compensate the fluctuation of some RE sources and over long periods of time.\n“Hydrogen is very attractive for large scale and long-term energy storage,” says Tsuneji Kameda, who is one of the convenors of an IEC working group which standardizes energy storage systems using fuel cell modules in reverse mode.\nA fuel cell converts the chemical energy of a fuel (often hydrogen) and an oxidizing agent (often oxygen) into electricity. In reverse mode, fuel cells can convert electricity back into hydrogen.\nUnlike batteries, there is little or no self-discharge during the storage period. “Hydrogen has similar storage capacity than pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage but has a superior charge and discharge efficiency and is not at all dependent on location, contrary to pumped hydro. In addition, pumped hydro facilities can take a long time to build,” Kameda adds.\nThe working group published IEC 62282-8-201, a robust and complete performance standard for energy storage systems using fuel cells in reverse modes. The standard enables stakeholders to select and compare existing systems.\n“There are different types of electrolysers and equipment for system management as well as forms of hydrogen storage. Some of the properties of the systems also depend on their operating conditions. The standard provides a useful performance comparing guide for systems users and suppliers. The idea is also to promote different applications for the system,” Kameda says.\nHydrogen is already used for energy storage in Japan. One major Japanese manufacturer provides a number of solutions, some of which combine hydrogen for storage to mitigate the fluctuations of energy due to the use of RE systems over long periods of time and a battery storage system which can mitigate the use of RE over short periods of time.\nRead more in The age of hydrogen."

        "content": "Producing standards for the IoT is an extremely vast and complex enterprise. So many areas, from smart manufacturing right down to e-health are impacted by IoT systems.\nYet, standards are required for these different systems to be able to talk to each other, monitor the quality of the data produced or make sure the systems are sufficiently resilient, etc.\nThat’s where the work of a joint committee formed by ISO and IEC (ISO/IEC JTC 1) comes in. Created to prepare standards for information technology (IT), one of its subcommittees, SC 41, is developing standards for the IoT. Its Chair, François Coallier, outlines the roadmap for standardization in a variety of different areas.\n“We started by developing technology-agnostic standards, promoting very high level, generic interoperability. These include ISO/IEC 30141 which establishes a common vocabulary and architecture as well as, more recently, interoperability standards ISO/IEC 21823-1 and ISO/IEC 21823-2. A lot more work will have to be put in at the lower levels, when we start going into the different application areas.\n“We have built liaisons with different groups and committees inside the IEC, for instance with IEC Technical Committee 65 which prepares standards for industrial-process measurement, control and automation. This concerns smart manufacturing standards, for instance, and the Industrial IoT. It has a lot to do with the convergence between operating technology (OT) and IT.\n“We are also looking to cooperate with the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). They are experts, notably in the field of plug and play, and their input is important and should help us to widen our user-base.\n“We will be working with the Systems Committee on Smart Energy as well as with IEC TC 57 to look specifically at IoT and power systems. These committees are very close to industry and can help us define specifications for interfaces and so on. I am also the convenor of an advisory group inside JTC 1 on autonomous and data rich vehicles, because that is an important sector we need to be incolved in as well. Our initial focus will be in these areas. We will also be looking at agricultural requirements. Health, wearables and consumer tech will come later.”"

        "content": "Mind-reading technology is making headway in medical science. In 2019, a young tetraplegic man in France was able to walk by controlling an exoskeleton with brain signals.\nThe technology, which works by recording and decoding brain signals, was trialled for two years by scientists at biomedical research centre Clinatec and the University of Grenoble in France. The brain computer interface relied on implants surgically placed under the subject’s skull.\nThere are also other, non-medical applications of brain-scanning technologies. They demonstrate that our electric brains have a huge potential that is only just beginning to be harnessed.\nThis year’s CES featured a brain-operated TV remote control. The headset, produced by a French startup founded by neuroscientists, is fitted with sensors that monitor electrical pulses in the wearer’s brain.\nThe device translates brain waves into digital commands, allowing the wearer to zap TV channels or turn up the volume. It can also be used for gaming.\nWorkers in China are wearing helmets equipped with brain sensors to monitor changes in their mood. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the technology is used to increase workers’ productivity. Concerns have been raised about the invasion of workers’ privacy.\nIEC has set up a System Committee on Active Assisted Living (SyC AAL), which focuses on the standardization of AAL products, services and systems to enable independent living for elderly or disabled users. IEC TC 100 develops standards for audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment and set up a technical area (TA) to develop standards relating to AAL wearable electronic devices and technologies, as well as accessibility and user interfaces.\nThe drawback of mind-reading wearables is that the signals emitted by the brain are hindered by people’s skulls and hair which get in the way of the electric waves. Scientists have therefore been focusing on using implants to control items remotely, even if these technologies are invasive as they imply some form of surgery.\nThe BrainGate programme is a long-running multi institution research effort in the US to develop neurotechnology aimed at restoring communication, mobility and independence to people with neurogenerative diseases, limb loss or paralysis. As part of the programme, devices named Utah Arrays were implanted in the brains of several trial patients who were then able to shop online and send phone messages to friends.\nOther US companies are investing into similar technology, including one of Elon Musk’s enterprises. The focus is on developing the least invasive form of implants, requiring little or no surgery.\nDespite the ongoing investment and research, it will take many years for these technologies to hit the consumer market. It is still very early days and we are far from being able to control our immediate environment using our brain waves, let alone be able to read each other’s minds.\n \nThis is an edited version of an article originally published in e-tech.

They do not specify how to build the reader or the tag.\nThey set out the requirements for the equipment to conform with the standards, and the language to be used when organizing the dialogue between the reader and the tag.\nAn example would be the commands that the reader sends to the tags to make them behave a specific way, such as to allow the reading of multiple tags at the same time, which requires a very specific dialogue. ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 31 develops horizontal international standards which are adopted by various industries.\nTyres\nFor example, the tyre sector uses the technology in its simplest form, meaning the tag only contains the identifier of the item to which it is attached, to keep track of it during production. But there are other benefits of using electronic labelling.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers (OEMs) use it to track a tyre throughout its lifecycle using a unique identifier per tyre, but it could also be used to access additional information, such as the tyre dimension, type and quality. Normally this is engraved directly on the tyre, which can get dirty and then cannot be read, however, the RFID tag would be embedded in the tyre itself.\nBy using RFID tags, regulators, customs and specific types of users, such as fleet managers would be able to access other information, including if the tyre is authorized in a country, type of use, and which markets it is available in. If an ultra-high frequency (UHF) tag is embedded in the tyre, it can be read from a distance of up to 10 metres.\nWhile ISO has developed a series of application standards for the RFID tagging of tyres, these application standards are based on technical standards provided by SC 31, mainly ISO/IEC 18000-63.\nAirline companies\nAnother example is the airline industry. Travellers who fly expect their luggage to arrive with them, but when it doesn’t, they want to be able to locate it as quickly as possible.\nWhen it comes to handling lost luggage, while the barcode works, it can get damaged. If this happens bags may get lost in the sorting centre.\nEqually if there is a lot of luggage, if a barcode is not positioned so that the scanner has a clear line of sight, it won’t be read, and it will be considered as lost. But if you have an RFID tag, it will have a 99.9 % accuracy reading rate, which is much higher than the barcode.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced last year that it will deploy RFID luggage tracking, globally. This means a transition to barcoded bag tags with RFID inlays.\nIATA has not yet decided which coding structure to use for the tag data content, but one can say confidently that the base technology will be using the ISO/IEC 18000-63 standard.\n\nHenri Barthel chairs ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 31: Automatic identification and data capture techniques. He was speaking to Antoinette Price.

        "content": "Over 240 participants joined the IEC Academy webinar to learn more about the circular economy and the role of standards. The webinar was hosted by the IEC Academy & Capacity Building (ACB).\nThe IEC Academy webinar, led by the Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on Environmental Affairs (ACEA), Solange Blaszkowski, and the ACEA TF lead, Jens Giegerich, provided an overview of the key principles and terminology of the circular economy and material efficiency and how they are impacting standardization.\nBlaszkowski started by providing a definition of the circular economy as a systemic approach to the design of processes, products, services and business models with the aim of delivering sustainable economic growth. However, this is only possible by the effective management of resources and, consequently, a circular flow of materials that ultimately eliminates waste.\nBlaszkowski stated that a circular economy must be based on such foundations as:\n\nFavourable system conditions through the support of policy makers and public opinion.\nInnovative business models.\nCircular design and production to improve the use of materials. This is possible with products that are designed to facilitate repair, reuse, upgrade, refurbishment and remanufacture.\nClosing the material cycle. Mechanisms need to be put in place that allow products to be returned and materials and parts reused.\n\nWhile the broad social and economic implications of the circular economy are outside the scope of IEC work, the IEC can provide support on issues related to resource efficiency which encompasses both energy efficiency and material efficiency.\nAccording to Blaszkowski, material efficiency calls for a reduction in the consumption of natural resources by ensuring the efficient use of material within products and keeping the material in use for as long as possible. As a result, products need to be designed using less material, with intention of lasting longer and with possibility to extend their functionality through reuse, repair, refurbishment and remanufacture.\nThese are more important than recycling and recovery of materials, which should occur only at the end of the product lifetime.\nHow standards can support circularity\nBlaszkowski noted that as products last longer, standards will be needed to ensure product safety, performance and reliability. Issues like data removal and security must also be considered as products are reused and change ownership.\nLegislation is expected to require the increased use of used parts as well as products that can more easily be repaired. Standards will be needed to guarantee the properties of the used material as well as define the requirements for parts reliability.\nGiegerich noted that an IEV standard is needed to provide harmonized use of terms and definitions associated with the circular economy and material efficiency. He called on experts to join a joint working group that will be set up under TC 1 to develop this terminology.\nMaterial efficiency standards in IEC\nIn many parts of the world, countries have begun to adopt regulations that can promote a circular economy and material efficiency. For example, material efficiency requirements have been included in regulations for the eco-design of products in Europe.\nWithin the IEC, several technical committees have developed standards that support material efficiency for electrical and electronic products. These standards include:\n\nIEC TR 62635 with information on product end of life, including the recyclability rate calculation.\nIEC TR 62824 with guidance about material efficiency considerations the eco-design of products.\nIEC 62309 which examines the dependability of products containing used parts.\nIEC 63077 which specifies the process for ensuring the performance and safety of refurbished medical imaging equipment.\n\nHowever, as Blaszkowski noted, this list is not complete. Other TCs, such as TC 56, have developed several standards related to durability, reliability and dependability.\nCurrently a number of standards are under development. For example, TC 111 is preparing a standard covering principles of product circularity in environmental conscious design while TC 62 and TC 2 are developing standards on the refurbishment of medical equipment and rotating machinery, respectively.\nAccording to Blaszkowski, new standards covering requirements for introducing material efficiency in the design of products, such as circular ready design are highly needed. Plans are already underway for starting such standards work in the IEC.\nThe circular economy, and specifically material efficiency, will influence areas of standardization such as safety, energy efficiency, performance and EMC. As Blaszkowski noted, a holistic approach is needed to ensure that the protection of the environment is not detrimental to any of these other areas.\nThe webinar, including the full audio and presentation, will soon be made available on the IEC website in the section of the IEC Academy & Capacity Building. Since 2018, the IEC Academy & Capacity Building organizes and hosts free public webinars. Registration for future webinars as well as access to the previous webinars are available online.

        "content": "Can you take a picture underwater with your smartphone? Or drop your smartphone in a bucket of water? Despite the images showcased in promotional material, water remains the culprit for 39% of accidental smartphone damage in the United States and it is likely that the figure is similar around the world.\nIn recent years, phone manufactures have advertised the water resistance as a key design feature of their high-end smart phones. But phrases like waterproof or water-resistant sound vague. It is for this reason that the IEC has developed, and continually updates, IEC 60529 to rate the resistance of an enclosure used for products like smart phones, tablets and cameras, against the intrusion of dust and liquids.\nThe standard, prepared by Technical Committee 70, rates the degrees of protection offered by the enclosure using the IP Code and defines the tests to be performed to verify that the enclosure meets the requirements of the standard.\nThe IP code is composed of two numerals. The first numeral refers to the protection against solid objects and is rated on a scale from 0 (no protection) to 6 (no ingress of dust). The second numeral rates the enclosure’s protection against liquids and uses a scale from 0 (no protection) to 9 (high-pressure hot water from different angles). The digits indicate conformity with the conditions summarized in the chart.\nHowever, the IP rating is an indication of how the device was tested, not the conditions in which it can be used. According to says Axel Klingberg, Convenor of the maintenance team for IEC 60529, “this world-wide agreed (upon) standard is only describing the way to test products — not more, not less. A few drops of water inside can be very dangerous in one product, but not another.” So an accidental drop in the pool may be okay for a smartphone but it would be best to avoid using it as an underwater camera.\nThe first edition of IEC 60529 was published in 1976 with the aim of creating a single document to bring together all requirements regarding protection offered by the enclosure used by electric and electronic devices."

        "content": "As technologies advance rapidly, they are changing how we live and work and along with this, the expectations of people and businesses. Leadership and management of public, private and not-for-profit organizations must stay up to date with this evolution.\nThis is challenging as business operations are often complex, involving data rich systems which provide diverse services. New technologies bring different terminology, definitions, ways of doing things, opportunities for innovation and new threats to business viability.\nOne way to address these issues is through standardization. IEC and ISO develop international standards for ICT, which cover many areas, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cyber security and more.\nJan Begg is Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 40, which develops standards for IT services and IT governance. Among some of the key standards already published is ISO/IEC 38500, Governance of IT for the organization, which is a guidance document comprising six principles that can be applied to any technology or service enabled by technology.\nSC 40 has also developed the ISO/IEC 30105 series of standards for IT enabled business process outsourcing (BPO). The five-part series defines processes to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve its services. More recently it has added Part 6, an exemplar for maturity assessment, which gives clients an opportunity to see how their outsourced supplier is measuring up against others.\nDuring a meeting in New Delhi last November, Begg talked about some of the work SC 40 is doing around data and AI.\n\n“We are seeing in the regulatory landscape that there is a real emphasis on privacy and protecting the liberty of individuals. Our standards in SC 40 are around principles for governance of technology and that can give boards a head start on getting their policies, procedures, their risk management in place, well before the regulators pass laws”.\n\nEvery organization creates data and their customers and suppliers are creating data. We have obligations to protect that, classify it and use it. Our standards are evolving in that space. SC 40 has 38505 Part 1, which is an application of our governance principles, specifically for data.\n“It helps boards understand: What are the key things they need to protect? Who owns what? How can they classify it? We are now expanding that into data classification and in the future, we will look at the whole realm of digital data governance”.\nSC 40 is working with SC 42: Artificial intelligence, on the governance implications of the use of AI technologies by organizations.\n“We are looking at what the role of the board is when it comes to AI technologies. Some organizations think it is about ethics at the core, governance, risk management, but SC 40 and SC 42 think there is more to it. We think the governance of technology needs foundations in principles that extend beyond that and help boards make decisions and execute their accountability”, said Begg.\nThe collaboration between SC 40 and SC 42 covers different industries and related technology areas, such as analytics, big data, IoT, cyber security and more, in order to come up with a guidance document that can be understood by both audiences. Find out more here."

The technology used is based on the same principle as electroencephalograms. The brain emits electrical signals and these can be read and then transformed into digital commands for compatible appliances.\nStandards for these emerging technologies are essential as they help to save time and money for entrepreneurs who wish to bring new products to market. IEC Technical Committee (TC) 47 publishes key standards for the design, use and reuse of sensors, enabling users to measure their performance, for instance. IEC TC 124 develops standards for wearable devices. IEC TC 100 develops standards for audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment and set up a technical area (TA) to develop standards relating to active assisted living wearable electronic devices and technologies, as well as accessibility and user interfaces.\nMind reading tech\nIt must also be said that if people can use gadgets to control devices with their brain, similar gadgets can enable others to read their mind. In China, workers have been wearing helmets equipped with brain sensors which feed information to their employers about their state of mind – angry, depressed or anxious. The technology is used in the military, power supply and telecoms industry, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. The technology is used to increase workers’ productivity. Concerns have been raised about the invasion of workers’ privacy.\nIn 2019, a young French man suffering from tetraplegia demonstrated how he could power an exoskeleton with his brain and walk. The technology, which works by recording and decoding brain signals, was trialled for two years by scientists at biomedical research centre Clinatec and the University of Grenoble in France. But unlike the wearable headband launched by the Gaul startup, the brain computer interface, in this case, relied on implants surgically placed under the subject’s skull.\nRead more about this topic in Brain power"

Additionally, aging populations will need lifelong training as their working environments are reshaped by technology.\nErlend Øverby leads IEC and ISO joint standardization work through ISO/IEC JTC 1/ SC 36 which covers IT for learning, education and training (ITLET) and talks about the impact of technology on teaching and how standards can help ensure key aspects such as interoperability of systems and devices used, as well as ensure data privacy.\nData privacy is paramount\nAs education uses increasing number of online programmes, applications and devices, students will create profiles and large amounts of personal data as they complete their work online. Additionally, there is an growing amount of video and photo content created in learning contexts.\n“Having control of the data produced by students is increasingly important and the only way to achieve this is to use standards […] we need to keep data produced by children in schools safe and not used for other purposes than providing a better education”, says Øverby.  \n\n \n\nInteroperable technology\nAnother issue that arises from the use of diverse software systems and hardware, is the need for interoperability between the different technologies deployed by schools and learning institutions.\n“[…] There is an increasing need for interoperability and the only way to ensure this is by applying standards. The schools need to see they are part of a bigger whole as the technology is being used, and all the way to governments and ministers of education to take care of the needs and desires of the schools using technology. Standards are the tool that enables this […]”, Øverby concludes.\n\n \n\nSocial Share"

        "content": "A new economic model is emerging that re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption. It is based on circular mechanisms in which products and materials can be reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured and, ultimately, recycled. \nAn increasingly popular topic, the notion of a circular economy is gaining traction not only among environmentalists and academics but also within governmental and business sectors.\nAccording to Solange Blaszkowski, Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA), the concept of a circular economy is a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived. “In very simple terms, circular economies are about resources and how to keep them in use”. The circular economy approach reassesses how resources are managed and how waste is perceived throughout the entire lifecycle of a product.\nBringing in material efficiency\nMaterial efficiency is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the conservation of materials by making products more durable and repairable as well as facilitates the reuse and recycling at the end of the product life.\nAs Blazkowski notes, “the idea of material efficiency is that we cannot keep using up the Earth’s resources because very soon we will run out and we will not have them any more to make new products and new technologies. Therefore, what we need to do is make better use of materials that are currently already in use”.\nMaterial efficiency calls for the responsible use of materials which need to remain available, not only for now or for one use, but continuously through recycling and reuse.\nRole of standards\nStandards can serve as an important tool to promote the circular economy and material efficiency. They can, for example, provide methods to measure the durability or upgradeability of a product. They can assess the ease with which a product can be repaired or recycled. And, they can ensure the quality of the recycled materials.\nStandard developers will need to address the balance between making products that withstand increased number of repair cycles and contain increased number of reused components while still ensure that they perform well and remain safe. Trade-offs may also be necessary between making products last longer and minimizing their energy consumption.\nIn some cases, repairing a product may not be advisable if the associated costs are greater than the value of the product or have the potential for causing harm to the person making the repairs.\nIEC webinar on the circular economy and material efficiency\nThe IEC will host a free webinar to help better understand the circular economy and material efficiency and their impact on the development of standards. Members of the IEC ACEA will explain why the circular economy and material efficiency are important for the technical standardization work of IEC.\nThe webinar will take place on Friday, 14 February at 9h CET and 15h CET. Registration is available on the IEC website."

        "content": "Jürgen Steinhäuser has been appointed Chair of IEC Technical Committee 94: All-or-nothing electrical relays, until 28 February 2026. He will start his duties in March.\nElectrical relays can be defined as electrically controlled devices that open and close an electrical contact to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another circuit. Relays are crucial in today’s industrial processes. According to some estimates, more than 25 billion relays operate today all over the world as an interface between electrical control circuits and electrical loads. There are different types of relays, one of theme being all-or-nothing relays. For the less technically minded, suffice to say that these relays must be supplied with a definite range of voltage (or current). They can be activated by supplying or removing voltage (or current) within the prescribed range. A more technical definition can be found in the IEC Electropedia.\n\n\nJürgen Steinhäuser\n\n \n\nJürgen Steinhäuser has worked for several companies in Germany and Switzerland which specialize in sensors and relays and is currently at Swiss-based ELESTA. The company was founded in 1997 as a manufacturer of relays with forcibly guided contacts in accordance with IEC 61810-3 and has widened its portfolio to custom sensors and miniature encoders. Steinhäuser is responsible for standards and professional associations in addition to being a sales and marketing manager. ELESTA belongs to Germany’s Pilz group of companies. In 2014, Steinhäuser won the IEC 1906 Award which honours IEC experts around the world whose work is fundamental to the organization.\n“ I am very honoured to have been appointed Chair of TC 94 as relay technology is facing new challenges  in the fields of electromobility, smart grids and urban compaction”, he states."

        "content": "January 28 is Data Privacy Day, also known as Data Protection Day in Europe. The aim of the event is to raise awareness and to promote best practices in cyber security. \nThis year, Data Privacy Day comes a few days after the publication of ISO/IEC 27007, Information technology – Security techniques – Guidelines for information security management systems auditing. It is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards that together provide a trusted framework for managing information risks effectively.\nThe newly updated standard provides extensive guidance on auditing the requirements in ISO/IEC 27001, as well as on the competence of information security management systems (ISMS) auditors.\nIt is the job of an ISMS to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data — the so-called CIA triad. An ISMS includes legal, physical and technical controls designed to protect assets from threats and vulnerabilities.\nTaken together, the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide organizations with a toolkit to cope with a continuously evolving cyber threat landscape. Attack vectors are multiplying as threat actors gain access to ever more sophisticated technology.\nLegal compliance\nIn the current environment, organizations not only face risks to their operations, but are also more exposed than ever before to the threats of litigation and reputational damage. Sweeping regulatory change is further increasing the pressure on organizations to protect personal data.\nISO/IEC 27701 is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 that not only specifies the requirements for a privacy information management system, but also takes into the regulatory environment in which organizations operate. For example, ISO/IEC 27701 maps its provisions against the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nConformity assessment\nStandards provide even more value when they are combined with testing and certification. The IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies that ensure consistent results from anywhere in the world.\nLast year, the certification bodies of IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, began to cover the assessment and certification to ISO/IEC 27001 for the first time. This was at the request of industry.\nAlthough certification to ISO/IEC 27001 has existed since the standard was published in 2013, there was no harmonization among the many certification bodies that have been offering their own individual certificates and applying their own individual interpretations of ISO/IEC 27001.\nOver time, this has resulted in different approaches and differences in what is accepted by the various certification bodies. Industry felt that IECQ was able to provide a benchmark approach.\nIECQ is a worldwide approval and certification system that covers the supply, assembly, associated materials and processes of a large variety of electronic components used in millions of devices and systems. It provides manufacturers with independent verification that the requirements in IEC International Standards and other specifications were met by suppliers.\nFind out more\nThe joint technical committee set up by IEC and ISO, JTC 1, develops the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards.

New technologies and environmental concerns are driving much of the standardization work.\nMaking printers and copiers easily accessible to the disabled is one area where standards are in the process of being updated. Features such as simplified displays to help those with weak eyesight, reduced height of multifunctional printers and easy sliding trays are a few examples.\nISO/IEC 10779 accessibility guidelines from 2008 have been updated and a new version will be published in early 2020.\nSC 28 is also looking at productivity in 3D printing. Conventional printers provide measurements of how many copies are produced per minute. For 3D printing and scanning, SC 28 will look at how many hours are needed for production.\nSC 28 has also established liaisons with the JTC 1 working group on 3D printing, ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 12.\nOther technologies such as IoT and cloud computing are providing opportunities to offer new print services.\nFor example, companies may outsource their printing needs or use networks to centralize their printing needs. Data collected from the printing network can be used to identify under-performing machines or automate the delivery of printing supplies.\nRemote printing from off-site locations and from any devices is possible. To leverage some of these new opportunities, SC 28 has set up a liaison with the JTC 1 subcommittee on the Internet of Things, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41.\nAnother priority is standardization for environmentally friendly machines.

        "content": "Today, people must work with non-human entities, which are incorporating diverse artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.\nFor example, in healthcare, robotic arms carry out surgery and other procedures, while doctors use analysis from big data, mined by machine learning algorithms, to help diagnose diseases.\nIn manufacturing plants, robots and people work in close proximity side by side, each carrying out specific activities.\nOn the ground and in the air, the growing use of automated systems, include advanced driver assistance and other features in cars, while modern airline autopilot and safety systems are deployed in planes. Both rely on sensor data processing algorithms to analyze data gathered from many sensors around the vehicles and aircraft in order to ensure safe, efficient journeys.\nChallenges and the need for standards\nIn these and many more cases, we are literally putting our lives in the “hands” of the technology, which we must trust with our personal safety and well-being. This is why it is imperative that nothing goes wrong.\nA key barrier to adoption of artificial intelligence is concerns about the trustworthiness of the system. The standardization work being carried out by IEC and ISO not only tries to identify and put a framework around these emerging issues, it also provides technical approaches to mitigating the concerns and links to the non-technical requirements such as ethical and societal challenges.\nVideo interview with experts working on standards for trustworthiness\nIn the following video interview Wael Diab and two of his colleagues, Mikael Hjalmarson, Editor ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 ethical and societal concerns project (ISO/IEC TR 24368) and David Filip, Convenor, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Working Group 3, Trustworthiness, discuss the work they are doing for trustworthiness of systems using AI technologies.\n“This revolutionary approach of looking at the full AI ecosystem will enable wide scale adoption of AI and the promise it has as a ubiquitous technology enabling the digital transformation”, says Wael Diab, who the leads the group doing this work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat is trustworthiness and how can we ensure it?\nThe work has already identified certain characteristics of trustworthiness, such as accountability, bias, controllability, explainability, privacy, robustness, resilience, safety and security. However, it always comes back to transparency or transparent verifiability of AI systems. In other words, is there someone who can assess the system for vulnerabilities or unintended consequences? In order to be trustworthy, people need to be able to understand the algorithm’s internal workings.\nAchieving trustworthiness will require humans to be part of the process, to vet and control what the underlying AI algorithms are and that the associated training data don’t introduce unfair or otherwise unwanted bias."

        "content": "Healthcare costs are rising across the world. As populations age and healthcare services become available to a greater number of people, the demand for services is increasing. \nMaximizing the value of medical equipment by reusing it can be one way of reducing costs. Refurbishment provides a process for ensuring that used medical equipment complies with the manufacturer’s specifications.\nThe IEC has recently published a new standard IEC 63077, Good Refurbishment Practices for Medical Imaging Equipment, that defines a systematic process for refurbishing used medical imaging equipment. The safety and performance of the medical equipment can be guaranteed without compromising the equipment’s performance, safety specification or intended use.\nMarkus Braun, the Convenor for the group responsible for preparing the standard, has participated in standardization work related to refurbished medical equipment for many years. He notes that “safety and performance are the most important aspects to be considered with medical equipment and this is no different when reutilizing used medical equipment.\nRefurbishment is a method to ensure the continued safety and performance of used equipment as it moves from one medical facility to another”.\nMedical imaging equipment, which includes X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonic equipment, requires a significant financial investment. According to Braun, “for complex and expensive equipment, it makes sense not to waste all of the inherent work and value. Generally, such equipment can be used for as long as service support is provided”.\nA growing market\nThe refurbishment of medical imaging devices has been an established practice for nearly two decades. According to analysts, the market for refurbished medical equipment is growing and will exceed USD 16 billion by 2024.\nThe North American market, comprised of the United States and Canada, represents the largest market for refurbished medical devices and is projected to have high growth rate in the coming years.\nAccording to Braun, “refurbishment addresses the high demand for affordable and reliable products. Customers of refurbished medical imaging equipment are not only small hospitals with limited budgets but also leading medical institutions. Refurbishment is a well-established element of the global healthcare economy”.\nAs an international standard, IEC 63077 allows companies to get certified through an auditing process to check the integrity of the refurbishment process. “This standard is intended to give regulators confidence on the well-established processes in the refurbishment”, concludes Braun."

Other participants will include the IEC General Secretary, Frans Vreeswijk, and the MSB convenor, Dr Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, who is also a vice -president of the IEC.\nTwo other IEC vice-presidents, the chairs of the Conformity Assessment Board and the Standardization Management Board, respectively Shawn Paulsen and Ralph Sporer, are also taking part. Scott Colburn is representing the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, a voluntary group of regulators from around the world.\nThe meeting will include a visit to the high-tech Siemens factory in the Bavarian town of Amberg. The plant uses many of the technologies associated with the fourth industrial revolution, including artificial intelligence, robotics and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).  \nThe physical factory has a digital twin to help plan the production processes and programme machines, as well as designing products and testing them. All these technologies rely on standards created by the IEC and JTC 1, the joint technical committee for ICT set up by the IEC and ISO.\nThe MSB, which reports to the IEC Council Board, meets twice a year. It identifies the principal technological trends and market needs in the IEC’s fields of activity.\n“The MSB sets strategies to maximize input from primary markets and establishes priorities for the technical and conformity assessment work of the IEC, improving the response of the IEC to the needs of innovative and fast-moving markets,” says MSB secretary Peter Lanctot.\nThe members of the IEC Market Strategy Board are corporate level leaders and principles of their companies. They represent mainly electrical equipment manufacturers, suppliers and utilities; however, it welcomes members who are from government and regulatory agencies, conformity assessment, software solution providers and ICT.\nA coverage of the broad scope of the IEC is desired in the membership of the MSB, with an emphasis on new markets, technologies and opportunities.\nAt MSB meetings, the members join forces in spotting principal technological trends and market needs. Currently the MSB members are working to establish a repeatable process and actionable strategy to deliver mid-to-long term technology surveillance for the IEC.\nConsultation and collaboration with the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) and IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) is necessary for this action, and it is likely that new entities for collaboration will be identified during this process.  Outputs from the MSB include White Papers, Technology Reports and Briefing Papers."

Italy comes in sixth position ahead of China. While China has been steadily increasing the number of its chairmanships since 2014 , this stopped in 2018 – a marked contrast to the growing role of China at the head of ISO Committees. The number of French Chairs increased, with new leadership at the head of IEC TC 111 and IEC TC 105. In 2019, France also acquired a new chairmanship, that of IEC TC 120.\nDifferent strategies are adopted by participating members: some countries opt to be active members in virtually every TC: China, Germany, the UK and Japan can be singled out for following that line. Others like France, Italy or the US have opted to be more selective in their participation. When it comes to the joint technical committee formed by IEC and ISO and which standardizes IT, JTC 1, and its various subcommittees, the US remains in the dominant position, although the country been losing some ground since 2016. A US Chair was however appointed head of SC 42, devoted to artificial intelligence standardization, in preference to a Chinese candidate.\nAFNOR also publishes several studies on the impact of standardization. One of the recent ones looks how standardization in electrotechnology in France helps exporters and boosts growth."

        "content": "Cloud computing has taken the IT industry by storm. Estimated at USD 24.6 billion in 2010, cloud computing has already surpassed USD 100 billion and is expected to reach USD 150 billion by the end of 2020.\nIndustry is adopting cloud computing and benefiting from the nearly instantaneous and positive impact of cloud technology. Eighty percent of companies report improvements to their operations within the first few months of adoption. Already, the average employee uses 36 cloud-based apps in their daily work.\nStandards can help to provide confidence and guidance in a rapidly changing industry. To enable the standardization of cloud computing at the international level, the IEC and ISO joint technical committee on IT set up a subcommittee in this area: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38. \nDefining cloud computing\nCloud computing is an enabling technology. It is based on the principles of shared devices, network access and shared data storage.\nAccording to the Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38, Steve Holbrook, cloud computing is the result of the “evolution of distributed computing over the last 60 years, ever since two computers could talk to each other, allowing us to go from the mainframe to the modern era. It is the latest and most efficient form of distributed computing”.\nEnabling AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is also evolving and improving especially with machine learning which uses data to find patterns and trends. Cloud computing is an essential element as it provides the storage for the data and the distributed processing used for analysis.\nAccording to Holbrook, AI is a “killer app that is lighting up cloud computing. It is illuminating an exciting horizon in technology. We need to enable technology that is smarter and more agile”.\nOpen Source innovations\nOpen source software is an area where much innovation is occurring within cloud computing. Holbrook noted, “the notion of containers is a new trend in cloud computing. The idea is that cloud services can be packaged and run in isolation in a platform independent way. Innovations like Kubernetes make it possible to manage workloads across multiple computers and teams”.\nStandardization can be important for open source. As pointed out by Holbrook, “standardization is especially needed to establish well known interfaces between technologies. However, there is a mismatch between the speed and culture of the open source community and the standardization community. Much is linked to meta concerns, such as legal and privacy issues, which is not top of mind for programmers in consortia”.\nRead the full interview with Steve Holbrook in e-tech."

        "content": "Manufacturers face many challenges of ensuring global supply chains and delivering global orders on time. Customer demands can change rapidly, bad weather and strikes can result in delays or cancellations of component parts, and machines do break down.\nIn order to address these issues, manufacturers are turning to AI technologies to streamline processes, reduce costs and downtime while maintaining quantity and quality of products. One key aspect of AI, is the ability to find insights in real time, in large data sources that humans would not be able to assess and analyse quickly enough.\nFor example, in machine learning based AI systems, the algorithms at the heart of AI can be used to predict when maintenance is needed, monitor and provide recommendations to improve quality, provide guidance on root cause analysis, improve yields and much more. AI not only enables these analytics, but by looking and learning from the data, the insights delivered can be tailored to specific applications.\nEthics and safety\nThere are however a number of points which must be dealt with, such as ethical and societal concerns such as the safety of machines working side by side with people in manufacturing plants, and the overall safety of AI enabled systems from a data perspective.\nOther important questions have also been raised around governance of such systems used in organizations, such as who is responsible for making decisions and managing how such systems are deployed? Do managers have enough of an understanding of the wider implications?\nHow standards can help\nStandards are essential to removing barriers to deployment, addressing concerns and ultimately accelerating adoption.\nWael Diab, who currently heads standards development for AI technologies and discusses the work being carried out with IEC and ISO families, which considers the entire AI ecosystem. He elaborates on the standards being developed for Big Data, trustworthiness, bias and robustness of neural networks, terminology and foundational frameworks, risk management and more, which can be used across diverse industries using AI technologies.\nRead the full article."

        "content": "Winding wires are in numerous electric and electronic devices we use every day, a key component which enables them to perform properly, safely and in an energy efficient manner. \nThey are ubiquitous in cars, fridges, diswashers, washing machines but also generators, electrical tranformers and wind turbines, to name but a few. The are the unsung heroes of insulation and conductivity.\n“I would say that each day, enough winding wire is produced to go around the earth at least ten times”, describes Andreas Levermann, who heads one of the working groups inside IEC TC 55, the IEC Technical Committee which prepares standards for winding wires.\nIn electric motors, winding wires transform electrical energy into mechanical energy by creating electromagnetic fields. Most of the wires are made of very pure copper, a highly conductive material, which can be densely packed into small areas.\nThe technology to produce these wires is very complex. “So many different properties are required: thermal, electrical, dimensional, chemical, insulating… The IEC 60317 and IEC 60851 series of standards, which together comprise more than one hundred publications, deal with those aspects”, Levermann explains.\nNew publication specifies reliable test methods for continuity\nJust before the end of 2019, the working group headed by Andreas Levermann issued a new edition of IEC 60851-5, which includes amendments made in 2008 and more recent ones added in 2019.\nThe new edition improves and clarifies the continuity tests for winding wires, making them more reliable and reproducible for on and offline measurement\n“The important aspect we wanted to specify in the new edition is continuity measurement. When you produce millions of kms of winding wire, it is impossible to avoid insulation weaknesses. IEC 60851-5 specifies reliable test methods and a low number of defects for a given length of wire. We worked hard to make this standard as international as possible – it is a compromise that makes it suitable for a wide number of countries”, he says.\nIEC TC 55 members reflect this striving for compromise: all continents are represented, with participating National Committees from China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Russia and the US as well as many observing countries, including Australia, Brazil and South Africa."

        "content": "For the tech industry, the New Year begins with the annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas to attend the consumer technology show known as CES. According the organizers, CES will bring together over 4 500 exhibitor, 170 000 attendees and 1 100 speakers from over 45 countries.\nWhile CES officially opens on Tuesday, 7 January, the event organizers have already provided a preview of some of the technology trends to watch in 2020 in a joint presentation by Steve Koenig and Lesley Rohrbaugh.\n5G\n5G promises higher speeds, lower latency and greater capacity than the current mobile system. This will allow for the deployment of widespread IoT services which rely upon ultra-reliable and low latency networks. Industry will lead in the deployment of 5G, using it for logistics and tracking, remote manufacturing and healthcare, grid automation and industrial control.\nAgriculture will also benefit from new digital technologies that rely upon 5G. Examples include automated farming equipment and robots, smart silos and soil sensors that will connect the farmer to the data necessary to run an efficient farm.\nArtificial intelligence\nAI will power many of the devices in homes and factories. According to Rohrbaugh, AI is entering many consumer devices, from television sets and ovens to showerheads and doorbells. Intelligence can enhance the home, offering a voice activated and connected user experience.\nExtended reality\nVirtual and augmented reality will become more prominent. AR glasses are becoming more realistic while VR headsets are becoming untethered. Gaming and e-sports are traditional users of extended reality. However, these devices can also be used in the workplace to increase productivity and provide training.\nFuture of transport\nInnovation is underway in the transport sector. It is allowing for faster charging batteries, self-driving fleets and car-to-car communications. Flying cars, officially known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts, are also becoming more prevalent.\nHealth\nDigital health is becoming a lifestyle with technology available to monitor sleep, wellness and fitness. In the United States, over a third of households own at least one wearable health device. And healthcare companies are beginning to use digital technologies to help extend their care, lower costs and provide remote services.\nRobotics\nTwo types of robots will be showcased during CES. Some robots will offer specific skills such as baking bread or folding clothes. Other robots will provide social companionship by, for example, allow individuals to remain in independent living situations despite advanced age or disabilities.\nIEC Standards\nThe promise of these new technologies is enticing. However, ensuring the safety, interoperability and performance of such technologies is an essential role of standards. IEC standards fuel the trends prominent during CES 2020 and stimulate their innovation."

        "content": "According to an international study, artificial intelligence is better at detecting breast cancer than expert radiologists.  Not only did the AI system detect more cancers in mammograms, but also ignored features the radiologists had incorrectly identified as possible tumours. \nA team of researchers from Google health and the University of London trained the machine learning technology on anonymous mammograms of more than 76,000 women in the UK and more than 15,000 women in the US. The hope is that AI could soon improve the effectiveness and accuracy of breast screening, but more clinical trials will be needed first.\nThe AI system has already outperformed six radiologists. To put that in perspective, it takes a medical student 10 years to train and qualify as a doctor capable of interpreting mammographs.\nInaccuracies, whether false negatives or false positives, can lead to delays in detection and treatment, needless stress and invasive biopsies. Around one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.\nInternational standards for AI and big data are developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC42, the Subcommittee on Artificial intelligence, of the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee on Information Technology. These standards will support the work of IEC TC 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice and that of other IEC TCs.\nMost regions face significant healthcare challenges. These include aging populations, lack of physicians or inadequate healthcare infrastructure.\nAI can provide important benefits in some domains, such as research, diagnosis, finding the most effective treatments, telemedicine, or developing entirely new and better drugs, to achieve what is known now as personalized or precision medicine.\nTo be of any use in any domain, AI needs to process and interpret extensive data sets to draw relevant conclusions. Agreements and safeguards permitting the exchange of healthcare information at country and international levels, provide an unequalled volume of data.\nSince the use of AI in healthcare means access to a large volume of data about individuals, the data must remain private and be protected from cyber threats.\nThis can be achieved, to a certain extent, though the anonymization of data, making it impossible to trace back information to individuals or clusters of individuals.\nThis is first and foremost the responsibility of healthcare professionals and service providers using best practices and, among others, standards developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27: Information security, cyber security and privacy protection.\nRelated content:\nArtificial intelligence and big data: a paradigm shift in healthcare"

        "content": "2019 has been an interesting year in standardization and technology. Below, we have listed the top stories on the IEC blog for each month of the year. \nJanuary: Making AI safer\nAn interview with Wael Diab, who leads IEC and ISO standardization activities for AI, who explains why AI needs standardization\nFebruary: Helping organization boards and executives ask and answer key questions about AI technologies\nIEC and ISO Joint Technical Committee for information technologies has established a new Joint Working Group (JWC), with two of its committees, SC 40: IT Service Management and IT Governance and SC 42: Artificial intelligence. The JWG is tasked with developing the international standard ISO/IEC AWI 38507, Governance implications of the use of artificial intelligence by organizations.\nMarch: New international standard will offer risk management framework for AI\nA new international standard is being developed by IEC and ISO, which will provide guidelines on managing risk faced by organizations during the development and application of AI techniques and systems. It will assist organizations in integrating risk management for AI into significant activities and functions, as well as describe processes for the effective implementation and integration of AI risk management.\nApril: New IEC Technical Report helps stakeholders evaluate human exposure to 5G base stations\nThe IEC has published a new Technical Report (TR) on evaluating human exposure to radio frequency fields in the vicinity of base stations. For the first time, it includes 5G base stations and small cells.\nMay: The university that teaches standards\nChina Jiliang University (CJLU) is located in Hangzhou, in Zhejiang province, in East China. The university has a threefold mission: “Metrology as the university’s cornerstone, standards as its code of conduct, and quality as its goal of career.” In other words, standards are central to the ethos of the university.\nJune: Understanding 5G\nIn terms of infrastructure, 5G is very different to previous networks. It uses a new beam steering technology that connects users through smaller more directional radio signals from the base station rather that a wider signal that is sent to all mobiles.\nJuly: Understanding risk with new international standard\nWhen the only certainty is uncertainty, the IEC and ISO ‘risk management toolbox’ helps organizations to keep ahead of threats that could be detrimental to their success.\nAugust: New standard for managing personal data\nA new international standard provides organizations with the clear guidance they need to reduce the risk to personal information. It takes into account not only national laws and regulations, but also the environment in which organizations operate.\nSeptember: Twin cities\nCity Information Modelling is the development of digital representations of a city comprised of large quantities of data – including real-time data – which enable better city planning and management. It is a giant system with various types of city information, from the natural environment to infrastructure to human activity. \nOctober: First IEC doc to be published in Chinese at IEC GM\nIEC 62257-9-5 which evaluates stand alone renewable energy products for rural electrification, and is published by IEC TC 82, will be directly available in the Chinese language. This is a crucial milestone both for the IEC and the Chinese National Committee (NC), as it is the first time that any IEC International Standard or TS is directly published in Chinese.\nNovember: New IEC Standard for wearable diabetes sensor\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 422 million people in the world suffer from diabetes. One of these breakthroughs is wearable glucose sensors.\nDecember: IECRE issues two new solar PV certificates\nThe IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, IECRE, was established in 2014 to address these issues. IECRE has recently issued a design certificate and a commissioning certificate for a PV power plant in China owned by the Shanghai ZPMC Electric Co., Ltd."

        "content": "IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) held its most recent meeting during the IEC General Meeting in Shanghai. Key topics covered include the UN Sustainable Development Goals, digital transformation, promoting regional balance and the implementation of the IEC Masterplan. \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe United Nations defines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the core of its blueprint for building a better world by 2030.\nThe SMB adhoc Group 84 was set up with the aim of educating the IEC community about the SDGs and formally identifying how the IEC contributes to each SDG through its standardization and conformity assessment systems.\nAfter reviewing the interim report submitted by ahG 84, the SMB has decided to extend its lifetime until June 2020. It has agreed with the ahG 84 recommendations including the identification and promotion of the SDGs in IEC work, the implementation of new IEC templates that can highlight how the IEC impacts the SDGs and the development of a communications plan to engage IEC stakeholders.\nAhG 84 will deliver its final report at the SMB meeting in June 2020.\nDigital Transformation\nDigital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new, or modify existing, business processes to meet changing business and market requirements. Strategic Group 12 defines the aspects of digital transformation that are relevant to the IEC and its standardization activities.\nAs a first step, SG 12 has developed the base classification model of machine-readable standards with a focus on the level of utility to machines, from paper form to fully machine interpretable form.\nThe SMB has now called on SG 12 to seek harmonization of its machine-readable standard concepts with ISO and CENELEC.\nPromoting diversity and regional balance\nIn June 2018, the SMB set up ahG 82 to help the IEC ensure that the participation in technical leadership positions is representative of National Committees from different regions.\nIn its report submitted to the SMB, ahG 82 agreed that more involvement is needed from different countries in the development of standards and, to ensure that IEC Standards remain globally relevant, it is essential to ensure a balanced geographical representation in IEC technical work.\nAhG 82 made several recommendations for the Council Board, IEC Academy and IEC Central Office (CO). It called on the Council Board Task Force on Diversity to develop an overall IEC policy statement on diversity, including geographical balance, and to determine the criteria for evaluating diversity. The report recommended that the IEC Academy provide tools and training to develop leadership skills and that the IEC CO provide an annual report tracking the geographical breakdown of SyCs/TCs/SCs leadership. These recommendations have been accepted by the SMB.\nThe report also makes several recommendations regarding secretariats of technical committees. It suggested the implementation of a programme similar to the ISO twinning programme in which the lead partner provides training and guidance to build the capacity of the twinned partner. The report also recommends amending the ISO/IEC Directives to include diversity as an attribute for leadership positions. In order to further examine these recommendations specific to secretariats, the SMB has set up ahG 85 on IEC Secretariats.\nWith the work of ahG 82 completed, the group will be disbanded.\nMasterplan implementation\nThe SMB is directly responsible for 13 Masterplan implementation goals. As of the end of 2019, the SMB is on target to meet its goals in the Masterplan Implementation Plan (MPIP).\nAs per the MPIP, the SMB has developed an outreach plan to engage relevant stakeholders and approved the guidelines for remote participation in technical meetings (see below). It has also circulated a report with the criteria for cases where direct industry participation in technical work could be appropriate.\nIn addition, the SMB is on track to meet three additional MPIP goals by the end of the year. Reports on how to increase international participation by regions and an analysis of the gaps and opportunities for the IEC to collaborate with other organizations are underway and will be finalized by the end of the year. The SMB will also complete its evaluation of 10% of technical committees on their role in fostering partnerships with other organizations.\nSimplifying participation in meetings\nThe SMB has agreed to allow remote participation for TC/SC plenary meetings. This is the result of a trial initiated by the SMB to explore the feasibility of remote participation following its introduction in IEC working group meetings.\nThe SMB has approved the following guidelines that outline the basic principles for remote participation:\n\nP-member obligation: remote participation at a TC/SC meeting is counted as fulfilling the NC obligation to maintain P-member status although it is at the discretion of TC/SC officers and the IEC CO Technical Officer.\nVoting rights: remote participants can vote and comment on any agenda item, although it is noted that voting and commenting can be made only by the Head of Delegate or a designated delegate as per IEC rules.\nNumber of remote participants: no limits are placed on the number of remote participants. However, TC/SC officers may limit the number of remote participants for technical reasons so long as notifications are made prior to the meeting and limitations are imposed equitably to all P-members.\nProvided on a best effort basis: remote participation is conducted on a “best effort” basis and remote participants will not be able to require that agenda items be revisited in cases of technical glitches such as, for example, a faulty network connection.\n\n \nAs a next step, ahG 76, which developed the draft guidelines and reviewed the results of the remote participation trial, is now tasked with preparing detailed implementation guidelines based on the above principles.\nNew work areas\nThe National Committee of China proposed the establishment of a new technical committee on power system stability control systems and equipment. According to the proposal, power system stability has become a major concern with several large-scale blackout events attributed to problems with these systems. A similar proposal has been made by the National Committee of Japan and has been merged with the proposal from the National Committee of China.\nAfter consultation with the Advisory Committee on Electricity Transmission and Distribution (ACTAD), the SMB has decided to refer the question to IEC TC 8: System aspects of electrical energy supply. TC 8 has confirmed its willingness to manage standardization activities related to grid stability and control. A questionnaire will be sent out to TC 8 members to determine their opinion on the establishment of a new subcommittee (SC 8C).\nThomas Edison Awards\nThe SMB presented its Thomas Edison Award to four individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the IEC:\n\nNorbert Bischof, Secretary TC 62, SC 62B, SC 62C\nFabio Gargantini, Chair TC 61, Secretary SC 59L\nMasahide Okamoto, Secretary TC 91\nHelmut Myland, Secretary TC 20\n\n \nCreated in 2010, the Thomas Edison Award recognizes exceptional achievement, dedicated service and significant contributions to the IEC by officers in IEC technical committees and subcommittees.\nNext meeting\nThe next SMB meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 February 2020 in New Delhi, India."

        "content": "Highlights of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) meeting, which took place during the 83rd IEC General Meeting in Shanghai, China.\nAddressing environmental issues\nCAB has begun looking into how it can provide opportunities to help industries comply with environmental standards. IEC TC 111 which addresses environmental standardization for electrical and electronic products and systems, has requested support from CAB to help identify potential conformity assessment services that could be offered.\nThis topic is already underway within IECQ which has set-up a working group tasked with developing a global solution on environmental issues, addressing hazardous substances, environmental product declarations and TC 111 standards. However, a CAB level approach is needed in order to offer unified CA schemes and better promote the range of services available.\nCAB has agreed to set up a task force, which includes the other IEC CA Systems, under the leadership of Marie-Elisabeth d’Ornano, IECQ Chair, which will investigate the business case for the creation of new services based on IEC standards related to the environment in conjunction with TC 111.\nRadio scheme proposal\nThe development of the Internet of Things has increased the number of radio and wireless products in use. However, compliance requirements for these types of products differ, making it difficult to achieve “one test one report” results. A proposal has been made to offer a IECEE service for radio products.\nHowever, many of the well-established and widely used standards for radio products are not published by the IEC or ISO. If the CAB would like to develop a radio scheme, it will need to consider the use of ETSI and ANSI standards.\nCAB has tasked IECEE, in collaboration with other IEC CA Systems, with exploring the business case for a possible service for Radio based upon relevant standards. It has also asked Working Group (WG) 10 to create guidelines for the selection and approval of non-IEC and non-ISO Standards for integration into the IEC CA Policy.\nCertification results in bilateral agreements\nThe CAB Alternate from Germany proposed that the conformity assessment results from the IEC CA Systems should be included in governmental bilateral and multilateral agreements. This will require that governments and regulators understand the value of including conformity assessment results in bilateral agreements which could be achieved through the efforts of the IEC National Committee members and members of CAB. CAB supports this proposal and has raised the topic with the IEC Council Board.\nCAB has also agreed that the CAB Secretariat will make a proposal to UNECE Working Party 6 for a recommendation to use IEC CA Systems as a regulatory and national quality infrastructure best practice tool.\nNew service offerings from IECEE\nAs industries digitalize, the uniformity of time sensitive networks (TSN) is becoming increasingly important. Currently several networks exist with their own networks and certification schemes, but they are not well recognized. IECEE, together with IEEE, would like to offer a new service for time sensitive networks based on the draft joint IEC/IEEE 60802 standard on time sensitive profile for industrial automation. CAB has approved that IECEE develop a proposal for this possible new service offering.\nIECEE has received a request from the UN for a service that would involve “partial conformity assessment”. The UN has identified cases where the requirements for standards compliance are overly stringent for some regions to be able to fully conform. As a result, the UN would like to have a programme allowing for the partial use of standards. Current IECEE principle calls for the testing of a product for conformity with the entirety of the standard. However, should there be a market need, such a request could be considered. CAB has called on IECEE to develop a concept for future new services, including partial conformity assessment of suitable aspects within specified standards, for CAB endorsement by October 2020.\nDuring discussions of new and existing collaborations with international organizations, such as ITU and UN U4E, it was realized that no general guidance for the IEC CA Systems exists on how to cooperate with other international organizations and what are the applicable IEC core principles that need to be considered. In particular, the responsibilities and the processes by which such cooperation will be set up, as well as the level of CAB involvement. Rules on how to set up cooperation with other organizations are currently lacking. As a result, CAB has decided that it will address this issue with the IEC Council Board since this relates to our valuable collaborations and cooperation with other International organizations.\nCyber security\nThe IEC Cybersecurity Ambassador, Wei Hao, presented his work for the IEC. One activity has included the developed of a landscape study which identifies the organizations that the IEC should target regarding the implementation of IEC Standards. A summary of the report will be provided to the IEC CO.\nCAB agreed to disband WG 17 on cybersecurity and to transfer the remaining tasks of WG 17 to IECEE WG 31 which is responsible for the IECEE cybersecurity program and includes the monitoring and liaison with the IECEx and IECQ cybersecurity activities.\nConcerning work with European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), CAB decided that the IEC CO should pursue an MoU between the IEC and ENSI. In addition, a designated expert from IECEE WG 31 should pursue membership in the ENISA ad-hoc group established to discuss a successor to the European certification system for cyber security known as SOG-IS Mutual Recognition Agreement.\nNew appointments\nCAB officially appointed the new Executive Secretary for IECEE and IECRE, Wolfram Zeitz, for a five years period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2024. This follows the retirement of the current IECRE and IECEE Executive Secretary Kerry McManama at the end of 2019.\nCAB appointed Paul Meanwell as the new Chair of IECEx for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022.\nThank you\nCAB thanked several members of CAB who will be leaving by the end of the year. Tim Duffy, Ian Forte, Thorsten Arnhold, Sandy Butterfield, Kerry McManama, Didier Bourgès and Steve Margis were recognized for their contribution to CAB.\nPrime Minister Commendation\nIn a special note, CAB congratulated Toshiyuki Kajiya for recently receiving the prestigious 2019 Japanese Prime Minister’s Commendations in recognition for his contribution to conformity assessment and International industrial standardization as well as the IEC CAB and IECEE."

These in turn have improved products and services in agriculture, business, finance, manufacturing, retail, transport. The list keeps growing and healthcare is no exception.\nArtificial technologies are helping save lives. For example, machine learning is being used to leverage patient data, customized dashboards display risk scores and send alerts to doctors if a patient is identified as being in the early stage of sepsis allowing rapid, effective treatment.\nThe Frost & Sullivan Global Digital Health Outlook 2020 predicts that the global digital healthcare market will be worth USD 234.5 billion by 2023. It also notes that this is driven particularly by the mobile health industry or mobile based medical devices.\nWireless technologies, affordable smartphones, improved 3G and 4G networks, increased use of mobile platforms, as well as convenience and lifestyle changes have all contributed to this trend.\nThe great concerns around personal data\nSo what is digital health? According to Wikipedia, it is the “convergence of digital technologies with health, healthcare, living, and society to enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery and make medicine more personalized and precise”.\nAs more countries digitalize healthcare systems and more people use connected medical devices, massive amounts of personal data are being gathered, stored and shared between diverse healthcare users and providers.\nWe read about the benefits of improving the quality of life for patients living with diabetes and cost effectiveness of self-monitoring, which reduces the need for visits to the doctor or hospital and allows the treatment of more urgent cases.\nWhat do you know about your medical digital files?\nBut what about the security of our personal data? Who is responsible for it? The medical device manufacturers or does it fall to the healthcare providers, such as hospitals? Or are patients who use self-monitoring devices responsible for ensuring their own data security? Have you ever wondered how and where the last digital scan you did was stored, if your doctor shared it with a colleague or if it was submitted for some sort of medical research?\nSafety through standards\nIEC expert, Georg Heidenreich, who is involved in the development of international standards for electrical equipment in medical practice, gave an interview in the IEC e-tech magazine, in which he discusses the different types of algorithms being used in medical devices and where the current responsibilities lie. He highlighted the role IEC is playing in helping to achieve safety and performance of such devices through standards and in particular, the urgent need to develop a one which addresses the management of data in terms of integrity and validity, and meets safety and performance goals that are the basis of regulatory market access for medical devices.\nRead the full interview."

        "content": "IEC Technical Committee 111, which prepares environmental standards for electrical and electronic products, has built a strong working relationship with China Quality Certification Centre (CQC), the largest professional certification body in China.\nIn addition to providing product and management system certification, CQC is a state-authorized third party certification body for energy and water saving as well as environmentally friendly products. The Centre is also a national certification body in the IEC Conformity Assessment programme IECEE.\n“CQC is an indispensable working partner for IEC TC 111. Its experts, whether from industry or various Chinese organizations, contribute to our different working groups. There are 35 participating Chinese members in TC 111, the highest number from any country. This involvement underlines the strong commitment from the Chinese government to international standards in world markets and especially relating to environmental aspects. It is no coincidence that standardization was the focal point of the 25th Yiwu International Fair which IEC TC 111 attended in October”, says Christophe Garnier IEC TC 111 Chair.\nInside TC 111, Chinese members have been leading the way on product category rules, which need to be established to ensure the environmental evaluation of similar products from different manufacturers can be compared. They are also investigating the possibility of harmonizing the criteria for ecolabels to help industry make the appropriate declarations.\n“We do our best to inform Chinese experts about IEC TC 111 work as well as let the world know about Chinese standardization work. We have sent more than 30 Chinese experts to take part in the development of all the technical documents developed by TC111 and we lead five of these developments. We transformed 17 IEC Standards and TRs regarding EE environmental aspects into Chinese standards. In addition, Chinese standards of hazardous substance testing were proposed as part of IEC 62321-12 (Determination of certain substances in electrotechnical products – Part 12: Simultaneous determination Polybrominated biphenyls, polybrominateddiphenyl ethers and phthalates in polymers by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)”, says Mingfei Luo, from CQC and head of Chinese TC 111 Mirror Committee.\n \n\n\nChristophe Garnier and Mingfei Luo at the IEC General Meeting in Shanghai\n\n \n“I am very glad to see that more and more stakeholders are attracted by TC 111 work. We are building links between the Chinese government, associations, institutions, companies, testing and certification bodies. As a result, there is an increasing awareness among them of the importance of standards. All these achievements can not be made without consistent support from TC 111 officers. We do hope that China will continue to play an important role in TC 111 work in the future,” she adds.\nIEC TC 111 presentation at the Yiwu Fair\nAn estimated 20 000 people attended the Yiwu Fair in Zhejiang Province, in eastern China, between 21 and 25 October. The Standardization Administration of China and the Ministry of Commerce co-hosted the event with the Zhejiang provincial authorities.\nParticipants comprised standards development organizations, including the IEC, and testing and certification bodies from China (including CQC), the United States and Europe, as well as 2000 companies from South Korea, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Italy and China.\nIEC TC 111 presented its key standards during the event, including the second edition of IEC of IEC 62474, which establishes the requirements for reporting the substances and materials included in electronic and electrical products.\nThe standard also facilitates the transfer and processing of this data by defining a common data format which applies to exchanges in the supply chain. It comes with a validated open database, which is an XML standardized declaration format for a list of substances, substance groups and common material classes."

This event brought together over 130 participants to discuss the latest updates on electrical installation regulations for buildings among the ASEAN member states.\nThis event is part of a wider initiative by the ASEAN Federation of Engineering Organisations (AFEO) to develop a baseline standard for the implementation of low-voltage electrical installations in buildings in order to facilitate the mobility of engineering technologies and services within ASEAN countries.\nThe initiative is based upon IEC 60364, a series of standards related to electrical wiring, including their safety and design and verification. AFEO set up the ASEAN Engineering Inspectorate – Electrical Installation (AEI-EI) to review areas such as terms and definitions, special location installation, verification and energy efficiency under IEC 60364.\nDuring the Symposium, speakers provided the latest updates on standards and regulations applicable in low voltage electrical installations within special locations. Updates were also shared on energy efficiency regulations and electrical installation codes in Malaysia. Dennis Chew, IEC Regional Director for the Asia-Pacific Centre, provided an overview of the IEC and encouraged participants to become involved in standards development.\nIn late 2015, ASEAN member-states formally established the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) which seeks to develop a highly integrated and cohesive economy among members. This requires the implementation of harmonized standards in order to remove the technical barriers to trade. The ASEAN Electrotechnical Symposium and Exhibition is part of this effort to integrate the economies among the ASEAN member states."

In 2018, 171 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity worldwide bringing total capacity to 2 351 GW in total, as noted in the IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics 2019 report.\nThis is positive news, as the world works toward reducing fossil fuel energy, however, there are many aspects to consider when developing large scale renewable energy production sites.\nThird party certification of wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and marine energy equipment and services to consensus-based international standards, supports manufacturers in the RE industry, by reducing risks, streamlining costs, as well as enhancing market access.\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, was established in 2014 to address these issues.\nCertification plays a key role in RE industry\nIECRE has recently issued a design certificate and a commissioning certificate for a PV power plant in China owned by the Shanghai ZPMC Electric Co., Ltd.\n“Large-scale renewable energy production is very complex and costly, so it is vital to ensure safety, reliability and suitability of location of the particular plant for all parties concerned, from the initial design phase through to the final disposal phase. IECRE issues certificates at different points of the development, which cover these aspects for the production of solar PV, wind and marine energy”, said Wolfram Zeitz, Secretary, IECRE.\nThere are four main phases in the lifecycle of PV plant: development, construction, exploitation and disposal.\nThe design certificate is issued for the development phase and is intended to cover the due diligence, usually of the developer, for the planning and design of a PV power plant, in other words, before the plant is built. It covers:\n\nVerifying all available documents and information and how the power plant is supposed to be set up, from site suitability to components or materials used.\nAre components such as PV modules and invertors to be certified\nWhat type of construction materials are going to be used, for example, wires, cables, connectors, distribution boxes etc.\nWhich company will be hired to install the plant, what qualifications they possess for this type of construction, as well as how to verify such qualifications.\n\n \nThe commissioning certificate is issued at the end of the construction phase, at the point that a plant is supposed to go into production, so that it may start working. This certificate is proof of verification that the construction of the plant has followed the design.\nOnce a plant begins production it will be subject to further checks, such as quality controls and annual performance certification to verify that the performance rate is not dropping.\nFind out more about IECRE"

        "content": "Large server networks are big consumers of electricity. Ways of making data centres more energy efficient and less power hungry are an important step in the fight to lower our global carbon emissions. IEC has developed a new metric which enables data centre managers to measure and compare the energy efficiency and the sustainability of data servers.\nISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, which was set up to prepare standards for information and communication technology (ICT), has established a subcommmittee, SC 39, which develops specifications on sustainability for and by IT. The SC is planning to publish a new standard which specifies a server energy efficiency metric (SEEM).\nJay Taylor, Chair of SC 39, explains why the metric is required:\n\n \n\nCollaboration with CENELEC\nSC 39 worked closely with the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC). “Mike Gilmore is the chair of TC 125 of CENELEC, which has produced the EN 50600 series of standards focused on data centre facility and infrastructure design and operation. His involvement was crucial. We had a big input from Finland, Germany, France, Ireland, Japan and China. In the US, we consulted with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Energy Commission“, Taylor says.\nTaylor explains how SEEM works:\n\n \n\nThe future standard – ISO/IEC 21836 – is expected to enable stakeholders to measure the energy effectiveness of servers before procurement and installation, particularly for use in worldwide server energy effectiveness regulations and programmes.\nThe standard permits users to compare the energy effectiveness across different server networks which previous key performance indicators (KPIs), as specified in the ISO/IEC 30134 series, did not do."

        "content": "The world’s first electric commercial aircraft has taken off from the Canadian city of Vancouver. The inaugural test flight lasted 15 minutes.\nThe DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver seaplane was retrofitted with a 750hp electric motor. However, it will be at least two years before the owners can electrify their whole fleet and launch a commercial service.\nBefore then they will need to compete more test flights to ensure the electric motor is safe and reliable. They will also need regulatory approval for the zero-emissions plane.\nThe maximum range possible for the Canadian plane is currently only 160km and battery power is one of its biggest challenges. Liquid fuel is not only much lighter than batteries on take off, but a plane also becomes lighter as it burns fuel.  \nLithium-ion batteries, of the kind that powered the aircraft flown in Vancouver, have the best power-to-weight ratio. They are prone to overheating, however.\nIEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems are crucial for establishing and testing the safety specifications and performance requirements for batteries, whether lead-acid, nickel-cadmium (NICad) or lithium-ion. IEC TC 21 is one of several IEC technical committees preparing standards for cells and batteries.\nThe work of IEC TC 21 is divided into two distinct areas covering different battery technologies. Subcommittee 21A has the task of preparing standards for batteries with alkaline electrolyte, such as NiCad or nickel–metal-hydride, and TC 21 focuses on batteries with acid electrolyte called lead-acid. Both share the work on Li-ion batteries.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four CA systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances of batteries, chargers and charging stations.\nResearchers are working on electric aircraft prototypes and have already pioneered the take-off of a hydrogen fuel cell four-seater aircraft. The IEC has been paving the way for electric fuel cell applications through the work of IEC TC 105 on fuel cell technologies.\nTC 105 develops international standards for fuel cell technologies. TC 105 has developed the IEC 62282 series of standards covers safety, performance and interchangeability of fuel cell power systems.\nMost recently, it developed IEC 62282-4-102 to provide performance test methods for fuel cell power systems used in certain industrial electric trucks and IEC 62282-5-100 which covers the construction, marking and test requirements for portable fuel cell power systems."

        "content": "A new Joint Advisory Group (JAG) has been set up to facilitate cooperation between IEC TC 100, IEC TC 124 and IEC SyC AAl. Johannes Koch from the IEC National Committee for Germany, DKE, is the new chair for this group.\nIn an interview with the DKE editorial team, Johannes Koch provides insight about the project and its aims.\nWhat is the Joint Advisory Group and why has it been founded?\nThe IEC created the Joint Advisory Group (JAG) as a platform for the structured and cross-domain exchange of ideas between two technical committees and one systems committee:\n\nTC 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment\nTC 124: Wearable electronic devices and technologies\nSyC AAL: Active assisted living.\n\n \nWith digital interfaces, innovative technologies already offer numerous solutions for a wide range of domains which previously had very few overlaps with one another, and which mean industry boundaries will disappear in the future.\nCommunication technologies can, for example, be used in the entertainment industry and even in the health sector. Both domains place very different regulatory and safety-related requirements on the same technology.\nThis so-called convergence of technology also has an increasing effect on national, European and international standardization. Companies must increasingly acquire knowledge in adjacent domains outside of their own core competencies, as do standards bodies who need to rethink and continue to develop existing platforms and committee structures.\nWhat example of overlaps from the everyday occurs to you?\nLet’s take the example of a smart watch. A smart watch is predominately identified as a traditional wearable, for which an established foundation for standardization and regulation already exists. However, wearables offer users ever more functions, creating an overlap with the health sector.\nThis may be the case, for example, if an older person or someone with support needs, wears a smart watch on their wrist which is connected to an emergency call system and automatically reports a fall via built-in sensors. Here, two use cases overlap which should also be covered in standardization. The use of graphic or audiovisual components thus again illustrates the useful cooperation and technical discussion between TC 100, TC 124 and SyC AAL.\nWhat aims will the Joint Advisory Group pursue?\nThe first JAG project will begin on the topics of “terminology” and “use cases”. It will first be clarified as to whether uniform terms are currently used in standardization or whether contradictory terminology exists. This intention essentially forms the basis for all future JAG activities. At the same time, we of course want to deal with the existing use cases and determine the content overlaps of the three committees.\nIt is the first time that experts from different IEC committees – outside of normal liaisons – have exchanged documents with one another. In the future, JAG will be able to discuss applications for standards and projects to ensure their best possible processing. It is especially important for us to emphasize that the competences of the TCs will not be restricted by the JAG in any way!\nOne of the most essential aims of the JAG is, with the help of structured information exchange, to define mutual activity areas and projects in order to align the standardization to the requirements and developments of the different markets. If everything works in the way we hope, the JAG could be viewed as “best practice” within the IEC.\nYou have been selected to be the chair of the Joint Advisory Group – what are your key tasks?\nAs chair of JAG, I have the opportunity to push forward the cooperation between the international committees. The DKE has always broken new ground in standardization and has established new formats, both national and internationally, so we are staying true to tradition.\nFor me, that really means keeping in close contact with the respective TC chairs and regularly inviting them to web conferences in which all international experts from the three committees can take part. In addition, the JAG set up a working meeting at the 83rd IEC General Meeting 2019 in Shanghai with the aim of establishing processes and responsibilities in terms of dynamic and quick standardization. We will therefore aim to hold a working meeting like this at the IEC general meetings in the coming years.\nThe interview originally appeared on the DKE website."

        "content": "The next generation of wireless telecommunications is set to transform the way we live and work. 5G networks promise higher speeds, lower latency and greater capacity is available with the current 4G system. In an often-repeated example, it will only take 3.6 seconds to download a two-hour movie compared with the current 6 minutes using the 4G network.\n5G networks are expected to unlock the potential for new applications. Sensors can be accommodated as can the responsiveness necessary for advanced IoT applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. Combined with edge computing, data analytics and machine learning, many believe that 5G will generate new business opportunities.\nBackhaul fibre support\nBackhaul support provided by fibre cables is an essential element for mobile broadband networks. According to the consultancy firm Deloitte, wireline broadband access supports up to 90% of all Internet traffic despite the fact that the majority of the traffic ends on a wireless device.\nAs the demand for mobile data expands, backhaul capacity must increase accordingly. And, in the case of 5G networks, the reliance on wireline broadband will be extensive. As noted by Deloitte, “unlocking the full potential of 5G rests on a key assumption: the extension of fibre deep into the network”.\nThe physical properties of fibre optics permit the transmission of data over long distances, with greater security and at higher data rates compared with traditional copper cables. And because they are immune to electromagnetic interferences, fibre optics can be used in various environments safely, including those with high radiation, without altering the transmission.\nClean fibres\nAs new fibre networks are installed for 5G or existing networks maintained, service providers will need to ensure that the fibre networks are cleaned and any contamination removed. This is essential to ensure network performance and reliability.\nFor example, connections and splices must be kept clean to avoid such problems as weakened signal, back reflection – when the signal is diverted back to its source – or a system shutdown. A contaminated connector or splice can block the light through the fibre and thus change the path of the signal or the index of refraction.\nGiven that 5G networks operate on higher frequency ranges compared to other mobile networks, they are more sensitive to the angle of refraction. Contamination can easily become a vulnerability.\nThe IEC published IEC 61300-3-35 which provides methods for assessing the quality of fibre optic connectors in each of the different zones of the fibre cable. For example, the core of the fiber, where the signal travels through, has the most stringent quality requirements.\nUsing IEC 61300-3-35 for measurement and inspection is considered an essential element for determining the performance of a fibre network.\nStandardizing fibre optics\nInternational standards provide safety and performance assurances. They establish minimum requirements for systems, devices and components to ensure product functionality across various manufacturers and provide test methods to evaluate performance and durability.\nIEC Technical Committee 86 prepares international standards for fibre optic systems, modules, devices and components intended for use with communications equipment. Its subcommittee on fibre optic interconnecting devices and passive components, IEC SC 86B, developed IEC 61300-3-35"

According to the UN, it is the opportunity to draw attention to the work achieved by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) “in helping States to cooperate and realize a truly global rapid transit network at the service of all mankind.”\nAccording to ICAO, total CO2 emissions from aviation represent approximately 2 % of global greenhouse gas emissions at present and this is expected to increase to 3 or 4% in line with the growth of air travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts a doubling of air travellers over the next twenty years.\nCan this surge be mitigated? Technology advances and a number of renewable energy initiatives aim to improve the track record of air transport. But it is unlikely that they will suffice.\nTechnology breakthroughs and incremental advances\nOn the technology front, all-electric aircraft are still at the concept stage and so are hydrogen fuel cell carriers. Small prototypes have been flown over short distances. IEC Technical Committee 105 paves the way for electric fuel cell applications, in all forms of transport. IEC TC 107 develops process management standards on systems and equipment used in the field of avionics.\nSome hybrid electric aeroplanes are already used, for regional air travel. New materials and designs are being devised to render aircraft lighter and thus use less fuel. IEC TC 113: Nanotechnology for electrotechnical products and systems, is preparing standards for new materials which could be used to make aircraft weigh less.\nA number of incremental and energy efficiency measures are being introduced, such as LEDs in airports and for aeronautical ground lighting (AGL).\nIEC TC 34 prepares standards for all forms of lights and lighting systems, including LEDs. IEC TC 97: Electrical installations for lighting and beaconing of aerodromes, is a pioneer in the development of standards for constant current circuit systems for AGL which are particularly adapted to LEDs.\nQuite a few airports are powered by renewable energy systems, whether solar, wind or hydro.

        "content": "Smart cities can benefit from the widespread use of data and technology. However, in order to leverage the benefit of new technologies, standards are needed. Not only do they allow for the provision of competitively priced and effective products and services but they also provide clear descriptions of best practice and enable common approaches to tackling common challenges.\nStandards are already vital to cities used for energy grids, lighting, transport and city services. The IEC has identified over 1800 standards that already impact smart cities.\nThe IEC has taken a systems approach with the aim of providing a holistic approach to address complex situations. The Chair of SyC Smart Cities, Michael Mulquin has recently published an article in the IET Smart Cities Journal which provides a thorough overview of the work of the IEC in supporting effective smart city standardization, including an update on the current work items.\nDefining a smart city\nMulquin begins by defining a smart city as a “city where improvements in quality of life, services, sustainability and resilience are accelerated by the widespread and transformative use of data and technology”.\nHe notes that a smart city is not only about incremental improvements to the current ways of doing things but rather about the implementation of new and better ways of doing so. Mulquin considers it to be about “transformational change”.\nThe challenge of developing smart city standards\nThe development of smart city standards can help cities all over the world to benefit more quickly and effectively from global best practice. It can also provide new and profitable opportunities for industry.\nIn his article, Mulquin group the standards used by cities into three categories:\n\nbasic standards that help cities work,\nnew standards that support incremental improvements, and,\nbig picture standards that focus on citywide transformation.\n\n\nHowever, many challenges exist in the development of such standards. They include the uniqueness of cities, the need to address the requirements of different stakeholders and the fact that cities are complicated systems of systems.\nMulquin also notes that a smart solution developed within any one of layer of the city will most likely require a change in some or all of the others layers. No solution developed within one of these layers will work unless the required changes in the other layers are also addressed.\nWork of the IEC\nThe IEC has developed many standards that are important for the efficient functioning of cities. However, rather than addressing each of these standards in isolation, the IEC developed a systems approach to smart city standards.\nAccording to Mulquin, a systems approach can be defined as “as a holistic, iterative, discovery process that helps by first defining the right problems in complex situations and then by finding elegant, well-designed and workable solutions. It incorporates not only engineering, but also human and social aspects”.\nThe SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of various IEC committees as well as other groups such as ISO with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems.\nWhile SyC Smart Cities may develop some systems standards, such as frameworks or use cases, its most important role is to bring the expertise of the 20,000 IEC experts to help solve the problems of cities, and to collaborate with other standards development organizations to develop coherent packages of city standards."

There is a great need to provide services so that the disabled can live healthy, active and independent lives.\nThe United Nations has declared 3 December as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The theme this year focuses on the empowerment of persons with disabilities for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development. IEC Standards help improve the lives of those with disabilities and enable their active participation in the public sphere.\nThe IEC, through its Systems Committee for Active Assisted Living (SyC AAL), works on providing AAL solutions for people with disabilities. Additionally, the work of several IEC Technical Committees (TCs) also helps to address specific needs.\nVisually impaired\nICT equipment already includes software solutions, such as optical character recognition, character magnification or voice recognition systems and hardware including adapted or on-screen keyboards.\nVisually impaired users can also use an innovative colour ID app to ‘see’ what colour any item is, by holding the smart phone in front of it. They can coordinate their wardrobe, check if a piece of fruit is ripe, or choose the right lipstick. Other systems can translate voice to text or reproduce sign language for those with impaired hearing.  \nTV services have become more accessible to the blind and visually impaired by explaining what is happening on screen, using the gaps in dialogue and audio description. \nIEC TC 100: Audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment, has set up Technical Area 16: AAL, accessibility and user interfaces. It has developed tools, such as the optical character recognition, character magnification or voice recognition systems and hardware including adapted or on-screen keyboards.\nLiquid level indicators can help by beeping when a cup is nearly full, enabling visually impaired people to do something as simple as make a cup of tea without scalding themselves.  IEC TC 47: Semiconductor devices, produces standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of sensors as well as for measuring and testing methods.\nHearing loss\nHearing aids are an essential tool in helping those suffering from hearing loss with an estimated 8 million of such devices manufactured each year. IEC TC 29 is responsible for developing standards related to hearing aid performance, specification and measurement. It has also developed standards which allow wearers of specially equipped hearing aids to have a wireless signal transmitted directly to their ear in places like museums or theatres.\nTC 29 has recently published the fifth edition of IEC 60118-13, which is a fundamental standard for manufacturers of hearing aids as it specifies the requirements and methods of measurement for electromagnetic (EM) immunity to mobile digital wireless devices.\nSmart alarm systems and smoke detectors adapted for people with hearing impairments alert users by flashing intermittently, or, if the person is lying down, by vibrating (under a pillow or mattress). The wireless transmitters in some of these systems can also connect to home security systems, videophones or the doorbell and send alerts from these.\nIEC TC 79: Alarm and electronic security systems, prepares International Standards for a wide range of applications and systems including electronic access control, alarm transmission, video surveillance, fire detection and fire alarm systems, and remote receiving and/or surveillance centres. Its work also covers interoperability between different services."

        "content": "According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), around one in four people in the world is affected by a form of mental disorder.\nThe medical profession is increasingly resorting to virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to treat mental illness. Virtual reality is used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and paranoia syndromes as well as depression.\nVirtual war zones\nVR technology has been successfully used as a treatment for war veterans who, equipped with headsets, revisit the dangerous zones they were deployed in, for instance. Depression and anxiety can be soothed by enabling patients to experience a particularly pleasant and relaxing environment. For example, a VR programme allowing people to virtually swim in the sea with dolphins has been successfully implemented in some Californian hospitals to help patients who feel depressed.\nIEC has formed a joint technical committee with ISO, JTC 1, which prepares standards for information technology. One of its subcommittees publishes documents which specify the requirements for augmented reality (AR) and VR. IEC TC 110 publishes standards for electronic displays. One of its working groups has developed the first edition of IEC 63145-20-20, which establishes the measurement conditions for determining the image quality of eyewear displays.\nPredicting suicidal tendencies\nHigh-powered machine learning algorithms can be used to detect patterns of behaviour revealing depression and suicidal tendencies. A report, produced by scientists at USC, Carnegie Mellon University, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, investigates non-verbal facial expressions in order to detect suicidal risks. It claims to have found a pattern that differentiates depressed and suicidal patients. The dataset used in the research comprises interviews with subjects from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and the Princeton Community Hospital.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 prepares standards for AI. IEC is also a co-founder of the Open Community for Ethics in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (OCEANIS), which deals with key ethical issue relating to AI.\nWhile we are not quite there yet, vocal assistants in our mobile phones are expected, at some point in the near future, to detect suicidal tendencies by the sound of our voices or what we say, even in a cryptic fashion. And once they have detected these tendencies, they could give the right sort of advice. We all know how useful smartphones have become in our daily lives. In a few years from now, they might even play an active part in saving peoples’ lives. Read more in: Mind games"

        "content": "Cloud computing is one of the hot topics in the IT industry. Along with artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, it is part of the trifecta of digital technologies that are predicted to transform our lives.\nTo enable the standardization of cloud computing at the international level, the IEC and ISO joint technical committee on IT set up a subcommittee in this area: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38. The Chair of this subcommittee, Steve Holbrook, provides his thoughts on the definition of cloud computing, the role of international standards, innovations and data flows.\nDefining cloud computing\nAccording to Holbrook, cloud computing is a new paradigm in the area of distributed processing. It is the most efficient method that has been developed that allows for the shared use of resources – computing resources, storage resources and network resources – that are essential for computing.\n\n\n\n \n \nRole of international standards\nInternational standards are essential for eliminating technical barriers to trade. They allow for services in the cloud to be made available to others regardless of the country where they originated.\n\n\n\n \n \nInnovation in cloud computing\nHolbrook notes that much innovation is taking place in cloud computing is in the open source community. New notions, such as Dockers and Kubernetes container management, have been introduced and are affecting how services are delivered on the Internet.\n\n\n\n \n \nManaging data flows\nStandards can help in defining how data flows from devices to cloud services and the responsibilities of each party.\n\n\n\nSocial Share"

        "content": "IEC Technical Committee 106 has published the first edition of IEC 62209-3, a standard which considerably speeds up the measurement of radio frequency (RF) fields from wireless communication devices.\nA mobile phone has both transmitter and receiver sections. When a mobile device is operating, it emits radio waves that consist of radio frequency (RF) energy, a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation moving at the speed of light. It works by transmitting radio wave signals to, and receiving these from, nearby base stations.\nFears that these RF fields could affect our health have prompted legislators to set limits. Many countries around the world have adopted guidelines set by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These guidelines refer to a specific absorption rate (SAR), a measure of the rate at which EM is absorbed by the human body, when exposed to radio waves. This happens when we use a mobile phone, for example.\nIEC TC 106 standardizes the methods for the assessment of electric, magnetic and EM fields associated with human exposure. IEC 62209-3 establishes a novel measurement procedure for the assessment of the SAR of human exposure to RF fields from wireless communication devices.\nIt sets specifications for fast SAR measurement systems, using a vector-probe array solution. This system determines the 3D EM field, by using a 3D reconstruction algorithm in a phantom, a sort of mannequin or physical model of the human body.\n“This type of testing would take around five weeks using traditional measurement methods. Vector-based measurement enables manufacturers to carry it out in less than half a day, which saves a considerable amount of time and money as well”, says Jafar Keshvari, who leads the project team that produced the standard.\nRead more:\nNew ground-break standard saves time and money"

        "content": "I recently returned from Shanghai, where I attended the IEC Young Professional Programme for the second time, this year returning as a 2018 Young Professional Leader.\nAs I’m sure is true for many attendees, I’m always sad when the event ends and we say goodbye to our new friends, a wonderful country, and return to the real world – but one of the highlights of coming home is receiving photos from the event. This photo is one of my favourites! Here, I’m walking with my fellow 2018 YP Leaders, Xun Gong and Frank Bakker, getting ready to welcome the new YPs during the Welcome Reception.\nReturning this year was an opportunity to reflect on what I had learned through the Programme over the past year as well as how it has impacted me, both personally and professionally. First and foremost, participating in the Programme taught me about the IEC’s processes and challenges.\nAdditionally, it also drove home an important, but more subtle lesson in diversity: of background, discipline, gender, and region, while not yet perfectly balanced in the IEC, is valued highly, and many efforts are ongoing to improve the diversity of the organization. In fact, this was my promise to the YPs as I nominated myself for YP Leader in 2018, and it resonated, as I was elected.\nIn addition to understanding how the IEC functions, there are many opportunities for YPs and YP Leaders to practise and refine “soft skills” – the ability to communicate to an international audience, feeling comfortable presenting to a large group of people, and knowing when to give a group in the middle of a contentious discussion a coffee break.\nBeing able to practise these skills has made me more comfortable in front of a room and willing to take on leadership positions both in the US National Committee and in my career – but the benefits of this programme don’t end with professional development.\nWithout the IEC Young Professional Programme, I would never have come to my current (and ever evolving) understanding of the role of standards and conformity assessment in sustainability, safety, and global trade.\nI wouldn’t have the global perspective or insights provided by my colleagues on politics and trends around the world, and I while I always knew that international collaboration was important, I now realize it is integral to solving any complex and wide-reaching challenge.\nI wouldn’t have been able to visit wonderful countries and learn more about our neighbors across the world – and most importantly, I wouldn’t have made the wonderful friends I have now.\nThough my tenure as a Young Professional Leader has ended, my involvement in the standards and conformity assessment has just begun – and it all started with the IEC Young Professionals Programme.\n \n____________________________________________________________\n \n\nAbout the Author\nCarrie Schmaus is an ORISE Science, Technology, and Policy Fellow at the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and a 2018 Young Professional Leader at the IEC.

During this year’s annual meeting, we were able to rejuvenate our structure to ensure faster decisions processes in the future while maintaining the consensus-based involvement of our stakeholders”, said Wolfram Zeitz, Deputy Secretary of IECRE.\nInstilling confidence in renewables through certification\nThird party certification of wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and marine energy equipment and services, to consensus-based international standards, supports manufacturers in the RE industry, by reducing risks, streamlining costs, as well as enhancing market access.\nIECRE covers three sectors: marine, solar PV, and wind. The system was established in 2014 to address these issues, in a world with growing electricity demands, which at the same time, needs to reduce power generated by fossil fuels.\nDuring the event, Bernhard Zangerl, CEO of Bachmann electronic commented on the different benefits of IECRE certification to international standards:\n“Industrial companies benefit tremendously from globally certified standards. Not only do they raise industry standards, they also facilitate international trade. We only have to certify our products once, eliminating the need for duplicate evaluations and certifications, thus reducing costs for both consumers and manufacturers.”\nWith regard to making renewable energy production more efficient, he noted: “Certification also improves profitability by making the supply of energy from the plant to the grid much more reliable, which in turn lowers the overall cost of energy production, further enabling the global transition to renewables.”"

        "content": "Trains, trams and metros are rightly perceived to be more environmentally friendly than other forms of transport. There is a still a lot they can do, however, to become even greener.\nNew technologies and processes are being investigated in a drive to provide more sustainable rail-based transport systems. IEC Technical Committee 9 prepares standards for trains, metros and other light rail systems. It has issued around 100 publications and assesses the need to include energy efficiency requirements in its standards on an ongoing basis.\nA number of energy efficient technologies, essentially relating to energy harvesting techniques, are starting to be used by various operators around the world. Regenerative braking, a mechanism by which the electric motor uses the vehicle’s momentum to recover energy that would be otherwise lost to the brake discs as heat, is widely used by trains and metros.\nThis energy harvesting (EH) technique enables extra energy to be used immediately for powering air conditioning devices, for instance, or to be stored for later use. Some railways even feed the excess energy produced into the power grid.\nOther forms of EH techniques involve piezoelectric energy (i.e. an electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials in response to applied mechanical stress). In Israel, a company has installed piezoelectric pads on railway tracks which generate energy when trains drive over these pads. The energy produced can then power trackside lights and other electrical items.\nIs hydrogen one of the answers?\nAlongside global efforts to reduce diesel and gas-powered electric engines by gradually replacing them with all-electric engines, some operators are looking at hydrogen as a substitute source of energy. One of Europe’s largest rail manufacturers demonstrated what it claims is the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, a very clean form of electricity production that does not involve any generation of emissions at all, other than water vapour.\nIn China, one of the state-owned railway corporations launched a commercial fuel cell-powered tram. IEC TC 105: Fuel cell technologies, prepares standards for fuel cells used in transport.\nRead more about IEC Standards and trains, metros and trams in the briefing paper: Smart train, metro and tramway systems."

I am observing something similar at the IEC/IEEE meeting this week in Tokyo.\nOur global experts are aiming to move forward with the next phase of 5G mmWave EMF testing standards. The annual plenary is reviewing the strategy and sharing the results of the past year, when IEC/IEEE standards have supported the recent 5G launches globally.\n\n\n \n\nOn Tuesday, the IEC/IEEE team were guests at a Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology workshop on human exposure assessment and related standardization activities.  The workshop enabled very positive information exchanges.\nThe dialogue between a wide range of stakeholders ultimately helped to deliver more efficient standards and provided valuable information on 5G and EMF assessments.  Striving for excellence and delivering quality and useful standards are key elements that drive our joint teams. \nThis is the backbone of the culture we have developed, where we can share ideas, challenge each other, learn and feed this into the global standards from the IEC and IEEE. Our teams are delivering amazing results that will benefit all and deliver a safer, more efficient world.\nI’d like to end by saying a big thank you to the Japanese National Committee and NICT for their hospitality and the very positive meeting experience.  \n______________________________________________\n \n\nAbout the Author\nMike Wood is Chairman of IEC Technical Committee (TC) 106, which prepares International Standards on measurement and calculation methods to assess human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields.

        "content": "During the IEC General Meeting, which took place from October 21 until October 25 in Shanghai, Luca Mari, Chair of IEC Technical Committee 1, and IEC Terminology Coordinator Joanna Goodwin, organized a workshop on “The revised SI and its impact on the IEC”.\nErik Jacobson, Convenor of IEC TC 1/WG 100, Srinath Rajagopal, researcher at the National Physical Laboratory (NTL) in the UK, and Pierre Sebellin, IEC Technical Department Manager also contributed to the workshop.\nParticipants discussed the role of international standards vis-à-vis the revised International System of Units (SI). The changes to the SI were unanimously approved during the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in November 2018.\nThe definitions of all base units are now explicitly based on constant quantities. The kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin, and the mole, in particular, are defined by setting exact numerical values for the Planck constant (h), the elementary electric charge (e), the Boltzmann constant (k), and the Avogadro constant (NA) respectively.\nThe new definitions aim to improve the universality and the stability of the SI, while ensuring continuity of existing instrument calibrations and measurement results. The numerical values of the defining constants have been carefully chosen so as to guarantee that the new definitions identify the same quantities as before.\nIn particular, the “1948 ampere” – which was when the previous definition of the ampere was agreed – and the “2019 ampere”, although defined in a completely different way, are substantially the same intensity of electric current.\nIn a presentation on the implementation of the revised SI in IEC Standards, Mari highlighted the important role played by technical standards in connecting the metrological system with our society. “The definitions of the units in the revised SI are complex, hard to understand by non physicists and phrased in a peculiar way.\n“The IEC Electropedia and IEC Standards in general need to include definitions of the SI that are in conformity with the 2018 CGPM resolution, but that are also terminologically correct and as understandable as possible to standard writers and users, textbook writers and the general public”, he said.\nTerminology is crucial in helping to make the revised SI understandable to as wide an audience as possible. “One of the issues is to guarantee that different persons use the same term, for example measurement, with the same meaning. The solution is to agree on a definition based on the concept of measurement,” he added.\nThe SI Brochure, the document, published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), to officially present the SI, references the ISO and IEC 80000 quantities and units series.\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\nThe weight is over as scientists redefine the kilogram"

        "content": "The IEC Systems Committee on Smart Energy has published a new Technology Report on best practices for protecting the electric grid against cyber attacks. Cyber security and resilience guidelines for the smart energy operational environment is the work of a group of top international experts brought together by the IEC Systems Committee on Smart Energy. Frances Cleveland, who leads the group, presented the report at the recent IEC General Meeting in Shanghai.\nThe IEC advocates a holistic approach to building cyber resilience, combining best practices with testing and certification. A holistic approach incorporates not only technology and processes, but also and especially people. “People going about their normal operational duties are the biggest threat,” says IEC cyber security expert Frances Cleveland.\n“It’s important to realize that even when you have cyber security implemented and training, you still have to worry about the insider and in particular, the disgruntled employee. She or he has knowledge of the company, passwords and critical power system processes.”\nThe new IEC Technology Report outlines five critical concepts for addressing cyber security. They are: resilience; security by design; the fundamental importance of understanding the difference between information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT); risk assessment, risk mitigation, and continuous update of processes; and the role of international standards.\nIEC Technology Report\nProtecting our critical infrastructure is essential. Such is our reliance on the efficient and continuous supply of power that any loss of electricity would carry heavy implications for a wide range of vital services. The new IEC report advocates using a risk-based systems approach based on best practices, as well as the ability to demonstrate the effective and efficient implementation of the security measures.\nThis means combining the right international standards with conformity assessment to assess the components of the system, the competencies of the people designing, operating and maintaining it, and the processes and procedures used to run it. In a world where cyber threats are becoming increasingly common, being able to apply a specific set of international standards combined with a dedicated and worldwide certification programme, is a proven and highly effective approach to ensuring long-term cyber resilience.\nIt may appear as the third concept in the report but the fundamental advice, which arguably underpins everything else, is that in order to be effective security measures must encompass both IT and OT — information and operational technologies. Cleveland puts it more succinctly: “Cyber is very tightly intertwined with engineering. They shouldn’t be viewed as separate.” \nRead more: The five pillars of cyber security\nYou can download Cyber security and resilience guidelines for the smart energy operational environment here."

The event was hosted by the Japanese National Body.\n“AI continues to fuel the digital transformation, which will in turn change how we live, work and play for generations to come”, said Wael William Diab, who chairs SC 42. “SC 42 is developing projects and studying emerging areas across the entire ecosystem”.\nStandards in the pipeline\nOver 50% of the SC 42 programme of work has now moved past the initial working draft state, with the Big Data Reference Architecture moving into final balloting. International standards projects moving to the next stage of development included:\nAI ecosystem projects\n\nISO/IEC 22989 Concepts and terminology\nISO/IEC 23053 Framework for AI systems using machine learning\nISO/IEC 24030 AI Use Cases\nISO/IEC 24029-1 Assessment of robustness of neural networks Part 1: Overview\n\n \nBig Data ecosystem projects\n\nISO/IEC 20547-1 Big data reference architecture – Part 1: framework and application process\nISO/IEC 20547-3 Big data reference architecture – Part 3: reference architecture\n\n \nNew areas of study initiated\nTo address emerging areas of interest and challenges in the broad adoption of AI, SC42 established two new Advisory Groups:\n\nSC 42/AG 1 AI Management Systems Standard (MSS) is tasked with preparing a justification study which identifies the elements and substantiates the viability of a management systems standard. AI technologies present concerns beyond traditional IT systems such ethical and trustworthy considerations in the training data used. A potential MSS can allow for assessment of the AI processes used. The Group will submit its report at the next SC 42 Plenary in April 2020.\n\t \nAn AI Systems Engineering Advisory Group was set up to carry out, among other things, a gap analysis between existing engineering practices and AI best practices to identify standardization opportunities. The group will also study system engineering challenges unique to AI systems such as adaptation, integration, lifecycle implications, redeployment and maintenance.\n\nMore liaisons\nSC 42 covers the entire AI ecosystem with an extensive network of liaisons that include many committees within JTC 1, IEC and ISO. It also collaborates with external groups. During the meeting, liaisons were approved with ITU-T, Partnership on AI (PAI), ISO TC 37/SC 3 Management of terminology and IEC TC 65/SC 65A System aspects of industrial-process measurement, control and automation. SC 42 is inviting all its liaison partners to submit relevant use cases on artificial intelligence.\nMore about the committee for AI\nSC 42 has published three standards, has 13 open projects and six working groups. It is comprised of 29 participating members and 12 observing members. Over 150 delegates and 170 experts attended the Plenary in Tokyo.\nDiab thanked the event host on behalf of the committee – Japanese National Body as well as the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI), Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) and the Information Technology Standards Commission of Japan (ITSCJ). He also acknowledged the meeting sponsors – National institute of advanced industrial science and technology (AIST), Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NEC Corporation, Hitachi Ltd and Microsoft Japan."

        "content": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss. It may result from genetic causes, complications at birth, certain infectious diseases, chronic ear infections, the use of particular drugs, exposure to excessive noise and ageing. The organization estimates that by 2050 over 900 million people – or one in every ten people – will have disabling hearing loss.\nHearing loss may be mild, moderate, severe or profound. It can affect one or both ears and leads to difficulty in hearing conversational speech or loud sounds. “Hard of hearing” refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. People who are hard of hearing usually communicate through spoken language and can benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices.\nMost modern hearing aids contain digital signal processors and wireless transceivers which can be affected by electromagnetic radio waves emitted by mobile phones. This is called electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can result in a degradation of audio quality and the addition of popping, clicking or noticeable gaps in the audio, and even a buzzing noise. This can happen either while people are using their mobiles or are in the vicinity of GSM-based devices.\nIEC expertise handy for assistive listening devices\nIEC produces international standards for hearing aids, which, like any other medical devices sold around the world, need to meet the strictest performance and safety requirements. IEC Technical Committee 29 has developed many key publications in this particular area. It has recently published the fifth edition of IEC 60118-13, which is a fundamental standard for manufacturers of hearing aids as it specifies the requirements and methods of measurement for electromagnetic (EM) immunity to mobile digital wireless devices.\n“Working Group 13 of TC 29 has built a a strong relationship with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) over the last ten years. This ongoing cooperation has resulted in the fifth edition of the IEC 60118-13 standard which specifies hearing aid positioning and EM field strengths consistent with those established in the ANSI publication which is also published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)”, explains Gert Ravn who leads the working group.\n“More than 1000 hearing aids have been measured since the first edition of IEC 60118-13 and these measurements have demonstrated that the field strength levels specified in the standard are sufficiently high to ensure that hearing aids are well functioning for every day use”, he adds."

        "content": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 422 million people in the world suffer from diabetes. It is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by high levels of blood sugar, which can lead over time to serious damage of the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body doesn’t make enough insulin. In the past three decades, the prevalence of this type of diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels.\nNew drugs and breakthroughs in dosing and delivery systems have quite literally revolutionized the treatment of diabetes over the last few years. The 2008 Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines emphasize the need to use a wide range of medications, health care providers, and patient motivation strategies to keep blood glucose under control.\nOne of these breakthroughs is wearable glucose sensors. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a tiny sensor inserted under your skin, usually on your stomach or arm. The sensor measures your interstitial blood sugar levels, which is the glucose found in the fluid between the cells. The sensor tests glucose every few minutes. A transmitter wirelessly sends the information to a monitor, which can be a mobile phone. Much handier and user friendly than pricking your finger and using a paper stick which was the way people routinely monitored their diabetes until recently.\nAn alarm can sound when your glucose level goes too low or too high. You can note your meals, physical activity, and medicines in a CGM device, too, alongside your glucose levels. You can download data to a computer or smart device to more easily see your glucose trends. Parents can monitor children with a mobile phone.\nThe first edition of IEC 60747-14-10 “specifies the terms, definitions, symbols, tests, and performance evaluation methods used to determine the performance characteristics of wearable electrochemical-glucose sensors for practical use.” The international standard is published by IEC TC 47 which prepares documents relevant to sensor technology. It is expected to be published in November."

        "content": "The United Nations had designated 31 October as World Cities Day. This year, the UN has selected the theme of Changing the world: innovations and better life for future generations with the aim of increasing awareness on how digital innovations can be used for urban service delivery to enhance the quality of life and improve the urban environment.\nAs stated by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, “Let us commit to embracing innovation to ensure a better life for future generations and chart a path towards sustainable, inclusive urban development that benefits all”.\nSmart cities can offer the tools to improve the quality of life in cities. According to Michael Mulquin, Chair of the IEC Systems Committee on Smart cities (SyC Smart cities), they can be defined as cities where improvements in quality of life, city services, sustainability and resilience are accelerated by the widespread and transformative use of data and technology. A smart city understands how to use data and technology efficiently and effectively in order to improve the quality of life for everyone living in the city.\nImportance of standards\nData and technology open up great possibilities but they also expose us to potential risk and real damage. Mulquin explains that standards are needed not only for new technologies and new ways of using data but also on how to manage the whole eco-system to make sure that life is safe and secure for the people who live in the city.\nStandards can help. According to Mulquin, standards are often considered to be about products and process. But they also provide a clear description of agreed best practices. As Mulquin noted, they offer “a common solution for a mutual problem”.\nStandards can also accelerate the move to smarter cities through economies of scale. Mulquin noted that “standards build scale. Many cities implementing the same things will lead to cheaper and better products”. City planners do not need to worry about being locked into a single vendor or that different technologies will not work together.\nAccording to Mulquin, “standards offer a consensus-based approach to identifying workable solutions”.  They are considered objective and unbiaised, offering solutions that are trusted. And, with input from city planners, industry and academia, they represent the interest of all parties involved.\nStandards can also provide definitions and frameworks to help smart city planners communicate. Mulquin noted, “they define the key things and concepts within a domain and show their relationships with each other. They help me understand the smart city and talk about it with others”.\nStandards offer a means to measure and guide progress. The use of assessment methods such as indicators/KPIs or maturity models can give a precise measure against which a city can assess its progress.\nWork of IEC SyC Smart cities\nStandards are already vital to cities used for energy grids, lighting, transport and city services. The IEC has identified over 1800 standards that already impact smart cities.\nThe IEC has taken a systems approach to smart cities with the aim of providing a holistic approach to address complex situations. The SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of various IEC committees as well as other groups such as ISO with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems."

        "content": "The 2019 Qingdao Forum on International Standardization took place on 27-29 October, under the guidance of IEC, ISO, ITU, the Standards Administration of China (SAC) and the People’s Government of Shandong Province. The event was hosted by the Qingdao Municipal Government.\nIEC General Secretary and CEO, Frans Vreeswijk addressed the Forum, highlighting the important contribution that standardization makes to digitalization and the 4th industrial revolution – allowing systems of different manufacturers to interconnect and interoperate without the need for special integration efforts.\n“For Industry 4.0, the IEC has put in place a systems committee on smart manufacturing. While the IEC already provides most of the standards for the plant floor, we closely cooperate with ISO, ITU, IEEE and many fora and consortia to increase efficiency and avoid duplication or overlaps. No single organization can deliver everything that is needed alone without involving the expertise of others”, said Vreeswijk.\nHe also emphasized the fact that mass integration of cyber physical systems with networked sensors and software has blurred the lines between operational technology (OT) and IT, and for this reason both technologies must together protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks.\n“IEC work covers both an OT and IT approach to cyber security. The IEC also operates global Conformity Assessment Systems that verify and certify the security of infrastructure solutions and of information security management”, said Vreeswijk. \nEnsuring best practice is applied through standards, testing and certification\nIEC Treasurer Jo Cops gave a presentation on the standardization and conformity assessment work IEC does for industry 4.0. From electric motors, batteries and energy storage systems to display devices, printed electronics, automation and control and IT, many different IEC technical committees support both IoT and smart manufacturing, contributing their essential know-how and expertise.\n“Some IEC Conformity Assessment Systems offer fully-integrated services that cover the whole system from its design, manufacturing and set-up of devices as well as the installation of the whole system. They oversee inspection, maintenance and repair services and the competence of the personnel executing them, down to system end of life management. There is strong interest for this approach from insurers, investors and regulators who have to manage risk”, said Cops.\nCops also talked about how the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things and the integration of physical machines with networked sensors and software are blurring the lines between IT and OT. Both systems are now based on similar technologies with similar cyber security issues.\n“For IT, third-party certification allows companies to confirm that they have a solid information security management system in place which conforms to ISO/IEC 27001, while in OT cyber resilience in line with IEC 62443 can be certified through the IECEE Industrial Cyber Security Programme,” Cops added.\nOn the agenda\nOther sessions covered the following topics:\n\nStandardization & modern marine industry system\nIntelligent manufacturing international standardization seminar\nSustainable utilization and standardized management of water resources\nInternational standards assist the novel display technologies development\nCultivation of standardization talents and capacity building and the China Standard 2035 Project seminar"

        "content": "A regulators symposium at the IEC General Meeting in Shanghai has highlighted the benefits of maintaining a continuous dialogue between standards developers and regulators. Speakers noted, however, that for an exchange of ideas and concerns to be truly effective, it needed to start in the early stages of the standards development process.\nIEC executive Katharine Fraga opened the symposium on using IEC standardization work to support medical device regulation. She underlined the important contribution made by international standards to safety, consumer confidence and global trade.\nFraga described IEC standards as a valuable tool for public policymakers that contributed to harmonization of policy at the regional and international levels. She added that when IEC standards were the basis of the technical regulation, companies in the regulator’s country could be more competitive at the global level too.\nScott Colburn of the US Food and Drug Administration concurred but warned that work still needed to be done to ensure that all the concerns of regulators were heard. Colburn was representing the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, a voluntary group of regulators from around the world\n“By and large regulators accept the use of standards,” said Colburn. “But this masks differences in degrees of acceptance.”  \nThe remedy, he said, was to “communicate with regulators early and often”. Colburn suggested that early involvement gave regulators the assurance their voice was being heard, while also helping them to develop relevant and effective regulations. In the end, he said, this made it much more likely that they would make direct use of the standard.\nColburn identified transparency as another key issue. In order for regulators to be more engaged, he said, they also needed easier access to information, such as the make-up of the technical committees developing the standards. For instance, it was crucial for regulators dealing with medical devices to know how many clinicians were involved in developing standards. Improving this kind of knowledge would boost acceptance, said Colburn.\nFraga said that standards provided even more value when they were combined with conformity assessment, which covers testing and certification. The IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies that ensure consistent results from anywhere in the world.\nThe Vice Chair of IECEE — the System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components — Steve Margis, described IEC conformity assessment as a toolbox that instilled trust in the marketplace. IECEE schemes test the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of electrical and electronic components, devices and equipment for homes, offices, workshops and health facilities, to ensure they comply with international standards. \nMargis said that IEC conformity assessment provided an additional guarantee to regulators because unlike other testing and certification schemes it was based on the principle of peer assessment.\nIEC Technical Committee 62 Secretary Norbert Bischof explained the development process for standards covering electrical equipment in medical practice, diagnostic imaging equipment and equipment for radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and radiation dosimetry. Bischof stressed that from the point of view of manufacturers, national differences in regulations represented a major cost.\nAlthough one international standard for all was not possible because of specific factors such as climate, he said, the number of differences should be kept to a minimum. “International standards are not only for industry, but regulators can also benefit because they have limited resources,” Bischof said.\nA full report and recommendations will be published on the IEC website."

The ISO/IEC and ITU Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is part of JTC 1 subcommittee 29 which covers coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information.\nMr Teruhiko Suzuki, who chairs ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29, said upon accepting the award: “JPEG is used everywhere, all the time. Every day around the world, a huge number of JPEG images are created, uploaded and shared. It’s a great achievement by the JPEG committee.”\nIntroduced in 1992, JPEG has been universally adopted to preserve high-quality imagery in television production and its tangential yet essential workflows. The Standard ISO/IEC 10918, Information technology – Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images, comprises seven parts.\nThe television industry has benefited greatly from JPEG, which has put users first by providing royalty-free open standards, practical implementation in both hardware and software, and the ability to add in options as required.\nImages and video represent huge amounts of data. The initial motivation for the JPEG standard was to find a way to compress this content in order to make it affordably manageable, storable and transferable, while maintaining the image quality in its reduced size.\nGiven today’s dominant global trend of video and image content usage, the continued work of JPEG remains very important."

        "content": "Two different standards are competing for the attention of regulators. These standards are relevant to what some experts call the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) or, in other words, connected cars which can communicate both with their internal and external environments.\nThe IoV is expected to enable a number of applications essential for self-driving cars such as collision detection, lane change warning, traffic signal control, intelligent traffic scheduling, fleet management, remote diagnostics or infotainment.  By talking to each other, cars can, for example, avoid collision, one of the requirements that must be met for automotive vehicles to become fully autonomous.\nCyber security versus 5G\nThe DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communications) standard enables wireless short-range information exchange between automotive vehicle on board units and roadside units. It is an amendment to Wi-Fi standards, adapted to the unique challenges of automotive applications. Its specifications are in the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and electronics Engineers) standard for wireless access in vehicular environments. DSRC is supported by a number of automotive manufacturers since it enables the implementation of an inbuilt software and hardware add-on that they can manufacture. There is no requirement for any form of cloud or cellular infrastructure. This standard has been extensively tested and is already used in some vehicles. It is backed by the Association of Global Automakers, which includes many car manufacturing heavyweights. The lack of cloud and cellular infrastructure, according to its proponents, makes vehicle to vehicle communication based on DSRC more difficult to hack than the system supported by the rival standard.  It is therefore more cyber secure, in their view.\nThe new kid on the block is the C-V2X standard. V2X technology refers to vehicle to everything communication (including vehicle to infrastructure, to pedestrians, etc…). C-V2X is a cellular-based network technology developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, (3GPP) whose members include different telecoms standardization organizations and associations which develop mobile phone protocols. C-2VX is also backed by the 5G Automotive Association. C-2VX backers argue that this more recent standard is better suited to accommodate new 5G networks and all the improvements they entail. It appears to be favourably viewed in China, where one of the leading telecom operators has conducted trials.\nInternationally agreed standards for the IoT\nThis clash over standards involving the automotive and telecoms industries throws the spotlight on the need for a more global approach. Widely adopted and industry-backed international standards might be one of the ways forward. IEC and ISO have formed a joint technical committee, which is producing international standards for information and technology applications, including the IoT. It also liaises closely with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and IEEE. Several standards have been published, such as ISO/IEC 21823-1, which defines the framework for the interoperability of IoT systems."

        "content": "A new economic model is emerging that re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption. It is based on circular mechanisms in which products and materials can be reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured and recycled. An increasingly popular topic, the notion of a circular economy is gaining traction not only among environmentalists and academics but also within governmental and business sectors.\nAccording to Solange Blaszkowski, Chair of the IEC Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA), the concept of a circular economy is a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived. It affects the entire lifecycle of a product, from initial design and the materials employed to the use of the product, its repair, reuse and the transformation of its parts into a new product.\nTo help IEC standardization experts better understand how to integrate the circular economy and material efficiency into their work, the ACEA organized a workshop in Shanghai on 19 October.\nThe workshop provided an overview of the circular economy and material efficiency, including the regulatory and standardization activities underway around the world. Several manufacturers offered insight on how their industry is introducing the circular economy into their business plans. The workshop concluded with a discussion on how material efficiency affects the standardization activities of the IEC.\nRegulatory landscape\nParticipants learned about the regulatory landscape in Europe, Asia and the America. Measures have been adopted in various parts of the world but countries have focused on different aspects of the circular economy and/or material efficiency.\nAccording to a presentation by Blaszkowski, different parts of the world have different regulatory approaches. And in countries without regulation, market forces are propelling products and services to reduce their environmental impact with, for example, the increased focus on e-waste management and product lifetime extension.\nHowever, a holistic approach is needed. As Blaszkowski noted, “in developing standards it will be important to not only focus on material efficiency but also address issues such as safety, EMC and energy efficiency”.\nIn the IEC, standardization work is underway that addresses aspects of the circular economy. For example, the IEC has issued publications that consider environmental conscious design (IEC 62824) and test after repair of medical equipment (IEC 62353), and dependability of products containing reused parts (IEC 62309).\nPerspective of a home appliance manufacturer\nChristian Dworak from BSH Hausgeräte provided insight on how his company is promoting the circular economy. It has put in place two programmes that offer a new business model based on a shared or leasing service.\nTo promote the shared use of home appliances, the WeWash programme installs and maintains washing machines and dryers that are made available for communal use in residential building laundry rooms. For individual households, the Blue Movement programme offers a subscription service for the monthly rental of different washing machines and dryers. The cost of the subscription varies depending on the model selected and the duration of the subscription. The ownership, maintenance, refurbishment and recycling of the appliances are handled by company.\nAccording to Dworak, the preliminary results demonstrate that the ability to repair machines is key for the long-term success of the programme. “Product design has to allow for efficient repair”. Consumers seek convenience and a full service offering."

Industry leaders, technology experts, regulators, academics and other stakeholders are meeting to discuss future goals and take stock of IEC standardization and conformity assessment work.\n“The IEC is not just a technical organization,” said IEC President James Shannon. “We believe the whole world should be able to benefit from the advancement of technology and we have stayed true to these values ever since the IEC was founded in 1906.”\nMr. Shannon thanked the IEC National Committee of China and Standards Administration of China (SAC) for organizing the 83rd General Meeting in Shanghai in October. He noted that the theme of the 2019 IEC GM was “Better Quality Better Life ― Reliability, Safety, Efficiency”.\n\nThe theme of this year’s meeting is “Better Quality Better Life – Reliability, Safety, Efficiency”. \nSustainability is a major theme of this year’s meeting with an IEC Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) workshop on the circular economy. The ACEA provides guidance to the Standardization Management Board (SMB) on issues related to the environment. The GM is also looking at how IEC work underpins and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe IEC Young Professionals Programme (YPP) is presenting a series of interactive sessions on topics including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), getting products onto the global market faster, the standards development process and the systems approach to standards management. Other highlights include a symposium for regulators on medical device equipment, held in collaboration with the International Medical Device Regulator Forum (IMDRF).\nThe IEC is presenting its Thomas Edison Award to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to IEC work. The awards recognize exceptional achievement, dedicated service and significant contributions to the IEC by officers in IEC technical committees and subcommittees, as well as officers of the conformity assessment systems.\nAn IEC Academy and Capacity Building Day is focusing on best practices for engaging young and emerging leaders, as well as on building capacity for IEC technical expert groups. Presentations provide examples of what is currently being done at the IEC and around the world.\nThis will be the last GM for James Shannon as IEC President. Yinbiao Shu of China will succeed Shannon as president for a three-year term, beginning on 1st January 2020. China, this year’s host, formally joined the IEC in 1957 and became a permanent member in 2011."

        "content": "From mounting piles of waste to the depletion of natural resources, the current modes of production and consumption are unsustainable. Based on the current linear economic model, products are made, used and discarded.\nChallenging this linear model, a new economic model, known as the circular economy (CE), is gaining traction.\nDefining the circular economy\nThe circular economy calls for a paradigm shift across society in which products, components and materials are viewed as regenerative and restorative. It reassesses how resources are managed and how waste is perceived throughout the entire lifecycle of a product from its initial design to its use, repair, reuse, re-manufacture and, finally, its transformation into parts for new products.\nMaterial efficiency (ME) is an essential part of the circular economy. It consists of the conservation of materials by making products more durable, resource-efficient and facilitates the reuse or recycling of parts at the end of the life.\nRole of standards\nStandards can serve as an important tool to promote the circular economy. They can, for example, provide methods to measure the durability or upgradeability of a product. They can assess the ease with which a product can be repaired or recycled. And, they can ensure the quality of the recycled materials.\nStandards must set requirements to guarantee the safety and performance of products, including when, in the future, products will be expected to remain in use for much longer. Issues such as product upgrades and an increased number of repair cycles will need to be addressed. Standards will also need to take into account that products, in the future, will contain increased amounts of recycled material and reused components.\nThe IEC has already issued several publications related to the environmental impact of electric and electronic equipment. For example, IEC 62430 specifies the requirements and procedures to integrate environmental aspects into the design and development of products as well as the materials and components from which they are composed. Two technical reports, IEC TR 62824 and IEC TR 62635, provide guidelines on material efficiency for the ecological design of products and the calculation of recyclability rate for electrical and electronic equipment, respectively.\nHowever, the IEC is faced with the need to undertake further work and provide guidance to its technical committees as they prepare standards. For example, committees may need to understand how to balance between making products that withstand increased number of repair cycles and contain increased number of reused components while still ensure that they perform well and remain safe.\nIEC workshop on the circular economy and material efficiency\nTo help IEC standardization experts better understand how to integrate the circular economy and material efficiency into their work, the Advisory Committee on Environmental aspects (ACEA) is organizing a workshop in Shanghai on 19 October alongside the IEC General Meeting.\nThe workshop will provide an update on the regulatory and standardization activities underway around the world as well as practical examples of their application. Leading manufacturers will provide insight on how their industry is introducing the circular economy into their business plans. The workshop will end with a discussion on how material efficiency affects the standardization activities of the IEC."

The plan in future years is to translate an increasing number of IEC TC 82 Standards into the Chinese language”, says Vice-Chair of IEC TC 82 Zhengxin Liu.\n“It took a lot of work to overcome potential concerns about technical content as well as administrative processes.  I would like to specifically thank IEC TC 82 Vice-Chair Zhengxin Liu, and TC 82 Assistant Secretary Liang Ji as well as joint working group (JWG) 1 Co-Convenor Arne Jacobson for their personal dedication to making this happen. This is a great step forward and sets the precedent to improve the accessibility of IEC standards in the future”, adds IEC TC 82 Secretary George Kelly.\nChina formally joined the IEC in 1957 and became a permanent member in 2011. It is actively contributing to the IEC International Standards governance and Standards systems improvement.\n“The majority of off-grid solar lights which are referred to in IEC TS 62257-9-5 are manufactured in southeast China and are exported throughout the world. Manufacturers and exporters have better access to developing markets if they follow IEC International Standards. In some cases, compliance to these standards is required by national regulations”, Kelly explains.\nWorking with Lighting Global\nIEC TS 62257-9-5 contains test methods that are used for evaluating off-grid solar products for solar modules up to 350 Watts. The methods were originally developed in 2008 through a joint programme involving the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank. Called Lighting Africa, the programme began with pilot activities in Kenya and Ghana. It has since expanded considerably and is now relevant across Africa, Asia, the South Pacific Islands and Latin America. In 2013, the Lighting Asia programme was launched and an umbrella programme was established soon afterwards. Called Lighting Global, it manages the quality standards and assurance activities associated with the programme.\n“In 2013, JWG 1 published the first edition of IEC TS 62257-9-5. The document has since been revised twice with new versions being published in 2016 and 2018. By the end of 2018, almost 40 million products that met the Ligthing Global Quality standards, based on testing to IEC TS 622257-9-5 guidelines, had been sold worldwide, benefitting an estimated 180 million people”, says Arne Jacobson, Co-Convenor of JWG 1 with Leon Drotsche. Arne Jacobson is also Director of the Schatz Energy Research Centre at Humboldt State University in California.\nMeeting sustainable development goals (SDGs)\nThe IEC TS 62257 series is one of the key set of IEC publications helping to meet the United Nations SDG 7, which aims to enable access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030."

        "content": "The United Nations has designated 13 October as the International Day for Disaster Reduction. It celebrates how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters.\nThis year, the International Day for Disaster Reduction will focus on reducing disaster damage to critical infrastructure.\nThe IEC offers the tools necessary to increase infrastructure resilience against disasters as well as for planning and recovery should a disaster strike.\nReady, set resilience\nIEC work helps strengthen disaster resilience of infrastructure through built-in safety mechanisms, processes and minimum requirements. IEC Standards include external environmental conditions in their design requirements. For example, the IEC 61400 series of standards developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 88, addresses external conditions for offshore wind turbine designs which include the ability to withstand 70 m/s (155 mph, nearly 250 km/h) winds (IEC Class I), which is greater than most hurricanes.\nThe IEC ensures safety is an integral aspect of devices and systems, thereby protecting people, critical infrastructure, economies and the environment. These standards can address aspects of safety that apply horizontally to many products or specifically address the needs of a single product type or industry. The IEC 61508 series of standards ensures functional safety throughout the life cycle of electrical and electronic systems and devices.\nHowever, as extreme weather events are likely to occur more frequently, a new type of resiliency for utilities may be necessary. The IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) which identifies key technology trends and market needs, has indicated that it will tackle the issue of resiliency and ensure that electricity distribution systems are more climate-resilient.\nPlanning for disruption\nContinuity planning for potential disasters can help mitigate the adverse effects of disasters. Planning is a key factor to minimize cost and damage should critical infrastructure become inoperable.\nIEC TC 56 prepares standards in the area of dependability, a technical discipline that address the risk assessment and management of services and systems throughout their life cycle, including cyber security threats. It has developed standards that include dependability assessment and technical risk assessment. The IEC White Paper, Microgrids for disaster preparedness and recovery, addresses the actions necessary in anticipation of major electricity outages and after a disaster has occurred.\nRead more about this topic on e-tech."

        "content": "Three scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their pioneering work on lithium-ion batteries. The Nobel Committee said: “Lithium-ion batteries are used globally to power the portable electronics that we use to communicate, work, study, listen to music and search for knowledge.”\nJohn B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino share the USD 900 000 (nine million kronor) prize money for the development of the lightweight, rechargeable, energy efficient and powerful battery. Nowadays it is used in everything from mobile phones to electric cars.\nIEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems are more crucial than ever to establish and test the performance requirements and safety specifications for batteries. Battery technology has hit the headlines recently because of the flammable properties of Lithium-ion.\nDuring 2018, around 23 electric energy storage accidents at utilities in South Korea were reported due to battery-provoked fires. Short circuits, overcharge, over-discharge, mechanical damage and high temperatures can lead to thermal runaway, fire, and explosion in the batteries.\nIEC TC 21 is one of several IEC technical committees preparing standards for cells and batteries. The TC’s work is divided into two distinct areas covering different battery technologies.\nSubcommittee 21A has the task of preparing standards for batteries with alkaline electrolyte, such as NiCad or nickel–metal-hydride, and TC 21 focuses on batteries with acid electrolyte called lead-acid. Both share the work on lithium-ion batteries.\nAccording to a forecast by the International Energy Agency, the number of EVs on the world’s roads will increase from 3 million to 125 million by 2030. In 2018, IEC TC 21 published several important documents, including a second edition of IEC 62660-2 which is part of the IEC 62660 series on secondary Li-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs.\nIEC 62660 has three different parts: the first deals with performance testing, the second with reliability tests and the third with safety requirements. The purpose of IEC 62660-2 is to provide a basic reliability and abuse testing methodology for Li-ion cells which can be used in a diverse range of automobile battery packs and systems.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four CA systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances, etc. of batteries, chargers and charging stations.\nThe expansion of the transport sector, in particular in terms of EVs, e-bikes, mobility scooters and buses, as well as of electrical energy storage needs for the renewable energy sector, smart grid applications and the rapid growth of the portable devices market, points to the continued healthy development of the secondary battery sector. To sustain growth, IEC TC 21 and SC 21A will ensure that equipment manufacturers using secondary batteries have safe and dependable products available, and will continue to prepare new as well as update existing international standards in a burgeoning sector.\n \nRelated long-form content\nBatteries for a sustainable world"

Supporting this data is JPEG, used by 71.6% of all websites, according to Web Technology Surveys.\nThe Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is one of six recipients of the Television Academy’s 71st Engineering Emmy, awarded to an individual, company or organization which significantly improves the transmission, recording or reception of television. The awards will take place on 23 October in Los Angeles, US.\nA star is born\nIntroduced in 1992, JPEG has been universally adopted to preserve high-quality imagery in television production and its tangential yet essential workflows. It is a partnership between the coding of still pictures working group of IEC and ISO committee for coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information (JTC 1/SC 29), which works together with the multimedia study group of ITU.\nIEC and ISO together produce international standards for 22 different information technologies, including SC 29, which has already won three previous Emmy awards.\nThe television industry has benefited greatly from JPEG, which has put users first by providing royalty-free open standards, practical implementation in both hardware and software, and the ability to add in options as required.\nImages and video represent huge amounts of data. The initial motivation for the JPEG standard was to find a way to compress this content in order to make it affordably manageable, storable and transferable, while maintaining the image quality in its reduced size.\nGiven today’s dominant global trend of image and video content usage, the continued work of JPEG remains very important."

        "content": "UNESCO has designated 5 October as a day to celebrate our educators. And while many of us remember using paper and books to learn, increasingly, digital technologies are now available to help teachers educate the next generation of students.\nImagine experiencing an historic moment as it happens, or discovering cellular biology in 3D from inside the body. Innovative technologies, such as virtual reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) can make this possible.\nAI and connectivity already bring many benefits to learning. Algorithms can mine and compare data sets from a variety of learning contexts, in order to find which activities give the best learning outcome. These can include learning management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems and educational games.\nIn an interview with the IEC, Erlend Øverby, who leads IEC and ISO standardization work in the area of IT for learning, education and training (ITLET), explains how standards can contribute to education.\nHow is technology affecting the education industry as a whole?\n“There needs to be a shift in attitude towards seeing the computer as a tool for solving problems, and not only as a computing machine. This is what needs to be taught in schools, so that if there’s something we don’t understand or if we need more insights, we should know how to find the answers using technology.\nTechnology in itself does not provide learning, education or training. When things are put in context and managed by a ‘teacher’, then we have education. The use of technology must be put in a context that fulfils the goals of learning, education and training. Technology is nothing alone; it is how we choose to implement it that matters.”\nWhat are the challenges?\n“Our main challenge is to get more countries, developed and developing, as well as experts, to participate in our work. All countries with a digital education strategy should take an active role and give their perspectives. Equally, EdTech companies and startups, who plan to have a global presence, should see how their solutions could be easily adopted if IT-specific details are interoperable with other IT systems, for example, to better share data.\nRegulators need standards that will contain requirements to put forward to providers of IT programmes for schools, which must ensure the technology is independent of devices and ecosystems and is fully interoperable. This will avoid locking schools into a specific system and allow teachers to choose the best learning experience for its students.”\nIEC and ISO international standards for learning, education and training, will help advance the digitization of education, by ensuring soft- and hardware developers provide interoperability and data security, thereby broadening accessibility and enhancing the overall quality of global education."

        "content": "As environmental concerns sky-rocket, new ways of designing products so as to minimize waste and facilitate recycling are adopted by a growing number of manufacturers.\nRegulators have started making requirements for environmentally conscious design throughout the life cycle of products, including raw material acquisition, manufacture, distribution, use, maintenance, re-use and end-of-life. A new model, called the circular economy, which puts the emphasis on the recycling and reusing of materials and products, is championed by environmentalists and considered, and often implemented, by a growing number of industry players.\nInternational standards are required to ensure these players follow the same guidelines when it comes to managing the environemental life cycle of products. These internationally agreed specifications can either follow or be adopted in local regulations.\nIEC has released a number of standards relating to the circular economy. Among these, IEC 62430 is destined to be used by all those involved in the design and development of electrical and electronic products. The publication concerns all parties in the supply chain regardless of organization type, size, location and complexity. The standard establishes the steps to follow for companies wishing to implement environmentally conscious design for their products.\nIEC is soon to release a new edition of the standard, in collaboration with ISO. “The scope of this new edition is wider and does not only refer to electrotechnical products and systems. It can be applied industry-wide. We have worked hand in hand with ISO TC 207 and it will be a joint publication,” says Christophe Garnier, Chair of the IEC technical committee that publishes the 62430 standards.\nTo find out more about the IEC and the circular economy, read https://basecamp.iec.ch/download/brochure-e-tech-articles-preparing-the…."

They expect that figure to more than double by 2050 and to more than triple by 2100.\nTo deal with Active Assisted Living (AAL) issues, the IEC has established a Systems Committee, IEC SyC AAL. This SyC has the role of promoting safety, security, privacy and cross-vendor interoperability in the use of AAL systems and services, and of fostering standardization which boosts their usability and accessibility. Its role and scope are constantly being expanded.\nStandardization work is essential for helping the elderly and people with disabilities to live independently for as long as possible. International standards ensure the safety, reliability and compatibility of diverse technologies.\nThese include the Internet of Things (IoT), which offers innovative ways to help aging populations. IoT devices, buildings, cars and other objects are embedded with electronics, software, sensors and network technology, allowing them to collect and exchange data with a view to assisting elderly and disabled people with everyday activities.\nIn the home, if a person with dementia forgets to close a window at night during winter, or leaves the stove on, or if an elderly person living alone falls over and is unable to move, the consequences could be fatal. Sensors in smart appliances or placed on doors and windows offer solutions for detecting temperature, motion and location.\nSmart home care systems can switch on lights when they detect a person’s movement, remind people to take medicine, turn off appliances after a certain time has passed and monitor daily activities. If there is a change in routine, care givers or family are alerted. Some systems also link directly to various emergency services.\nGPS tracking devices are particularly useful for people with different conditions affecting the memory. Family or health carers can track a person and help them find their way back home.\nAge-related health issues, including increased susceptibility to chronic conditions such as diabetes, dementia and cardiovascular disease, will increase the number of patients and put a strain on health systems and service providers. Technology is helping to address this.\nThe way we detect, monitor and treat an increasing number of diseases is changing thanks to wearable and portable medical devices. For example, patients can check their own heart rate or blood pressure and send the results to online healthcare systems in hospitals and clinics.\nAs greater numbers of people need care and fewer care givers enter the workplace, robots will have a role to play in smart home systems. Cutting-edge sensory technology already enables robots in manufacturing to recognize and adjust to subtle changes, robots can perform daily tasks and help out in emergencies."

        "content": "Today, the workshop on LVDC hosted by the IEC and the BSN opens in Jakarta. The workshop provides participants with insight on LVDC, the work of the IEC in developing standards for LVDC and case studies on the introduction of LVDC in Africa and India.\nOver 35 participants are attending, including experts from across Europe and Asia.\n“We are very excited to be in Jakarta and have the opportunity to talk about LVDC. Indonesia, with 10,000 inhabited islands, has a daunting task of bringing affordable clean energy to all these remote sites. Here, IEC standards for LVDC based networks and solar home systems are pivotal to Indonesia achieving its electrification objectives and also its SDG commitments”, said Vimal Mahendru, Chair of the IEC systems committee on LVDC.\nInterest in LVDC\nRenewed interest in LVDC has been sparked by the technology’s suitability in providing electricity in rural areas that are currently not served by the electrical grid. LVDC can be generated anywhere using renewable energy. And because solar, wind and water energy all yield DC electricity, it is more efficient to use the DC electricity directly for DC driven devices rather than converting it to AC and back to DC again. Electricity generated from off-grid, renewable energy can be used for applications such as water pumping and healthcare services.\nAccording to Mahendru, “today, in most countries, electricity is produced in large plants as alternating current (AC). But for a majority of devices, we consume electricity as direct current (DC). Renewable energy sources typically yield direct current. This means that, especially for rural areas, small-scale installations can provide safe, affordable and clean electricity for all”.\nIn India, 48 LVDC based projects have brought electricity access in areas with diverse geographies. These are either DC microgrids or solar home systems, all operating on 48V LVDC. Electricity has been used for pumping water as well as in homes and schools. It is estimated that LVDC based electricity has been deployed in 600,000 dwellings.\nA systems approach\nGiven that the standardization of LVDC technologies requires a holistic approach, the IEC has set up a dedicated systems committee (SyC).  SyC LVDC provides guidance on the standardization of LVDC and includes the input from various IEC technical committees such as those related to solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems (TC 82), the safety of electrical installations (TC 64), system aspects of electrical energy supply (TC 8) and electric accessories (TC 23).\nSyC LVDC is currently preparing a reference document with evaluation methods for determining whether two electrical items or systems, when connected together, will operate reliably as intended and meet safety requirements. It is also considering work on the compilation of use-cases for public LVDC distribution.\nSyC LVDC held meetings in Jakarta earlier in the week."

His home was able to weather the worst of the big bad wolf’s huffing and puffing, unlike those of his less well-prepared siblings.\nThat is how, as children, we learn that minimizing risk means designing products to be secure from the foundation. Not surprisingly, the concept of security-by-design is popular in both software and hardware development.\nIt means making products and systems that are not only free of vulnerabilities but also subject to continuous testing during their life cycle. The thinking is that when trouble strikes, it is already too late. \n“Most of the time cyber security is after the fact,” says IEC cyber security expert Moreno Carullo. “It’s like adding air conditioning after a building has gone up. There are are constraints.”\nCarullo is a key member of IEC Technical Committee 57, Working Group 15, which brings together ICS operators, SCADA engineers, security specialists and networking engineers to develop a key cybersecurity standard on behalf of the IEC. \n“If you think at the very beginning, like we’re doing in Working Group 15, of all the possible pieces and all the elements that an end-to-end security system should have. The net result is that it’s more secure because you’re designing it, not reverse engineering or discovering something.”\nSecurity-by-design can enhance the protection of new power stations and reduce the need for costly upgrades and enhancements during their operating life. It is, of course, also true that security-by-design cannot fully protect a plant from rapidly evolving cyber attacks, which may expose previously unknown vulnerabilities.\nThat is why TC 57 WG 15 have designed the security-by-design standard IEC 62351 to incorporate tools for pervasive and continuous monitoring.\nRelated content in e-tech\nCyber security-by-design"

The different schemes test the safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of electrical and electronic components, devices and equipment for homes, offices, workshops and health facilities, to ensure they comply with international standards such as those published by IEC.\n“Peer Assessment is one of the core principles of IEC and all IEC Conformity Assessment Systems. It facilitates mutual trust among the participants, which leads to mutual recognition of test results and CB Test Certificates within the community”, said Wolfram Zeitz, Deputy Secretary of IECEE.\nPeer assessment training allows new peer assessors to become qualified and existing peer assessors to maintain their qualifications, without which, they cannot operate within IECEE. This is achieved with an exam at the end of the training.\nAttending the training are 122 lead or technical assessors from IECEE registered national certification bodies (NCBs) and their testing laboratories (CBTLs), mainly from Europe, but also some from Asia and the Americas.\nOn the agenda\nThe three-day peer assessor training focuses on the harmonization of assessment criteria to ensure that all IECEE NCBs, their CBTLs and customer testing facilities (CTFs) apply IECEE rules and procedures consistently and fully comply with them.\nAdditionally, the programme also ensures that the latest modifications of rules and procedures decided recently by the IECEE management committee are brought to the attention of the peer assessors and are implemented in the assessments.\nThe training covers many aspects including (not exhaustive):\n\nPrinciples and purpose of IECEE peer assessment\nHow to organize an assessment\nChecklists\nAssessor code of conduct\nRelevant tools and documents\nAssessments teams\nWitnessing of tests\n\nMany more topics are being discussed, and experiences shared for testing and certification in the areas of electric vehicles, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), batteries, solar PV and more.\nFind out more about the IECEE peer assessment programme."

For example, colour changes shown behind the runners in their lanes indicate the speed at which they are running and show where their fastest speed occurred in the race. 3DAT will be hosted by Intel in data centres on cloud infrastructure.\nThe most connected Games\nAudiences love to watch their favourite teams and sports men and women as they win games, smash world records and push the human limits. Today audiences are far more tech savvy than ever before and will be able to see some of the different sports from entirely new angles.\n5G (5th generation cellular network) platforms will enhance the connectivity of 42 venues, including the Olympics Stadium, the athletes’ village, operations headquarters and broadcasting set-ups.\nInnovative live virtual reality (VR) broadcast will allow fans to immerse into a number of sports and venues, such as the opening and closing ceremonies, track & field, gymnastics, boxing and beach volleyball and see the action from entirely new perspectives.\nVR training which gives an immersive experience and feedback along the way, is also being used by the organizing committee to ensure key managers at competition venues are ready. Digital twinning will enable the organizers to make the most of the data for training, planning and more.\nHi-tech security\nThe Games will be spread across different venues. In order to ensure security and speed up the entry process, a facial recognition system will identify over 300,000 people at the games. This biometric authentication system uses state-of-the-art AI technologies, which can link photo data with an integrated circuit (IC) card to be carried by all accredited athletes, volunteers, media, and other staff.\nBehind the tech\nIt’s all done with standards.\nIEC develops international standards which test all the devices within 5G networks to ensure their safety and functioning.\nIEC also develops standards for information technologies together with ISO. For virtual reality, these cover computer graphics and virtual reality, image processing, environmental data representation, support for mixed and augmented reality, interaction with, and visual presentation of information.  \nIt also develops standards for access systems using radio frequency identification (RFID), biometrics, as well as cards and personal identification."

        "content": "In April, ANCE appointed Juan Rosales its new President, the youngest in the association’s history. With this appointment, ANCE, the leading association for standardization and conformity assessment in Mexico, is integrating a new generation of leaders in management positions.\nRosales is actively involved in standardization and conformity assessment work at national, regional and international levels. In addition to his Presidency at ANCE, he is also the Vice President of Council for Harmonization of Electrotechnical Standards of the Nations in the Americas (CANENA) and the head of the Mexican delegation to IEC Technical Committee 61 which covers safety of household and similar electrical appliances.\nRosales credits the IEC Young Professionals Programme (YPP), in which he participated in 2010, and his selection as a YP Leader, as key factors in helping to shape his career success.\nHow did the YP Programme boost your involvement in standardization and conformity assessment work at the national and/or international levels?\nBeing part of the IEC Young Professional Programme 2010 in Seattle has been one of most remarkable experiences in my professional life. Going back nine years, I was part of a testing lab for laundry equipment. However, after being selected as one of the three YP Leaders, new opportunities arose.\nI received an invitation from the IEC National Committee of Mexico to share my experience and ideas for a programme in Mexico which, after several years, has become a strong platform for involving new generations. I also had the opportunity to present my perspective of the YP Programme in regional forums such as CANENA and the Pan American Standards Commission (COPANT) as well as at many IEC events.\nThese opportunities provided me with a platform on which to build a career as an expert in standardization and conformity assessment, not only at the local level but also at the international level. Being selected to be a part of the IEC family has provided me with a strong sense of confidence throughout these years.\nWhy would you encourage potential YPs to participate in the programme?\nThe standards and conformity assessment landscape needs people with fresh ideas and with a new perspective. The way we do business has changed dramatically in the last five years compared with what we were doing in the last decades. In my opinion, we need to make room for a new generation, for individuals who are committed to building a career in standardization.\nThe YP Programme provides a perfect starting point for this new generation – the fundamental basis – to build a career. And, of course, it is the opportunity to interact with people from many different cultures.\nWhat do you think are some of the big challenges currently facing standards development organizations (SDOs)?\nSDOs need to keep pace with technology changes, to improve the efficiency and quality of their regulatory instruments and ensure that the benefits derived from standardization and technical regulations match consumer needs in a timely manner.\nIn a globalized world, it’s also important that SDOs increase their development of international standards but also respect the particularities of national conditions.\nLooking ahead, what are some of the key trends in technology impacting your industry?\nInternet of things (IoT) is a trend revolutionizing many aspects of our daily life and consumer products. Household appliances are not exempted. Our industry, like many others, will be impacted by smart manufacturing and it’s important that IEC remains as a standards solutions facilitator in order to smooth the implementation of this trend.\nThe full interview is available on e-tech."

        "content": "IBC (International Broadcasting Convention) kicks off today in the Dutch capital. Key technologies to look out for are summed up by a few acronyms which might seem a little cryptic to the non-initiated: 5G, 8K, HDR and IP. Let’s try and shed some light on what they all mean.\nFaster\n5G: the fifth-generation cellular network is expected to process volumes of data 100 times greater than is possible with 4G. The connection speed of this latest generation mobile communication system also delivers signals more reliably than previous networks. This is very useful for high-quality VR applications, for instance. For the time being, however, it is more talked about than actually used, as telecom companies are only just beginning to launch 5G services.\nBigger\n8K is 16 times the resolution of standard High Definition (HD) which most of us now have on our TV sets. High production value drama and films have already been produced in 8K, but there is still a long way to go before any of us adopt it in our homes. One of the main drivers will be the next Olympic Games in Tokyo as the host broadcaster NHK will be filming and producing in 8K. It remains to be seen whether consumers will be tempted to adopt it and, if so, when. Having said that, quite a few manufacturers have already launched 8K TV sets and a lot of kit at IBC will be 8K-related.\nBetter\nHDR: stands for high dynamic range. It has been a staple IBC story for the last four years. It is one of the important features of 4K TV, which is only beginning to be deployed in our homes. TV contrast is the difference between how dark and bright the broadcast image can get. HDR is meant to greatly and visibly improve colour contrast.\nFaster, bigger and better!\nIP: stands for Internet Protocol. The network technology is expected to eventually replace SDI or serial digital interface in broadcast and post-production facilities, as it provides much higher bandwidth. However, some of the performance characteristics of SDI – such as clean, deterministic switching, timing and synchronisation as well as signal latency – are challenging to replicate in IP-based networks. Many manufacturers have acknowledged and embraced this reality, developing products that enable mixed SDI/IP environments. Many live IP demos should nevertheless take place during the Amsterdam tech-fest.\nStandards are key\nIEC International Standards are paving the way for these new technologies to be rolled out. To mention but a few: ISO/IEC TR 23008-14 provides guidance on the processing of high dynamic range and wide colour gamut video content. ISO/IEC 23008-2 forges the path to Ultra High Definition 4K and 8K TV. IEC 62232 takes into account the mmWave frequencies used for 5G networks."

        "content": "A digital twin is the digital replica of a physical asset. It can be used to help manufacturers test the stresses and tolerances of their products.\nIt can monitor the physical integrity of major infrastructure, like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, or help plan the production process and programme machines.\nWhen constructing a building, architects and engineers rely on Building Information Modelling (BIM), an intelligent 3D model-based process that uses data to provide the insight necessary to efficiently plan, construct and manage infrastructure. But what if BIM could be expanded to include an entire city? This is the objective of City Information Modelling (CIM).\nCity Information Modelling is the development of digital representations of a city comprised of large quantities of data – including real-time data – which enable better city planning and management. It is a giant system with various types of city information, from the natural environment to infrastructure to human activity. It is a management tool that can be used by government, industry and residents to help them better understand their city and how it can be improved.\nBenefits of CIM\nCIM can help with city planning and city management. City planners can better understand the potential positive and negative results of a given option, see what the city will look like and identify what happens if something is changed. City manager can observe what is happening at a given moment in the city and what needs to be fixed.\nCIMs provide many benefits for smart cities. For example, by providing the rapid acquisition and analysis of city data, CIMs can help city managers make decisions, improve citizen participation in urban management and help industry improve its service offerings.\nAs a result, city infrastructure can be better monitored and managed. Safety can be improved with real-time traffic information. Driverless vehicles can be deployed using the holographic environment containing data on traffic conditions and infrastructure provided by the CIM. Electricity grids can be managed more efficiently with accurate information on electricity load and remote control. Should a disaster strike, emergency staff can collect information and respond effectively.\nHowever, to obtain the full benefits of the CIM, it must be compatible with every other aspect of the city so that city management can be fully integrated.\nGathering and analyzing the data\nCIMs rely upon huge volumes of data as well as the effective management and analysis of the data.\nData is provided using a combination of BIM and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Real-time data can be obtained through extensive use of IoT sensors placed throughout the city. This large volume of data is then brought together using cloud computing for storage and access. Artificial intelligence offers the analysis of the data and can generate different scenarios to help manage the city better.\nThese insights gained through the CIM can be used to continually improve the operation of the city for the well-being of its residents.\nIEC work\nThe IEC has set up a systems committee, SyC Smart city, with the aim of fostering the development of smart city standards in the area of electrotechnology. It promotes the collaboration between the different IEC technical committees as well as other standards development organization and offers a systems analysis to standard development.\nSyC Smart city is in the process of collecting and analyzing use cases with the intention of developing the requirements for potential CIM standardization work."

        "content": "Robots and drones can safely reach places humans can’t. They have been used to free people trapped under rubble after earthquakes and access dangerous areas, such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster, as part of emergency response actions.\nLast year was the most destructive wildfire season to date in California, where more than 8000 fires destroyed in excess of 700 000 hectares of land, killing at least 80 people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in rescue operations and insurance claims.\nThe robots that operate in such hazardous environments are “explosion-proof”. They are sealed units, many have their arm pressurized with air to prevent the ingress of explosive solvents and their motor designed with Ex protection covered by International Standards prepared by IEC Technical Committee 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres.\nNew firefighting methods will save lives and the environment\nA new digital system known as the low power wireless ground sensor nodes (LPWGSN) used in conjunction with drones has been created to detect fires in the early stages and monitor developments in real time, revolutionizing firefighting techniques and save lives.\nDeveloped by the University of Westminster and the VLSI Research Group, which is a partner of the Advanced Forest Fire Fighting (AF3) project, the solar powered sensors are placed on the ground in areas prone to fires and can monitor aspects including carbon dioxide and monoxide levels, temperature and humidity and location thanks to GPS technology. If one sensor detects a fire it communicates with other sensors, measuring distances from the fire.\nThis data is sent through the network, to a drone which flies off to get a visual of the particular area. This information is then sent to firefighting teams, who can quickly respond to very precise areas to put out fires.\nIf small self-flying planes were used to drop water or foam on fires, it would mean that fires could be fought 24/7 no matter how thick the smoke was or the time of day. They would be guided by the sensor data and GPS coordinates, so visibility would not be an issue.\nHands-free thermal imaging\nHand held thermal cameras are normal kit for many firefighters, but a helmet with thermal imaging developed in Switzerland, allows firefighters to work hands free. Thermal imaging enables quickly locating the fire source, which may be behind them and lets them see if objects are too hot to touch, such as door handles.\nFire investigators train with VR and AR\nFirst responders can use VR and AR programmes to train for real life emergencies. There are many benefits, such as, the ability to choose different roles (paramedic at the scene, firefighter, commander in the tower centre, etc.) but it is also being used by forensic specialists for training.\nA UK company has developed a VR software programme which offers a very realistic training for fire and rescue services. It has achieved this by using laser scanning and 360 degree HD photography to capture images from real fire scenes.\nThe programme enables users to walk around a room and inspect the area outside, as well as pick up objects, look for evidence and assess casualties. Meanwhile, the trainer can observe remotely from different perspectives including from a bird’s eye view and offer real-time advice.\nThe environment is safe and given that it would normally cost GBP 8 000 to run the same real life training, it will save greatly on costs as users can practice as many times as required."

        "content": "Batteries have become indispensable devices in our everyday lives: so many items we use on a daily basis rely on battery power to function. Ensuring that they are safe to use throughout their life cycle is more important than ever.\nBattery technology has hit the headlines recently because of the flammable properties of Lithium-ion (Li-ion). During 2018, around 23 electric energy storage accidents at utilities in South Korea were reported due to battery-provoked fires. Short circuits, overcharge, over-discharge, mechanical damage and high temperatures can lead to thermal runaway, fire, and explosion in the batteries.\nIEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems are therefore more crucial than ever to establish and test the safety specifications and performance requirements for batteries, whether lead-acid, nickel-cadmium (NICad) or, indeed, Li-ion. IEC TC 21 is one of several IEC technical committees preparing standards for cells and batteries.\nThe work of IEC TC 21 is divided into two distinct areas covering different battery technologies. Subcommittee 21A has the task of preparing standards for batteries with alkaline electrolyte, such as NiCad or nickel–metal-hydride, and TC 21 focuses on batteries with acid electrolyte called lead-acid. Both share the work on Li-ion batteries.\nIECEE (IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components) is one of the four CA systems administered by the IEC. It runs a scheme which tests the safety, performance component interoperability, energy efficiency, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), hazardous substances, etc. of batteries, chargers and charging stations.\nEV growth and batteries\nAccording to a forecast by the International Energy Agency, the number of EVs on the world’s roads will increase from 3 million to 125 million by 2030. In 2018, IEC TC 21 published several important documents, including a second edition of IEC 62660-2 which is part of the IEC 62660 series on secondary Li-ion cells for the propulsion of EVs.\nIEC 62660 has three different parts: the first deals with performance testing, the second with reliability tests and the third with safety requirements. The purpose of IEC 62660-2 is to provide a basic reliability and abuse testing methodology for Li-ion cells which can be used in a diverse range of automobile battery packs and systems.\nLead acid can easily be recycled\nIEC TC 21 also publishes a wide number of lead acid battery specifications. While this technology is still predominant because it is cheaper and safer than Li-ion for now, lead acid batteries are being phased out in a number of applications. “Lead has a bad reputation. Just see the coverage around the fire at Notre Dame de Paris and the lead oxide dust levels it generated,” says TC 21 Chair Herbert Giess .\n“But what people often don’t know is that lead-acid batteries are 98% recyclable. They are recycled both in the US and Europe, using well mastered processes.”\n \nRead more\nBatteries for a sustainable world"

At the request of industry, IECQ is providing a worldwide certification system for one of the world’s best known and most trusted information security standards.\nAlthough ISO/IEC 27001 certification has been around for some time, the lack of harmonization has resulted in different interpretations of the standard, with many certification bodies offering their own individual certificates. IECQ was regarded the organization best placed to offer a consistent approach.\nISO/IEC 27001 specifies the requirements for implementing, maintaining and continually improving an ISMS. It includes requirements for the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to the needs of the organization.\nThe requirements set out in ISO/IEC 27001 are generic and intended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or nature. The standard makes recommendations regarding leadership, commitment and policies, as well as actions to address risks and opportunities.\nIt’s a common misconception that ISO/IEC 27001 deals only with cyber security. In actual fact, ISO/IEC 27001 goes way further than cyber security and covers the global management of information.\nThis includes both information on an organization’s own operations, as well as information from external sources, such as suppliers and customers. A management system that meets ISO/IEC 27001 will look at overall security features such as:\n\n– are there locks on the front doors?\n– who can have keys and how is the allocation of keys/passwords to enter the building managed?\n– under what conditions can external organizations have access into the building, e.g. cleaners, service organizations, essential services, etc.?\n– is there a policy to lock up files overnight to prevent security staff and cleaners from seeing sensitive information on desks?\n– how are old records – both paper and electronic – disposed of?\n– what happens with the hard drives of computers that are discarded and replaced by newer ones?\nISO/IEC 27001 is now part of the approved process scheme that provides for the independent assessment and issuing of an international IECQ certificate of conformity for organizations that have demonstrated compliance with the relevant standards and/or specifications. IECQ ISMS facility assessments under the IECQ AP scheme ensure a focus on the key technical and administrative elements that provide confidence that the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 have been met.\nIECQ is a worldwide approval and certification system that covers the supply, assembly, associated materials and processes of a large variety of electronic components used in millions of devices and systems. IECQ provides manufacturers with independent verification that the requirements in IEC International Standards and other specifications are met by suppliers who hold an IECQ certification."

It also has a fast battery charging time of 40 minutes.\nIEC work for the aviation sector\nWhile aviation safety standards have to be met, all the electronic parts working together to make the aircraft depart and land safely will do so according to the international safety standards developed by the IEC.\nThe organization has even set up a couple of Technical Committees which produce standards specifically for the aviation sector. IEC TC 107 develops process management standards on equipment and systems used in the field of avionics. The IEC 62668 series of standards establishes the guidelines for avoidance, detection and mitigation of counterfeit parts, for instance.\nIEC TC 97 prepares interantional standards relevant to the the electrical installations for the lighting and beaconing of aerodromes. The IEC 61820 series specifies the system design and installation requirements for constant current circuits for aeronautical ground lighting.\nConformity assessment\nOne of the four conformity assessment systems run by the IEC, IECQ, has developed a scheme for the aviation industry. The IECQ avionics parts and assembly management system is designed to evaluate that the processes of avionics equipment manufacturers are compliant with IEC 62239-1 which defines the requirements for developing an electronic component management plan.\nIECQ also provides the counterfeit avoidance programme which helps manufacturers and subcontracters avoid counterfeit parts when selecting and using components."

Protecting supply chains is therefore an absolute priority for all organizations.\nCyber attacks on businesses and industry may have disastrous consequences for the companies affected. Ultimately, they may even force some businesses or industries to close.\nHowever, the most serious cyber threats at national level concern critical infrastructure, which covers assets and systems that are essential to the functioning of a country’s society and economy. Damage to power utilities, transport, health, and telecommunications systems, for example, could have wide and disruptive implications for societies.\nThe IT supply chain consists of a set of organizations with linked sets of resources and processes, each of which acts as an acquirer, supplier, or both to form successive supplier relationships established upon placement of a purchase order, agreement, or other formal sourcing agreement.\nA definition of supply chain for industrial and other physical assets, such as power grids, transportation systems, smart manufacturing, etc. is more complex as it comprises not only IT, but also the operational technology (OT) supply chain. This includes personnel (developers, suppliers, vendors and staff working on OT) and processes, as well as products—components and systems central to OT, such as industrial automation and control systems (IACS) and increasingly, internet of things (IoT) elements.\nThe IEC’s very extensive work on cyber security includes Standards, Technical Requirements and Specifications and, increasingly, conformity assessment (CA) and certification.\nIn addition to the ISO/IEC 27000 family of Standards for IT service management, and to the IEC 62443 series of horizontal publications for industrial communication networks and IACS, relevant to many domains, a number of IEC Technical Committees (TCs) and Subcommittees (SCs) have developed specific Standards, Technical Specifications and Requirements for certain sectors.\nThe IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) has set up an Advisory Committee on Security (ACSEC).

Their ease of use will also be increased if docking stations are standardized as well as recharging processes. Last but not least, standardizing recycling procedures will benefit the environment.\nXiaodong Wu is the vice-president of the Shanghai Electrical Apparatus Research Institute and has more than 25 years of experience in research and engineering in the field of information engineering and automation.  He has been involved in the IEC since 2011 as a member of different working groups on smart grid user interfaces. Since November 2018 he has been a member of the IEC Systems Committee (SyC) on smart manufacturing.\nHe has published many scientific papers, the latest being “Management efficiency analysis of the power grid with the load characteristics of electric vehicle exchange power”.\nHe has received a wide number of awards, the latest being The golden prize of Shanghai excellent invention, awarded in 2018. cbi"

        "content": "A recently released movie tells the story of how Nikola Tesla’s patent for alternating current (AC) eventually prevailed over Thomas Edison’s direct current (DC) technology. What it does not mention is that DC is not only making a comeback, but also offering new hope to the more than one billion people with no access to electricity.\nThomas Edison dismissed Tesla’s AC system as “impractical”, compared to his simpler, though less efficient, DC system. The problem was that Edison’s solution only allowed for an electrical grid within a one-mile radius from the power source. This made it impractical for transmitting the massive quantities of energy needed by factories and cities.\nTesla’s system was both cheaper and able to transmit power over long distances. In the end the entrepreneur George Westinghouse backed AC because he saw it as the only means to connecting the whole country.\nThe Current War neatly illustrates how an increasingly desperate Edison launched a campaign of dirty tricks to discredit AC. A scene in the movie, based on a real event, shows Edison electrocuting a horse in a misguided bid to prove that AC is more dangerous than DC. “If Mr. Edison succeeds, he will set us back so far we may never recover,” retorts Tesla elsewhere in another scene.  \nThat is not very fair either. The truth is that most of the devices that we use in our AC-powered homes and offices today — for instance TVs, refrigerators and LED lighting — run on DC power. It is not a sustainable model. Every time we convert DC to AC, the adaptors and transformers we use lose up to 20% electricity as heat energy. Ever wonder why your phone charger gets so hot?\nIt is why DC is making a comeback in both developed and developing countries via Low Voltage Direct Current. LVDC provides a distributed solution to transmitting electricity, in contrast to the top-down structure of AC that we know today. Traditionally, large utility plants generate electricity and then transport it through a network of high voltage, overhead lines to substations.\nWhen the electricity reaches the substations it is converted to lower voltages for distribution to individual households. With LVDC, production takes place much closer to where the electricity is consumed.\nLVDC removes the need to convert from DC to AC and then back again to DC, as the traditional, top-down AC structure requires. This makes DC less wasteful and more cost-effective.\nIn developed economies, the use of LVDC will help improve energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint while ensuring excellent power quality. In developing countries it will allow the direct use of power generated by solar panels, for example, which yield DC current.\nThe IEC is leading standardization efforts. IEC International Standards for LVDC provide the technical foundation for manufacturers to build safe DC products and guide installers of LVDC systems anywhere in the world. They allow regulators to bench-mark and compare systems from different vendors.\nInternational standards will facilitate the broad roll-out and application of LVDC technologies and underpin local manufacturing of appliances. They will help accelerate commercialization and open up markets to fair competition which benefits the end consumer."

        "content": "More than 100 IEC Standards can now be processed by computers. An indispensable step as the interactions between human beings and machines intensify.\nTalking to machines\nThere are many definitions of language. Robert Henry Robin, professor of general linguistics at the University of London and one of the recognized experts in that field, defines it as “a system of conventional spoken, manual, or written symbols by means of which human beings, as members of a social group and participants in its culture, express themselves.”\nIn our increasingly digitalized world, new aspects of language are however required to communicate with a totally different type of interlocutor which is not a human being. Machines, or computers, depending on how you want to call them, have their own language which is getting increasingly complex as artificial intelligence technology moves forward.\nIncreased automatization\nHuman machine interfaces (HMIs) are one of the means by which humans communicate with computers in a growingly automatized environment. According to the IEC glossary, an HMI is “a display screen, either as part of an intelligent electronic device (IED) or as a stand-alone device, presenting relevant data in a logical format, with which the user interacts. An HMI typically presents windows, icons, menus and pointers, and may also include a keypad to enable user access and interaction.”\nIEC is working on standards for communication with HMIs at the electric grid level, among other things. Power grids are modernizing which allows them to operate in a more efficient and effective manner; HMIs are typically “the face” of this process. The HMI application plays a key role in the visualization and control of substation automation systems or the monitoring of the real time status of a solar or wind farm, for example.\nIEC Technical Committee 57 issues the IEC 61850 series of publications, which includes some of the core international standards used for integrating digital communication processes into the existing grid. A new standard in the works is IEC 61850-6-2 which aims to specify a description language for extensions for human interfaces.\nStandards which can be computer processed\nOn a broader level, an increasing number of IEC Standards are machine readable, meaning that they have to be available in a format that is easily processed by a computer. IEC TC 65 prepares international standards for systems used in industrial process control and automation.\nIt has notably released IEC 61131-10, part of the IEC 61131 series of standards which describes programmable logic controllers. Users of these standards want standardized programming languages and the ability to exchange a complete program or parts of that program between different development environments, for instance from an exporting environment to an importing environment.\nIEC 61131-10 specifies an XML-based exchange format for the export and import of the IEC 61131 standards which deals with these programming languages. The standard includes code components that are intended to be directly processed by a computer.\nMany other standards issued by IEC TC 65, but also IEC TC 57, can be computer processed. It won’t come as a surprise that many of the standards in the IEC 61850 series are also machine readable."

It takes into account not only national laws and regulations, but also the environment in which organizations operate.\nThe new standard is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, which many organizations have already used to implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS). While ISO/IEC 27001 requires organizations to take their environment into consideration, the new standard goes a step further by mapping to the privacy framework and principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100."

These RE sources mainly use low voltage direct current (LVDC).\nMany aspects will need to be considered and adapted, such as street lighting systems, domestic lighting and electronic products, which will eventually become safer and more economic to run. Against this backdrop, IEC and the Electric Lamp and Component Manufacturer’s Association of India (ELCOMA) will hold a joint LVDC conference on 9 August in New Delhi.\nParticipants will hear real use cases impacting lighting industry and learn from experts about what is driving the development of LVDC, the key role it will play in providing universal access, as well as how to roll out LVDC technology safely and broadly. It will also be an opportunity to learn about lighting industry’s emerging opportunities.\nThis is an important conference to attend, because it will help everyone involved in the power supply chain, from manufacturers of future components, to maintenance and training services, to get useful insights and prepare for the transformation from high voltage to LVDC”, said Vimal Mahendru, Chair, IEC Systems Committee on LVDC and member of the IEC Standardization Management Board, who will present an introduction to LVDC during the event.\nOther members of the IEC SyC LVDC will be present during the different event sessions. Cristiano Masini from IEC Technical Committee 23 for electrical accessories will discuss the impact of LVDC on buildings and emerging opportunities, while Harry Stockman Chair of the Systems Committee Work Group (WG) for use cases for public LVDC distribution will talk about LVDC in mature grids.  Mr Rajeev Sharma, Convener of SyC LVDC WG1 and head of Electrotechncial standardization, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), will also present the updated status of IEC standardization of LVDC for electricity access.\nFind out more about the IEC-ELCOMA LVDC Conference."

        "content": "Sweltering temperatures have hit the globe during the last couple of months. In India, some areas reached 50.8° C. In the Middle East, a high of 54° C scorched Kuwait. In the US, several major cities reported temperatures of 38°C and in Europe, Paris reached an all time high of 42.6 °C.\nAnd the list goes on, across Africa, Australia... At 900 km from the North Pole, in Canada, 21 °C was recorded. If anything, these high temperatures, which have provoked severe water shortages in India, for instance, have made people acutely aware that this might be the new normal.\n\nAccording to many scientists, heat waves on a global scale could become more frequent and intense in coming decades. While some of them deny that this hot weather is related to global warming, most see it as an indication of what is to be expected in the future and a direct result of the warming up of our planet.\nThere are a number of immediate measures that can help to mitigate the effects of these high temperatures (planting more trees in urban centres, painting roads white, etc...). In the longer run, however, the switch to using \"clean\" electricity - i.e. generated by renewable forms of energy - is viewed as one of the main ways of reducing Co2 emissions, and thereby reducing global warming.\n\nIncreased energy efficiency is also a way to diminish our global footprint. This can be achieved by all of us on an individual level, but also by the electricity industry and electrical and electronic device manufacturers.\n\nIEC has published numerous standards which pave the way for the use of renewable energies. Several technical committees work on establishing standards for solar modules, wind energy systems, hydraulic turbines, solar thermal installations, wave and tidal converters, etc...\n\nEfficient electrical energy transmission is also encouraged by many IEC Standards. To give just one example, IEC TC 20 recently published IEC 63075 which establishes test methods and requirements for superconducting AC power cables and their accessories. These cables are much more energy efficient than conventional ones."

The conference was held in partnership with the IEC Systems Committee on Smart Cities and the ISO/IEC JTC 1 Working Group on Smart Cities. This is the first time that these two standardization groups have come together with the aim of developing a collaborative approach to producing smart city standards.\nStandards can help\nDuring the conference, Michael Mulquin, Chair of the IEC SyC on Smart cities provided participants with a better understanding of the importance of smart city standards. According to Mulquin, standards are often considered to be about products and process. But they also provide a clear description of agreed best practices. As Mulquin noted, they offer “a common solution for a mutual problem”.\nStandards can also accelerate the move to smarter cities through economies of scale. Mulquin noted that “standards build scale. Many cities implementing the same things will lead to cheaper and better products”. In addition, city planners do not need to worry about being locked into a single vendor or that different technologies will not fit together.\nAccording to Mulquin, “standards offer a consensus-based approach to identifying workable solutions”.  They are considered objective and unbiaised, offering solutions that are trusted. And, with input from city planners, industry and academia, they represent the interest of all parties involved.\nStandards can also provide definitions and frameworks to help smart city planners communicate. Mulquin noted, “they define the key things and concepts within a domain and show their relationships with each other. They help me understand the smart city and talk about it with others”.\nStandards offer a means to measure and guide progress. The use of assessment methods such as indicators/KPIs or maturity models can give a precise measure against which a city can assess its progress.\nWork of IEC SyC Smart cities\nStandards are already vital to cities used for energy grids, lighting, transport and city services. The IEC has identified over 1800 standards that already impact smart cities.\nThe IEC has taken a systems approach to smart cities with the aim of providing a holistic approach to address complex situations. The SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of various IEC committees as well as other groups such as ISO with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of city systems.\nSyC Smart City is currently developing a new standard, IEC 63152, as a best practice tool for city planners. Given the increased frequency of natural disasters and the destruction they cause, this draft standard proposes guidelines to sustain a variety of city services following a disruption. It provides the basic concepts of how multiple city services can cooperate to maintain the supply of electricity.\nIt is also considering work on a smart city reference architecture which would offer practical guidance and methodology on how to achieve the essential characteristics of a smart city."

        "content": "During the XXX FIEE Smart Future exhibition and conference held in São Paulo, Brazil, Amaury Santos, head of the IEC Latin America Regional Centre (IEC-LARC), participated in the panel discussion on Energy Sustainability for Smart Cities.\nThis session examined issues such as urban mobility, clean energy and smart technology systems for smart cities. Santos, in his presentation, gave an overview of the activities in smart cities currently underway at the IEC. As he noted, “cities depend on electricity for everything. Without electricity there cannot be a smart city.”\nThe IEC has identified over 1800 standards that impact smart cities. These include energy, lighting, transport and city services.\nThe IEC has taken a systems approach to smart cities. By doing so, the IEC seeks to provide a holistic approach to addressing complex situations. The SyC Smart cities is active in coordinating the standards work of the various IEC committees as well as other groups such as ISO with the aim of promoting the development of standards to assist in the integration, interoperability and effectiveness of municipal systems. Ultimately, cities are systems of systems.\nData and technology are the foundations of a smart city. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables ongoing data collection and together with artificial intelligence makes possible the analysis of data in real-time. This helps formulate an overall picture of what is going on in a given area and further optimize outcomes. The Joint Technical Committee of IEC and ISO on information technology (ISO/IEC JTC 1) includes several subcommittees which prepare standards on artificial intelligence (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42), IoT (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41) and cloud computing (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38).\nData and technology open up great possibilities but they also increase potential privacy and security risks. Standards such as those in the ISO/IEC 27000 family, can help protect city data and people.\nIn his presentation, Santos demonstrated areas where IEC Standards have provide smart solutions such as in homes and offices, electricity grids, industry and renewable energy. He gave the example of smart lighting which can be adopted in cities and provide such features as lighting on demand, advertisement systems, digital traffic signaling and WiFi access. It is estimated that 6.8 million intelligent street lamps will be available by 2023.\nWhile standards provide product safety and performance, conformity assessment ensures that products adhere to standards. The IEC administers four Conformity Assessment Systems that certify that components, equipment and systems."

Transportation will need to become more sustainable and provide additional added-value services for an increasing number of people.\nOn an individual level, it could herald a move towards cycling or car sharing. However, urban mobility requires a comprehensive strategy that can also bring together the requirements for clean and safe solutions while benefiting from the use of new technologies.\nA new IEC group, SEG 11, has been set up to study the transition towards sustainable transportation. The group will examine the standardization tools needed in order to help countries as they transition towards sustainable transportation solutions.\n“Using a systems approach, SEG 11 will bring together the various elements related to transportation and sustainability in order to capture the full complexity of the issues and propose what is needed at the IEC to foster a holistic solution. This will involve the participation of various stakeholders, including members outside of the IEC community” says Gennaro Ruggiero, Secretary of the SEG 11.\nAccording to Feng Ni, Convenor of SEG 11, “International experts in SEG 11 will examine the key challenges of tomorrow from different angles and how they will affect standardization, incorporating and correlating know-how from the existing landscape of standardisation work on transportation matter at the IEC and beyond”.\nSEG 11 will draft a roadmap on future sustainable transportation. As part of its remit, SEG 11 will collect best practices and use cases of public, shared transportation. It will also engage with IEC TCs/SCs, market stakeholders as well as other organizations, such as ISO, on the status of existing standards and the need for new standards.\nSEG 11 held its first meeting on 8-9 July in Frankfurt. As the Co-Convenor of SEG 11 Alexander Kupfer noted, “During the kick-off meeting, were identified some obvious examples of future, electric-based transportation systems that can accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Participants left the meeting excited and with a clear plan to dig deeper and come back in 18 months with a report and recommendations. Interested in joining? Welcome!”"

        "content": "I was delighted to take part recently in the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) annual Aid for Trade Global Review. Following is a summary of my speech about the role of international standards in helping countries seize the trade opportunities from the clean energy transition. \nStandards are not perfect, but they do reflect known best practices. They provide minimum safety levels, performance levels, interconnection levels and compatibility levels.\nStandards create value, but the highest value comes from the combination of standards and conformity assessment. The IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies that ensure consistent and comparable conformity assessment results from anywhere in the world.\nConformity assessment is used to check that the requirements have been met for goods and services. IEC relies on professional bodies to carry out all the testing and certification, which is very similar to the way in which the IEC develops standards.\nIn developing countries, economic development and progress is strongly linked to electricity access. Renewable energy is a good investment to provide access to electricity in remote and off grid areas.\nAlthough renewable energy projects are long term investment projects, the payback to the local economy can be very fast and sustainable. That’s why clean energy is at the heart of almost all of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\nOne of the most interesting questions I was asked at the event was how the IEC ensures that standards in the renewable energy area do not themselves become obstacles to trade. I simply reminded the delegates of how things used to be.\nFor consumers, there was much less choice of suppliers. Product and service costs were higher and devices didn’t connect together.\nManufacturers had to build the same products to different standards. Since they could not deliver economies of scale, prices were higher and they had greater difficulty entering foreign markets.\nIEC International Standards and the IECRE global conformity assessment services are trade facilitators that bring benefits to consumers and end users. Together these serve as world’s best practices for the management of risk by governments and investors who are funding renewable energy projects.\nWithout this financial risk management there would be less investment, as well as slower development and economic progress. For example, a wind farm with hundreds of wind turbines will need to be maintained over the life time of the installation. This can be 30 years and more.\nWhen the components in the wind turbine need to be replaced, the fact they are built to international standards means their replacement parts can come from suppliers in many different parts of the world. Of course, this only works if the suppliers have built their components to the international standard and those components have been tested and certified.\nCombining international standards with conformity assessment is win-win. It gives the owner of the wind farm the choice of which supplier to use for replacement parts and the supplier of replacement parts gets access to a truly global market.\n \n_______________________________________\n \nAbout the Author\nDavid Hanlon is Secretary of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board"

IEC work is essential in providing safe, reliable and affordable energy services for all.\nLow Voltage Direct Current\nIn those areas where the electricity grid is not yet available, low-voltage direct current (LVDC) could provide a solution for energy access."

        "content": "All businesses face threats on an ongoing basis, ranging from unpredictable political landscapes to rapidly evolving technology and competitive disruption. IEC and ISO have developed a toolbox of risk management standards to help businesses prepare, respond and recover more efficiently. It includes a newly updated standard on risk assessment techniques.\nIEC 31010: Risk management – Risk assessment techniques features a range of techniques to identify and understand risk. It has been updated to expand its range of applications and to add more detail than ever before. It complements the ISO 31000 standard.\nIEC 31010 describes the process to be followed when assessing risk, from defining the scope to delivering a report. It introduces a wide range of techniques for identifying and understanding risk in a business or technical context.\nThe IEC and ISO ‘risk management toolbox’, features internationally agreed standards with best practice and benchmarks on how to manage risk, as well as a risk management framework, agreed principles and processes.\nJean Cross is the convenor of the group of experts who maintain and revise IEC 31010. Professor Cross said, “IEC 31010 is a valuable complement to ISO 31000 by providing detail on how risk can be assessed and describing the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques that can be used”.\n“The standard is useful both as part of a process to manage risk and when comparing options and opportunities so that decisions are based on a good understanding of risk,” she said.\nWhen the only certainty is uncertainty, the IEC and ISO ‘risk management toolbox’ helps organizations to keep ahead of threats that could be detrimental to their success."

        "content": "June is quite a special time of year for the IEC: it was the month the organization was founded back in 1906 and it is also the month of the birthday of the great Victorian scientist and engineer, William Thomson. Better known by his title of Lord Kelvin, he was the founding president of the IEC.\nBaron Kelvin of Largs, to give him his full title, had numerous patented inventions, of which 11 relate to telegraphy, six to dynamo machines and electric lamps and 25 to electric measuring instruments.\n“If you can’t measure things, you can’t improve them,” he was famously quoted as saying. One of the IEC’s core missions, even today, is to provide standards that enable safety and performance measurement for a wide number of electrical and electronic devices.\nFor all IEC technical committees, measurement is fundamental. IEC TC 112, for instance, prepares standards for the evaluation and qualification of electrical insulating materials and systems. IEC TC 1O6 establishes methods for the assessment of electric magnetic and electromagnetic fields associated with human exposure. And the list goes on…\nSome technical committees are even specifically dedicated to developing standards for measurement instruments. IEC Subcommittee 65 B, for example, prepares international standards for devices used in industrial process measurement and control, such as analysing equipment, actuators, and programmable logic controllers.\nHand in hand with measurement goes conformity assessment. The IEC runs four different CA systems which assure that devices and equipment meet the requirements specified in the relevant standards."

        "content": "All of the big trends affecting homes and industry, from IoT and Big Data to smart manufacturing and smart buildings, have one common driver – data networking.\nRegardless of whether the network is cabled or wireless, collected data needs to be carried through networks to be analyzed and dispatched. The work to standardize the interfaces and generic cabling necessary for data networking is undertaken by a joint IEC and ISO technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25, focusing on the interconnections of IT equipment.\nAccording to Rainer Schmidt, Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25, “People are looking for standards to connect the world. When we speak about IoT, much has to do with bringing information, such as temperature or pressure levels, into a given database or network. To do this and make IoT a reality, you need a clear structure to send to other networks”.\nConnecting systems\nThe ISO/IEC 14543 series of standards provides the architecture for the home electronic system. It includes standards for the data link layers, protocols for intelligent grouping and resource sharing as well as remote access system architecture.\nHowever, updates are necessary to ensure that systems accommodate future applications. Schmidt noted that “everyone is speaking about sensors and so we need to introduce sensor upgrades. We also need to address certain aspects of cyber security through robust infrastructure to protect home networks, attached devices and users”.\nCables are often used to connect data networking systems. Generic cabling system standards, most notably the ISO/IEC 11801 series, are suitable for a wide range of applications and are designed to support different hardware, including those expected to be adopted in the future.\nUpdating ISO/IEC 11801 is a priority for Schmidt. He remarked, “this standard is very important because it is the only one defining transmission channels and the limit values on these channels. The defined limit values are used to test or qualify cabling networks and are referenced by many groups such as IEEE”.\nSaving energy\nThe multiplication of electronic devices connected to data networks consumes energy. And, as businesses and homes seek to become more energy efficient and reduce costs, it is necessary to find ways to better manage energy usage.\nOne standard developed by JTC 1/SC 25, ISO/IEC 10192-3, specifies a module to allow the transfer of energy management data between a device and a smart grid using a data network. This allows grid operators to better understand energy demands and improve efficiency. It is a first step towards an interactive system between the smart grid and networked devices.\nAccording to Schmidt, “the environment is an important area where we can contribute. Currently, we are developing a standard for a system of interacting energy management agents for demand-response energy management. This will allow an efficient information exchange from homes to energy service provider that will drive smart home development”.\nSingle pair Ethernet (SPE) with remote powering (i.e. PoDL, power over data line) is another example of how energy costs can be reduced in a data network. By transmitting data and voltage simultaneously, energy costs can be reduced and make batteries in sensors obsolete. Schmidt noted that this is what makes SPE cabling smart.\nNext steps\nAccording to Schmidt, “we are close to the main trends like big data, like integrated industry or industry 4.0 and IoT which are major topics for us. In the next five years, we expect that single-pair cabling, higher bandwidth and technical data security (technical aspects, screening) for data networking will become focus areas for standardization”.\nnmo"

        "content": "The Republic of Nicaragua joined the IEC Affiliate Country Programme in June 2019, bringing to 87 the number of countries in the programme. In total, there are now 173 countries in the IEC family.\nNicaragua, the largest country in Central America, is bordered by Honduras to the northwest, the Caribbean Sea to the east, Costa Rica to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The country occupies an area of 130 370 km2 and its population is 6 085 213 (July 2018 estimate). Its capital and largest city is Managua.\nRegional development in the electricity sector\nThe country’s electricity production was estimated at 4,5 billion kWh, while electricity consumption was 3,6 billion kWh. While Nicaragua is largely dependent on fossil fuels for electricity generation, it is increasingly developing its renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, geothermal and wind. Solar could also be part of the energy mix in future.\nThe Nicaraguan electricity system comprises the National Interconnected System (SIN), which covers more than 90% of the territory where the population of the country lives (Pacific area, central and north zones). The remaining regions are covered by small isolated generation systems. Nicaragua is part of a regional project, the Central American Electrical Interconnection System (SIEPAC), which integrates the electricity network of the country with the rest of the Central American countries. The objective is to improve reliability of supply and reduce costs. SIEPAC, launched in 2013 with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), continues to develop its energy integration process: a feasibility study for the integration of the Mexican electricity market is underway.    \nFirst steps in the IEC family\nThe Direction of Standardization and Metrology (DNM) will assume responsibility for the collaboration with the IEC and offer support as necessary. The contact person is Denis Saavedra.\nDNM operates within the Direction General of Interior Commerce of the Nicaraguan Ministry of Development, Industry and Trade. DNM is in charge of managing and supervising the work of standardization and regulation at the national level.\nThe main objectives of the IEC Affiliates Programme are to encourage developing countries to use IEC International Standards at the national level and to acquire the expertise needed to contribute to international standardization and conformity assessment work. To meet those goals, the IEC helps Affiliates establish the necessary infrastructure, namely a national electrotechnical committee (NEC), involving stakeholders from the public and private sector.\nThe next step for Nicaragua will be to bring together its stakeholders to establish a NEC and start benefiting from what IEC can offer to support electrification programmes and ensure electrical safety for the population.\ncma"

        "content": "Freezing weather and high levels of hydrogen sulphide make the remote Kashagan oil field, in the Kazakh zone of the Caspian Sea, one of the most hazardous environments on Earth. It’s one of many facilities around the world where companies have started to deploy IECEx certified robots.\nWorkers cannot go outdoors without protective clothing and breathing apparatus, which hampers productivity without removing all the risk for humans. A much better solution sees humans stay behind in distant control rooms, while robots perform the most hazardous tasks.\nRobots are widely used in ‘Ex’ environments in a variety of other industries, such as automotive and food. Industrial robots are used in assembly lines, in materials handling, loading and unloading of machines, palletizing, arc welding and painting.\nSpray painting was one of the first uses for industrial robots. Because close contact with solvent-based paint is a serious health hazard for workers, employing robots to perform the tasks greatly minimizes risks to humans.\nManufacturers have designed and produced painting robots that are impervious to paint shop conditions and present no hazard when in proximity to flammable compounds or explosive atmospheres.\nThe robots are sealed, “explosion-proof” units, often pressurized to prevent the ingress of explosive solvents, as stipulated in the relevant International Standards. IEC Technical Committee (TC) 31 prepares and maintains international standards relating to equipment for use where there is a hazard due to the possible presence of explosive atmospheres of gases, vapours, mists or combustible dusts.\nSafety in hazardous environments is non-negotiable. When equipment is not installed, maintained, inspected or repaired by competent persons and according to strict Ex standards, the outcome can be devastating.\nWhile robots may take the place of humans to perform highly dangerous tasks, the human factor has still to be taken into consideration. Even with remote control, a human is still needed to operate the equipment, whether it is a simple painting robot or a highly sophisticated ROV (remotely operated vehicles).\nThis is why it is essential for all equipment used in Ex areas to be designed and manufactured according to very specific requirements.IECEx (IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Explosive Atmospheres) provides certification for areas where there is a risk of fire and/or explosions due to flammable gases, liquids and dusts (Ex areas).\nEx areas are a part of almost every industry, from transport, food production, and textiles to petroleum and mining. IECEx not only covers the broad spectrum of devices, systems and services used in explosive environments, but also verifies their conformity to International Standards.\nThe System addresses inspection (location and other), installation, maintenance and repair of electrical and non-electrical equipment and systems, and assesses the competence of personnel working in this highly specialized area.\nIECEx has been endorsed by the United Nations via the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) as the global best practice model for verifying conformity to International Standards in explosive areas."

        "content": "The ITU opened its AI for Good Summit in Geneva with the goal of highlighting how artificial intelligence can be used to help achieve some of the world’s major objectives, as identified in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIt seeks to connect AI innovations with global problems – like universal access to food supply and healthcare – to find sustainable solutions.\nMany organizations are using artificial intelligence and big data to help them achieve their objectives. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which provides relief to parts of the world subsumed by violence, war and disaster, has identified the potential that AI has to do good. But it has also identified some of the risks.\nNot just data, but people\nThe ICRC is responsible for managing vast quantities of data. Much of this data is sensitive, such as the information it collects during its visits to war prisoners, and its disclosure can lead to deadly consequences to individuals. The ICRC must manage its data with integrity and ensure its proper protection. According to its Director General, Yves Daccord, “it is not just data but people. Our management of data can have life or death consequences”.\nThe ICRC already makes use of big data and algorithms to complement its work. Big data and smart mapping can be used to identify where places where the ICRC needs to provide support. Social media, like Twitter, can help pinpoint problems such as the epicentre of a disease outbreak.\nBut big data and machine learning can also have harmful consequences. The way war is waged is changing and Daccord noted that we “need a principled design of technology. We need to keep human control and accountability”.\nRole of standards\nStandards can mitigate and address some of the concerns around the use of artificial intelligence.\nThe IEC and ISO joint technical committee on artificial intelligence, (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42), was established in 2017, to develop international standards for artificial intelligence on topics such as AI trustworthiness, use cases, applications, governance implications of AI, computational approaches of AI, ethical and societal concerns.\nAs Wael William Diab, Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 noted, “it’s important that we address both the technical challenges as well as the ethical, societal concerns and trustworthiness aspects of the technology. Addressing these technological perspectives from the start by bringing in as numerous and diverse stakeholder views, will enable broad adoption.”\nDuring its recent 3rd plenary meeting in Dublin, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 approved of a new project to develop an overview of ethics and societal concerns in the area of artificial intelligence.\nRelated content\n \nnmo"

        "content": "The American physicist John Bardeen was born on 23 May 1908. Bardeen is the only person to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics twice, for his pioneering work on semiconductors and transistors.\nSince the late 1950s, when they were first exploited commercially, semiconductors have revolutionized electronic systems, transforming communications, signal processing, computing, and control applications for both industry and consumers.\nThe IEC Electropedia defines a semiconductor as a “substance the conductivity of which due to charge carriers of both signs is normally in the range between that of conductors and insulating media and in which the volumic numbers of charge carriers can be changed by external means.” The properties of a semiconductor mean that electricity will only flow through it under certain conditions.\nThey are the key elements for the majority of electronic systems. Semiconductors have given us transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, the solar cell and the silicon chip. They are used in power devices, optical sensors, and light emitters.\nIEC Technical Committee 47, Semiconductor devices, prepares international standards for the design, manufacture, use and reuse of discrete semiconductor devices.  TC 47 develops the IEC 60747 and IEC 62047series of standards for semiconductors.  IEC TC 86, Fibre optics, is responsible for the IEC 61290, IEC 61291, and IEC 61292 series.\nSince the properties of semiconductors are related to the devices where they will be used, different standards address, for example, switchgear and controlgear, converters, and X-ray machines. This means that the standards that apply to the design and test methods for the device also address semiconductor requirements. Other TCs with semiconductor requirements include:\n\nIEC TC 22, Power electronic systems and equipment\nIEC TC 40, Capacitors and resistors for electronic equipment\nIEC TC 82, Solar photovoltaic energy systems\nISO/IEC JTC1, the joint technical committee on information technology established by IEC and ISO\n\nIEC International Standards, together with the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components ( IECQ), offer a unique solution to manufacturers, suppliers and buyers of semiconductors or devices using semiconductors. It is a one-stop shop that provides specifications for the design of products that can then be tested and certified by IECQ.\nIECQ ensures the quality, safety and reliability of all electronic components, monitors and tests the use of hazardous substances in electronic equipment and provides assessment and certification for facilities that handle unprotected ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive devices.\nManufacturers using electronic components and semiconductors or processes related to electronic components covered by IECQ certificates have the assurance that their products will perform as designed and removes the need for prolonged performance testing of componentry and sub-assemblies.\nJohn Bardeen was first awarded the Nobel physics prize in 1956, with William Shockley and Walter Brattain, for the invention of the transistor. His 1972 prize, which he shared with Leon N Cooper and John Robert Schrieffe, was for a fundamental theory of conventional superconductivity known as the BCS theory.\nmmu"

At work and at home, we rely on proper illumination to allow us to continue our activities long after the sun has gone down. Lights provide us with comfort and safety, whether in our homes, walking down a city street or driving a vehicle.\nLighting technology has been updated continuously since Joseph Wilson Swan developed the first primitive light bulb in 1840 and Thomas Edison patented the first commercial incandescent electric light bulb in 1878.\nFrom tungsten filament lamps and the first coil bulbs to modern compact fluorescent lamps and LED light bulbs, lighting technology has evolved to provide better energy efficiency and greater durability. More recently, lighting technology is converging with IoT and artificial intelligence to provide smart lighting solutions.\nLight technology permeates many other parts of our lives. It allows us to scan our purchases at the grocery store. Listen to music on our CD player. We rely on lasers for medical imaging, from MRIs to ultrasounds, and for surgery such as skin and eye treatments.\nLasers are used to cut materials in industrial manufacturing applications and for remote sensing technology.

Its eastern border is formed by a 314 km coastline on the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The country occupies an area of 23 200 km2 and its population is 884 017 (July 2018 estimate). Its capital and largest city is Djibouti.\nClean energy objective\nAccording to the United Nations Statistics Yearbook, the country’s electricity production was estimated at 405 million kWh in 2016, while electricity consumption was 305 million kWh (estimate by the UN Statistics Division).\nWhile still heavily relying on hydropower imported from neighbouring Ethiopia, Djibouti has set ambitious objectives to produce its own clean energy. Sun and wind are abundant in that part of Africa meaning that solar and wind power may be part of the mix, but the country is now focusing mainly on its subsoil assets and developing geothermal plants to reduce its dependence on energy imports. The first project, at Lake Assal in central western Djibouti, consists of drilling four exploration wells for a new geothermal power plant that should be operational in 2021 for a total capacity of 50 MW.\nFirst steps in the IEC family\nThough Djibouti does not yet have a national standards body (NSB), it was able to join the Affiliate Country Programme. Any organization that is entitled to identify and recommend international standards for national adoption in the field of electrotechnology can represent the country within the Programme.\nThe next step for Djibouti will be to bring together its stakeholders to establish a national electrotechnical committee (NEC)and start benefitting from what IEC can offer to support electrification programmes and ensure electrical safety for the population.\nThe main objectives of the Programme are to encourage developing countries to help them become more familiar with IEC work in standardization and conformity assessment, to facilitate the adoption of IEC International Standards as national standard and to acquire the expertise needed to contribute to international standardization work. To meet those goals, the IEC helps Affiliates establish the necessary infrastructure, namely the NEC, involving stakeholders from the public and private sectors."

        "content": "In nearly every city in the world, a new mode of transportation has emerged. Offering a convenient means for travelling short distances, electric scooters are increasingly popular with commuters.\nThey provide an innovative solution to travel distances considered too far to walk yet without requiring the hassle of public transportation or private vehicles. And, with the recent introduction of scooter sharing services, such as Bird and Lime, users can have an inexpensive and easy access to scooters.\nBut electric scooters are not without danger. According to the medical journal JAMA Network Open, more people were injured while riding standing electric scooters than by riding a bicycle or walking based on a study over a one-year period in two Los Angeles emergency departments. One e-scooter sharing service needed to recall certain scooters that malfunctioned and injured riders. And even more traumatic, the BBC reported that a passenger train in the Netherlands collided with an electric cart, used to transport school children, after the cart’s brakes failed to function properly.\nGiven the increased prevalence of so-called personal e-transporters and their questionable safety record, the IEC has set up a new technical committee, TC 125, to provide standardization in the areas of safety and reliability, the protection against hazards, docking stations, recharging and recycling.\nAccording to Luk Van Hecke, who will serve as assistant secretary to the new TC, “there is a need in the IEC for the work of a TC to standardise the evolutions in this market and to guarantee public safety as these devices become more and more common in the public space.”\nThese standards will apply to electrically powered transport devices with one or more wheels where the speed or steering is controlled electronically. It includes electric scooters, monocycles and Segways but excludes electric bicycles, motor bikes or cars since they are already addressed by other technical committees. Standards will only apply for devices used on public roads and spaces.\nIssues that TC 125 will address include:\n\nTerminology of the different personal e-transporters\nReliability of the speed control (acceleration and braking) and steering\nDefinitions of the different safety and reliability levels based on the maximum speed of the device and, subsequently, the different safety precautions. For example, should maximum acceleration and deceleration speeds be imposed or should the weight of the user i.e. whether an adult or a child, impact the maximum speed of the device.\nRequirements regarding visibility depending on where the device is used. This can include requirements to use lights, horns or reflectors.\nProtection against hazards such as fire and water.\nRequirements for recharging and public docking stations.\nMethods for testing safety requirements.\n\n \nThe secretariat of the new TC will be held by Belgium."

It was created in 2014 in recognition that the ever-increasing demand for electricity, and the need to reduce the share of fossil fuels in power generation, have led to rapid development and growth of the RE sector.\nGlasgow workshop will show how standards drive marine energy industry development\nOPERA and MET-CERTIFIED projects both apply IEC standards to real world wave and tidal energy deployments. In a joint initiative the projects will run a free workshop on certification of marine energy converters in Glasgow on 14 May.\n“Certification is recognized as being key for accessing commercial funding and aiding international export. During this workshop experts will explain how the IECRE system can work for different developments and how people can get involved”, says Peter Scheijgrond, Convenor, IECRE Marine Energy OMC Working Group 360 and initiator behind the MET-CERTIFIED project, which is managed by the Dutch Marine Energy Centre.\n“The workshop will highlight the importance of IEC standards for de-risking and commercializing marine renewables and we look forward to sharing our practical experiences from applying these standards in a real world setting”, explains Florent Thiebaut, Senior Project Engineer at University College Cork, and leader of the OPERA project – work package 5, which is focused on applicability and extension of IEC technical specifications.\nMore about IECRE\nThe IECRE System aims to facilitate international trade in equipment and services for use in RE in the marine, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy sectors, while maintaining the required level of safety. Each of these sectors will be able to operate IECRE Schemes that cover products, services and personnel, to provide testing, inspection and certification.\nMore about marine energy projects in Europe\nThe MET-CERTIFIED project, aims to increase the adoption of insurable and therefore bankable marine energy projects in the 2 SEAS region through the development of internationally recognized standards and certification schemes in the sector.\nMET-CERTIFIED is funded by the European Interreg 2 SEAS programme and co-financed by the European Fund for Regional Development (ERFD) under grant agreement No 2S01-020 for the period September 2016 – December 2019. Additionally, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands, Province of South-Holland and North-Holland and the Belgian Province of West Flanders offer financial support.\nThe OPERA project is coordinated by Tecnalia and comprises 12 academic and industrial partners. It aims to develop and de-risk technologies that will reduce the cost of operating wave energy devices at sea by 50% and subsequently accelerate the roll-out of marine renewable energy.\nThe project is a first of its kind to deliver, open access, high-quality open-sea operating data to the wave energy development community. The project has many goals, including reduce uncertainty, frequency, risk and cost of offshore operations; improve risk management and cost estimation with real data and maximize impact on the entire value chain and society for wave energy.\nAPR"

International Standards and conformity assessment are playing a significant role.\nEnergy, and especially electricity, is the common thread of the SDGs, and beyond that, the development of every nation and economy. IEC work provides the technical foundation for the entire energy chain and all equipment that is driven by electricity.\nIt improves the safety of devices, workers and populations, as well as enabling energy efficiency gains and increasing the resilience and long-term viability of infrastructure.\nIEC also operates four conformity assessment schemes, which test and certify that products and services meet IEC standards. The schemes cover electrical equipment and components (IECEE), equipment for use in explosive atmospheres (IECEx), quality assessment for electronic components (IECQ) and equipment for renewable energies (IECRE).\nIn the current issue of the IEC e-tech magazine, we look at how IEC standardization already contributes towards achieving many of the SDGs. For example, virtual and augmented reality (AR/VR) are used increasingly in education (science, maths and languages) and workplace training (surgery, disaster response and maintenance of power plants).\nIn our article Digital learning is redefining education, we discover how standards enable interoperability of soft- and hardware systems, allowing educators and trainers to tailor teaching to the learner’s needs and preferences, as well as broadening access to education (SDG 4 Quality education).\nAs growing populations require more electricity, energy providers are increasing the percentage of cleaner, more affordable renewables into the mix. We look at some of the challenges faced and how IECRE certification of solar PV systems limits risks, encourages investment and instils confidence across the industry (SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy).\nLast year, storms and extreme weather wreaked havoc on many continents, leaving urban and rural areas without power and many vital services. In our article Recovering from disasters, we learn how IEC standards help strengthen disaster resilience of infrastructure, through built-in safety mechanisms and processes, for example, by including external environmental conditions in the design requirements (SDG 13 Climate action).\nRead e-tech here.\n \nmmu"

        "content": "According to an article in the Washington Post, the robot Colossus helped the Paris Fire Fighter Brigade (BSPP) battle the fire at the Notre Dame cathedral.\nWhen temperatures inside the cathedral became unbearable and flames were advancing rapidly, the commander of the BSPP decided that it was too dangerous for his fire fighters to remain. He called on his fire fighters to retreat and instead called on Colossus to help.\nColossus, a 500 kg robot that resembles a small tank, could venture inside the cathedral and use its motorized water cannons to fire more than 2000 litres per minute. This allowed temperatures inside the cathedral to drop and save the two belfries.\nAccording to the company which developed it, Colossus can be controlled from 300 metres away using a joystick. It is waterproof, fire proof and can even crawl up stairs. It is equipped with cameras, sensors and a smoke-extracting fan.\nThe use of robots to survey dangerous situations and venture into areas deemed unsafe for humans is not new. Drones were used by the California Air National Guard in August 2018 to track the spread of the wildfires in the northern part of the state. Equipped with laser range-finders, cameras and infrared sensors, the drones were able to send images to firefighters who could use the information to determine where spot fires were located, develop containment strategies and implement evacuations.\nRobots were first used to explore the wreckage following the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. They have since been used to survey damage after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in Japan in 2011 as well as the earthquakes in Haiti (2010) and Nepal (2015).\nAccording to Brian Lattimer from the safety engineering firm Jensen Hughes, robots will increasingly be equipped with artificial intelligence in order to allow them to operate with more autonomy. As he stated, “eventually, we’ll have collaborative teams of robots – in the air and on the ground – that will work closely with people and reduce the risk to human life”.\nIEC Standards\nIEC produces International Standards for many of the technologies that robots incorporate including sensors, batteries, and semiconductors. The Joint Technical Committee of IEC and ISO on information technology (ISO/IEC JTC 1) and several of its subcommittees (SCs) prepare International Standards which contribute towards artificial intelligence (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42), the internet of things (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41) and cloud computing (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38).\nThe IEC also produces International Standards for much of the hardware components used by robots and drones. These include motors (IEC TC 2), batteries (SC 21A), micro electromechnical systems (SC 47F) and audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment (IEC TC 100).\nIEC TC 31 has developed a complete series of international standards that cover all specific requirements for Ex electrical and non-electrical equipment and systems. In addition, IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards relating to Equipment for use in Explosive (Ex) Atmospheres, helps to ensure ensure that electrical and non-electrical equipment, as well as the people working in Ex locations, benefit from the highest level or safety."

We understood the range of perspectives on AI and ethics issues in countries and organizations around the world. We are now working simultaneously from two sides – the pragmatic needs of industry in terms of incorporating ethics, and the desire of society to see certain values transferred into technology. The two tracks will inspire each other”, said Sebastian Hallensleben, Convenor of the Group.\nIn order to ensure the SEG 10 achieves a truly global perspective, it has dual convenorship with Ms Tangli Liu acting as Co-convenor.\nSEG 10 is tasked with formulating recommendations to the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) on ethical aspects related to autonomous and AI applications, which may include broadly applicable guidelines for IEC technical committees and fostering collaboration between the committees and the IEC and ISO joint technical committee for AI (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42) in this area. Ms Tangli Liu is Co-Convenor\nAI – a global topic with diverse perspectives\nEthics and societal concerns, such as trustworthiness, privacy, security and algorithm bias, are hot topics, as the world embraces AI in many aspects of daily life. Important questions need to be answered to ensure AI technologies deployed in homes, hospitals, schools, universities, workplaces, factories and other public spaces are safe and secure, and that decisions made by autonomous and AI systems are fair and beneficial for all.\nDuring the meeting, there were discussions about standardization activities for AAA in different countries and held a discussion on ethics and AI from different geographical and cultural regions and perspectives. Participating countries included: Argentina, China, India, Israel, Germany, Japan, Saudi-Arabia, Sweden, the UK and the US.\nWael Diab, who leads the work by IEC and ISO joint technical committee for AI (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42), gave an overview of SC 42 activities, which is currently the only committee of its kind to cover the entire AI ecosystem.\nA new working structure\nSEG 10 established a new work structure consisting of three working groups (WGs):\nWG 1: AAA Societal and ethical foundations\nThe goal of WG 1 is to develop a framework/process/approach for applying ethics in different contexts/domains for standardization work.\nSome of its tasks include: clarifying the role and purpose of ethics standards; summarizing the landscape of existing initiatives, and providing an overview of current consensus and challenges at national, regional and global levels.\nWG 2: AAA Specific ethical requirements\nWG 2 aims to identify and prioritize specific ethical requirements of IEC technical activities related to AAA.\nIt will consider items including: investigating IEC technical activities relevant to AAA; identifying applicable cases and stakeholders driving ethical concerns relevant to AAA; engaging all relevant stakeholders (social scientists, philosophers, academia, regulators, IT, OT, end users) and identifying any differences in B2B and B2C scenarios.\nThe next SEG 10 face-to-face meeting will take place during the IEC General Meeting in Shanghai.\nFind out more about SEG 10.\n \n \n \nAPR"

        "content": "The Global Standards Collaboration (GSC) held its 22nd meeting in Montreux, Switzerland on 26-27 March, hosted by IEC and ISO. Over 100 participants representing 12 leading global information and communication technologies (ICT) standards development organizations (SDOs) attended.\nThe event covered diverse aspects related to smart sustainable cities and artificial intelligence (AI).\n“Artificial intelligence offers a lot of promise and will give us a lot of opportunities in terms of how we live, work and play, but it also comes with some challenges, such as trusting and transparently explaining its decisions to the end-user”, said Wael William Diab, who chairs the IEC and ISO joint technical committee on AI (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42), and chaired the GSC session on AI, “SDOs play an important role in addressing these concerns and provide an opportunity for global standards to accelerate adoption of AI in support of the digital transformation.”\nLearning algorithms and machine learning are some of the technologies at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). They are being used increasingly in daily life. For instance, to help healthcare professionals make better decisions for patients and drive higher efficiencies in smart manufacturing, by providing insights for production planning.\nThe list of applications is numerous and growing, including retail, consumer, financial, digital assistants, connected cars, smart grids, market intelligence and more.\nWhy the whole AI ecosystem must be considered\nAI isn’t a single technology, it’s a collection of technologies with numerous and diverse stakeholders, who are approaching the deployment of AI systems from a business angle, in other words, with a focus on customer needs, segments, services, products and regulatory requirements. While these technologies bring many benefits, they also raise a number of concerns.\n“Broadly speaking, these aspects are related to trustworthiness, ethics and societal concerns which must be addressed early on in standards and technology development, so that technology can be deployed widely. This is why SC 42 is taking a very broad approach and looking at the entire AI ecosystem”, said Diab.\nThe session covered:\n\nGeneral and overview presentations on AI providing an update on the various work programmes of the SDOs in this area\nAreas related to the implication and concerns of deploying AI, such as societal concerns, ethics, governance and trustworthiness, along with proposed solutions, standards and mitigation\nApplication areas, representative use cases and related technologies (big data, analytics), to better understand requirements coming from these domains\nPotential synergies and collaboration opportunities between GSC members\n\nFrom developed to emerging markets\nParticipants gave updates on their work, offering diverse perspectives and insights. While some of the challenges differed from regions and countries, the concerns were largely the same.\nYutaka Miyake from the Telecommunication Technology Committee (TTC) talked about the need for transparent and trustworthy AI and machine learning, as Japan implements its “Society 5.0” plan for a super smart society. Miyake highlighted the need to uphold the social principles of AI, which must remain human-centric and accountable, while allowing fair competition for sustainable economic growth and innovation. He also raised challenges around data privacy and security, for example the hackability of facial recognition systems, as well as algorithm bias, which could lead to unfair decisions.\nAs AI becomes embedded in 5G networks in India, it will help improve agriculture, broaden access to education and healthcare for some 60% of remote populations, and be deployed in smart cities and infrastructure. Presenter Samar Shailendra from the Telecommunications Standards Development Society ( TSDSI ) noted the need to focus on continuity of services and coverage, as well as security”. He also talked about ethics regarding job security and stressed that AI should complement people rather than replacing them.\nThe next generation of phones will not be smart, they will be intelligent, enabled with AI and combined with next generation communication networks. They will use huge amounts of data and need to access information more accurately, quickly, automatically and intelligently. Thomas Li from the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) emphasized the importance of getting AI right, noting that standards will need to include AI ethics, security, service application programming interfaces, as well as performance of AI vision, hearing and conversation.\nFinal comments\nDiab concluded, “it was fantastic to see all these SDOs in one room, where the number of ideas and ongoing projects for AI are very impressive”, adding that “standards provide an open platform for innovation and a venue to address the needs and concerns of diverse stakeholders to help advance some of these strategic initiatives we’ve been talking about these last few days”.\nAbout GSC-22\nGSC brings together SDOs from around the world, to promote global cooperation for ICT standardization. Since 1990, it has provided a regular exchange of work programmes and other information in different technical areas.\nFind out more about GSC-22 and its members.\nAPR"

        "content": "Effective use of data can help city residents. This is the case in Seoul where data helped determine the bus routes for the Owl Bus, a late night public transportation service.\nAnalysing mobile phone call volumes collected by the telecom operator KT in combination with on-site research made during the service test phase, city planners were able to determine the most useful bus routes to passengers. This has resulted in impressive ridership rates that are 5% to 10% greater compared with other bus routes.\nBut using data collection and analysis to improve city services is not always straight-forward. Many city services tend to operate in silos using different data formats thus making interoperability and data sharing difficult. These were two of the conclusions from the recent session on smart sustainable cities held during the Global Standards Collaboration (GSC) 22 last week.\nLack of a common approach\nCities are deploying innovative applications to meet their local needs. However, cities, and often each system within the city, lack a common approach to using and exchanging data making the evolution towards smart regions and city-to-city partnerships difficult.\nIn India, the national government has taken an active role in rolling out smart city services. It has launched a competition to select the 100 cities to participate in its Smart City Mission and will invest f₹48,000 crore (USD 6,7 billion) over the next five years. Yet despite this impetus, challenges remain in adopting a data driven approach. According to Jeganathan Ramachandran from Telecommunications Standards Development Society India (TSDSI), “the value of data is not fully realized, interfaces and data formats are not standardized”.\nHowever, as noted by Michael Nawrocki from Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), “cities are beginning to recognize the value of data sharing with other data entities. For economic development, data can be leveraged to provide tools for well-informed policy decisions”.\nHe noted that it remains important to educate policy makers and citizens on the benefits that smart applications can bring and how they can improve city services. However, this task is often made difficult by political election cycles that require short term results and thus hinder long-term planning.\nNeed for standards\nStandards can help serve an important function in allowing for interoperability and the compatibility of data across systems. By 2025, it is estimated that USD 340 billion could be wasted if cities select a fragmented rather than a standardized approach to the roll-out of smart services. Cities can also benefit if they can collaborate with the private sector. For example, governments can help enterprises access data which they can use to offer innovative services.\nAs noted by Lindsay Frost from the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), “the digital transformation is impacting everyone and every standards development organization which makes collaboration extremely important. Smart cities and communities deserve our support. Most of us on the planet will be living there.”\nIEC SyC Smart cities\nIn 2015, the IEC set up a Systems Committee (SyC) on Smart cities with the objective of coordinating the electrotechnical systems standards that are needed to move cities towards greater connectivity, efficiency and safety. Specifically, this SyC works together with IEC committees to develop overarching smart city standards and ensures that existing standards are adapted for the needs of cities.\nIt also collaborates with many stakeholders such as other international standardization bodies, to develop coherent packages of city standards, and city governments and industry, to better understand key city needs.\n \nnmo"

        "content": "Remotely operated vehicles (ROV), often described as “robot submarines”, have been used by the oil and gas industry for many years.\n \nEquipped with very sophisticated electronic devices, they are the eyes, ears and hands of those who operate them from ships or offshore platforms.\nAttempts to develop a ROV were made as far back as the mid-1860s when Luppis-Whitehead Automobile developed a kind of torpedo, the Programmed Underwater Vehicle (PUV). Almost a century later, in 1952, Dimitri Rebikoff built the first underwater scooter which evolved into the world’s first tethered ROV, named the Poodle. In the 1960s, technological advances came from the US Navy. Their Cable-Controlled Underwater Vehicle (CURV) was destined to perform deep-sea rescue operations.\nEssential to the oil and gas sector\nThe oil and gas industry quickly saw a future for ROVs: they could assist in the development and deployment of offshore oil rigs. From the 1980s onwards, ROVs have been used for an ever increasing number of tasks that could never have been undertaken by human divers, from the simple inspection of subsea structures, platforms and pipelines to connecting pipelines and placing manifolds.\nOver the years, there has been a growing need for more powerful and more reliable ROVs that could go deeper and accomplish increasingly complex tasks. One major improvement, in the early 1980s, was the use of control data and video over fibre optic in the offshore oil and gas sector. This meant that ROVs, which previously used data over copper, could operate in greater depths.\nDepending on their category, ROVs may be equipped with video cameras and variable lighting; acoustic and tracking sensors (tracking and measurement devices, scanning sonars, profiling sonars, bathymetric systems and pipe trackers); non-destructive testing sensors used to check structural integrity; cleaning devices (rotating wire, nylon brushes, water-jetting, etc.) to clean offshore infrastructure; and multiple single-purpose or multi-mode work tools; simple bars, hooks and knives.\nToday’s most technologically advanced ROVs, equipped with machine vision and motion sensors, can manoeuvre to a precision of 5-10 mm and attain high levels of safety and efficiency in subsea operations.\nEx-proof equipment\nSensors, connectors, switches or cameras are just a few items that equip ROVs, AUVs and AIVs. When these vehicles are intended for the oil and gas industry, they have to meet very specific and strict requirements to be explosion-proof, as any equipment or material used in explosive atmospheres. The fact that they operate underwater doesn’t make any difference.\nThe IEC has been at the forefront in this field for many years, preparing International Standards and establishing a Conformity Assessment System that provides testing and certification for Ex equipment.\nIEC Technical Committee (TC) 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres, has a complete series of international standards that cover all specific requirements for Ex equipment and systems, from general requirements to protection levels for apparatus used by all sectors that operate in hazardous environments. But producing devices and equipment based on Ex standards is not enough. Most manufacturers and suppliers trade on the global scene and have to meet the very strict requirements put in place by national regulations and legislation.\nThe IEC, through IECEx, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Explosive Atmospheres, has the mechanisms in place to help industry, authorities and regulators ensure that equipment and the people working in Ex locations benefit from the highest level or safety.\nRead more in the latest edition of e-tech."

        "content": "“The convergence of technology brings new complexities. No single standardization development organization can make the necessary standards on its own. We need to work together and cooperate.”\nWith these words, IEC General Secretary and CEO, Frans Vreeswijk, welcomed participants to the 22nd meeting for the Global Standards Collaboration (GSC).\nFrom 26-27 March, the IEC and ISO are jointly organizing GSC-22 which brings together over 100 participants representing 12 standardization development organizations in the area of information communication technologies (ICT) from around the world. Two special sessions will focus on smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI).\nSmart cities and AI\nRecognizing the importance of data in a smart city, the first session will provide an overview of delivering, managing and using data. Interoperability platforms and data exchanges will be presented as well as information on some of the smart cities’ initiatives currently underway. \nThe session on AI will provide an update on current standardization work underway around safety, machine learning, transparency and trustworthiness. The session will also look into AI applications in health, use-cases and future opportunities.\nAs Frans noted, “smart technologies, whether in smart cities or using AI, are pervasive and bring a new set of ethical and societal challenges. We need to be aware of them and address them in a coordinated manner.”\nWorking together\nThe GSC seeks to promote global cooperation in the area of ICT standardization. It brings together SDOs from around the world to strengthen collaboration in areas of mutual interests. Since its founding in 1990, GSC provides for the regular exchange of work programmes and other information in a number of technical areas.\n“This meeting is more than just networking and information sharing. We need to learn from each other,” concluded Frans.\nMembership\nThe following organizations are participating in GSC-22:\n\nARIB – Association of Radio Industries and Business – Japan\nATIS – Alliance for Telecommunications Industry – USA\nCCSA – China Communications Standards Association – China\nETSI – European Telecommunications Standards Institute – Europe\nIEC – International Electotechnical Commission\nIEEE – IEEE Standards Association\nISO – International Organization for Standardization\nITU – International Telecommunication Union\nTIA – Telecommunications Industry Association – USA\nTSDSI – Telecommunications Standards Development Society – India\nTTA – Telecommunication Technology Association – Korea.\nTTC – Telecommunication Technology Committee – Japan\n\n \n \n \n \nIEC"

        "content": "According to media reports, a Chinese surgeon has performed the world’s first remote brain surgery using 5G technology on a patient 3 000 km away. The doctor implanted a neurostimulator into the brain of a patient with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe doctor, who was on the island of Hainan, off China’s south coast, used a computer connected to the next-generation 5G network to control surgical robots in a hospital in Beijing. Conventional 4G networks do not allow surgical operations to be performed due to latency, which is the time taken by networks to respond.  \nMedical robotics relies on IEC International Standards to help ensure that the design and manufacture of parts meet the strictest requirements. The Subcommittees (SCs) and Working Groups (WGs) of IEC Technical Committee (TC) 62: Electrical equipment in medical practice, have been responsible for carrying out the bulk of the medical equipment standardization work required to formulate the IEC 60601 family of Standards. These cover the safety requirements for medical electrical (ME) equipment and medical electrical systems (MES) in current use.\nIEC SC 62A: Common aspects of electrical equipment used in medical practice, formed Joint Working Group (JWG) 9 with ISO TC 184/SC 2: Robotics and robotic devices in June 2011; the Joint Working Group is now linked to ISO/TC 299/JWG 5. The JWG 9 remit is to “develop general requirements and guidance related to the safety of medical electrical equipment and systems that utilize robotic technology. The work encompasses medical applications (including aids for the disabled) covering invasive and non‑invasive procedures such as surgery, rehabilitation therapy, imaging and other robots for medical diagnosis and treatment”.\nSurgical robots incorporate sensors, for example, to relay information or allow levels of force to be applied precisely. Manufacturers can build more reliable and efficient and safer sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) thanks to International Standards prepared by IEC TC 47: Semiconductor devices, and IEC SC 47F: Microelectromechanical systems.\nCurrently, 5G field tests are underway around the world and several operators have already announced plans for commercial rollout later this year. 5G will serve as the communications backbone necessary for the large growth in data and connectivity of today’s modern society, from the IoT with billions of connected devices, to self-driving cars and smart cities.\nWith worldwide rollout planning underway, the IEC is well advanced in the development of standards for human safety and device compliance. IEC Technical Committee (TC) 106 is playing a key role.\nIEC 62232, issued by TC 106, provides methods for determining the radio-frequency field strength near the radio-communication base stations with the intention of evaluating human exposure. This Standard takes into account the mmWave frequencies to be used for 5G networks.\nFor devices, TC 106, together with the IEEE, has established a new joint working group to develop international standards for 5G device testing by 2020 and is developing a Technical Report for publication in the first quarter of 2019."

        "content": "Most people know the IEC develops international standards. Less well-known is that since 1974 IEC has been operating worldwide, global certification services.\nThe IEC Conformity Assessment Systems are a framework of common rules and methodologies, into which professional conformity assessment bodies (CABs), from all over the world work together through peer assessment to ensure consistent and comparable results.\nIEC does not do testing or certification itself. Rather, it is the CABs — professional certification bodies, assessment bodies, inspection bodies, testing laboratories and so on — that do this.\nThis is very similar to the way in which the IEC develops standards. The IEC does not actually write the technical standards.\nRather, it is the subject-matter-experts, from around the world who come and participate in the standards development process, who actually write the standards. The fundamental value that the IEC global CA Systems create is consistent and comparable conformity assessment results from anywhere in the world.\nCABs peer-assess one another internationally, administered by the IEC CA Systems Secretariat. They recognize each other’s results because they know they would get the same results themselves.\nThe results are trusted and no duplicate assessments are needed. Therefore, system components, services and products coming from anywhere in the world that have been assessed through an IEC CA System can be trusted to conform with the required standards.\nIt will not always be necessary to prove conformity with the standard by using third party certification and in many cases a supplier’s declaration of conformity will be sufficient. However as the risk increases, then stronger assurance of conformity will be needed.\nThis means certification by competent conformity assessment bodies and consistent trusted CA results from anywhere in the world. It is the operational model of the IEC global CA Systems that creates value and is considered to be a world’s best practice.\nThis is achieved through two activities. Firstly, all the participating CABs come together to determine a common understanding and interpretation of the standards, as well as common rules and methodologies for testing and assessment all of which is documented into freely accessible operational documents.\nSecondly they conduct peer assessment (they check each other) to ensure that the common interpretation is understood correctly and more importantly, that the common rules and methodologies are being applied. This achieves consistent comparable CA results worldwide.\nThe IEC CA Systems – IECEE, IECEx, IECQ and IECRE – each cover a dedicated segment of electrotechnology. Their ultimate objective is to facilitate global product acceptance by means of one test, one certification and, when appropriate, one mark valid in all markets. 16.8"

As well as representing IEC in various forums in Africa, she is very active in the African Electrotechnical Standardization Commission (AFSEC) where she is a Second Vice-President and Chair of the AFSEC Conformity Assessment Committee.\nWe spoke to Evah on International Women's Day to find out about her work at the IEC, why she chose to pursue her studies in science and how she has been able to overcome the challenges women face when working in technology.\nIEC: Could you describe your job in one sentence.\nEvah Odour: My job is to represent IEC in Africa and provide support to IEC Members and Affiliates in Africa participating in IEC work and in the use of IEC International Standards and Conformity Assessment Systems as the key to safe and efficient access to electricity and to regional and international trade integration.\nIEC: How would your colleagues describe you?\nEvah Odour: Out going, open minded and pleasant.\nIEC: What do you enjoy most about living and working in Nairobi?\nEvah Odour: Nairobi is home, my family is in Nairobi. It is easily accessible from other parts of Africa and it is a pleasant place to be.\nIEC:  You have a Master's Degree in biochemistry. What attracted you to science and technology as a young woman?\nEvah Odour: May be I can say natural selection. I was good in science subjects and I enjoyed them.\nIEC: How typical was your career choice for a young African woman and how much support did you get from family and friends?\nEvah Odour: My career was not very typical and some cases I found myself as the only woman in the class or a working group. My family and friends were very supportive and encouraging\nIEC: What are the main obstacles in Africa for a woman who wants to pursue a career in technology?\nEvah Odour: A woman is still expected to do a lot more work in the home than the male counterpart and a career in technology may demand longer hours and this can be an obstacle.\nIEC: What are the key challenges for people living somewhere like Nairobi?\nEvah Odour: The main challenge for people living in Nairobi is the time it takes to get for place to place because of high traffic jam. The cost of living is quite high.\nIEC: What about businesses – what challenges are they having to overcome?\nEvah Odour: For the business of course moving from place to place is a challenge. When there is a problem with electricity which happens quite often especially during the rainy season then of course business comes to a stand still.\nIEC: In what ways are International Standards having a positive impact in Africa?\nEvah Odour: A lot of countries in Africa are importing (especially electrical products) and not so many are manufacturing. The use of international standards is making it possible to demand safe goods and are thus protecting the consumer and the markets.\nFor the Power Utilities they benefit when they refer to International Standards in their tenders because this provides a reference point for ensuring that you can get a good product at a good price\nIEC: How aware are people of Standards, why they exist and the importance of testing and certification as a means for dealing with counterfeit products?\nEvah Odour: There is a lot of awareness of the importance of Standards as all products (particularly on aspects of safety) must be inspected and issued with a standardization mark and this of course involves testing and certification. A lot of awareness campaigns have been conducted to all stakeholders (manufacturers, consumers and regulators.)"

The JWC is tasked with developing the international standard ISO/IEC AWI 38507, Governance implications of the use of artificial intelligence by organizations.\nThe JWG will draw on the very broad business and IT expertise of SC 40 and SC 42 members and other IEC and ISO technical committees, covering different industries and related  technology areas, such as analytics, big data, IoT, cyber security and more, in order to come up with a guidance document that can be understood by both audiences.\nGuiding governance\n“Time is of the essence and organization leaders need reliable and trusted advice as soon as possible. This new project will use standardized AI terminology and concepts which are being developed by SC 42 in parallel to the JWG development of 38507”, said Jan Begg, Chair, JTC 1/SC 40.\nWith a focus on business and providing a link with corporate governance, SC 40 looks at how technology areas or opportunities are managed within an organization, and then for people with responsibilities at governance level (board or executive managers), how they think about their governance responsibilities when it comes to technology.  Find out more\n“The partnership of SC 42 and SC 40 to address the governance implications of AI, through the joint working group, is an opportunity to expand the stakeholders interested in and involved in AI. Furthermore, it adds to the ecosystem approach that SC 42 has undertaken by bringing in another perspective, namely, governance”, said Wael Diab, Chair, JTC 1/SC 42.\nSC 42 for AI was setup as a systems integration committee to provide guidance to IEC, ISO and JTC 1 committees looking at AI applications.\nAI is a collection of technologies with numerous and different stakeholders who are approaching the deployment of AI systems from a business angle with a focus on customer needs, segments, services, products and regulatory requirements. Thus, it will need industry collaboration across domains, for example, IT and OT for applications in transportation, medical, financial, robotics, manufacturing and more.\nFor these reasons, SC 42 is the first international standards committee to look at the full AI ecosystem and adopt a broad approach that includes and goes beyond traditional interoperability.

It benefits from access to broad, diverse and numerous committees that range from horizontal to vertical areas.\n“The AI ecosystem is ripe for standardization. JTC 1/ SC 42 is the first international standards committee to look at the full AI ecosystem and we’re adopting a broad approach that includes and goes beyond traditional interoperability”, said Diab.\nAI isn't a single technology it's a collection of technologies with numerous and different stakeholders who are approaching the deployment of AI systems from a business angle with a focus on customer needs, segments, services, products and regulatory requirements. AI will necessitate industry collaboration across domains, for example, IT and OT for applications in areas including transportation, medical, financial, robotics, manufacturing and more.\nBy considering AI technologies against the backdrop of market segments and needs, additional synergies are being identified, such as AI, analytics, Big Data, IoT and more.\nTrustworthiness at the heart of AI\nWithin AI there are many issues related to trustworthiness, privacy and security, such as being able to comply with increasing regulations for privacy, addressing bias in algorithms and ensuring mitigation techniques and methods for risks and threats.\nAdditionally other societal concerns and ethics are hot topics which must be considered, such as the ability for AI and IoT technologies to influence and change how we live and work, the impact it is already having on the workforce and economy, as well as the need to ensure all the personal data we generate remains private and secure.\n“In addition to the foundational standards we’re working on, we have three projects on Big Data, two on foundational AI, three on AI trustworthiness, one related to use cases and one on AI governance applications. We encourage broad participation and invite you to get involved in the work through your national standards committees.”\nFind out more about the SC 42 activities"

        "content": "A smart city is a city where improvements in quality of life, city services, sustainability and resilience are accelerated by the widespread and transformative use of data and technology.\nThe reason I like that definition is because it focuses on the things that are important about cities: that cities need to deliver good quality of life and that they need to deliver high quality services in a sustainable way where there’s resilience against any disaster that might come. And they need to do that in the best way possible.\nA smart city understands how data and technology can make that process quicker and more effective. The other key thing is that it is widespread because it’s not just about a city council or city administration being smart, but it’s about how the city administration can facilitate the widespread use of data and technology by everybody in the city.\nIt is popular at the moment to have rankings that say which city is the smartest and which is second, which is the third, and so on. That is rubbish because every city is good at different things. You might get one city that’s really good at making life convenient and easy for the citizen and another city that’s very good at sustainability, and so on.\nWhat you need to be looking at is not a simple system of ranking, but a way of assessing how the city is doing in a number of different aspects of daily life. In this way, the city can understand where its strengths and weaknesses lie, in order to see where it needs to invest more attention to improve things.\nTechnology and data have a pervasive role that is constantly changing as new technologies emerge. Data is getting cheaper and easier to accumulate, to deal with, to cleanse and to analyze. Things are happening all the time. It’s not static.\nCities have always tried to use good evidence to make decisions. Nowadays, data is becoming ever easier to gather and is available not only for use by the humans, but can also be fed into electronic systems that can automatically act on the data that’s coming in and make adjustments to ensure that things continually work better and in the most effective way. This is the key to cities becoming smarter. Data and technology are making it easier to manage the city in a better and more responsive way to help things work properly.\nWhile technology and data open up great possibilities, they also open up the potential for great risks and real damage.  Increasingly, you are seeing convergence where, by being able to link all the systems from the cities, you can help them all work more synergistically and holistically together.\nUnfortunately, they then become much more vulnerable to attack because hackers have more ways to get in and, once they’ve gotten in, they can attack not just one little isolated bit but the whole thing. This is where you need to do a lot of very careful work to make sure that you’re standardizing and not only end to end, but also the whole ecosystem. You have got to think really widely.\nTo make a smart city work there’s lots of good thinking that needs to happen in terms of new technologies and new ways of using data, but also a lot of critically important work on how to manage data and technology to make sure that life is safe and secure for the people who live in the city.\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael Mulquin chairs the IEC Smart Cities Systems Committee.

        "content": "As investment in renewables continues to grow, industry must ensure its equipment and systems are safe, reliable and durable.\nIECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, aims to facilitate international trade in equipment and services for use in RE in the marine, solar PV and wind energy sectors, while maintaining the required level of safety. It applies to products, services and personnel and provides testing, inspection and certification.\nGlobal harmonization through the voice of industry\nI presented the IECRE System during the recent China Wind Power 2018 event. In attendance were 13 financial institutions, including banks, insurance and leasing companies, and the session enabled constructive discussions and for attendees to express their requirements for large-scale RE investments.\nA unique feature of the IECRE System is that all stakeholders have a voice, thanks to the stakeholder groups. This includes test labs, certification bodies, manufacturers and end users. It’s the only conformity assessment (CA) system in which end users can define CA products.\nThere are many benefits of participation, here are some of them:\n\nThe ability to give direct input into what conformity assessment products would best serve your organization\nHaving access to the other stake holder groups\nThe opportunity to share experiences with the largest wind energy companies\nDrive conformity assessment so it will save time and money\nIncreased transparency of the equipment or work certified\n\n \nImproving safety and reducing risk\nThe nature of RE equipment, systems and services is complex. IECRE aims to reduce the risks that come with such complex projects. To this end, discussions in progress with OEMs and certification body (CBs) stakeholders cover:\n\nThe needs of end users for new conformity assessment/certification products\nRefining existing products by commenting on templates and documents\nFinding ways to improve the value of the type certificate by improving the detail provided by OEMs/CBs\nDevelopment and use of the new “Project Design” certificate which is useful for project transfer or sale\nCertifying longer equipment life, as members are now seeing PPA contractual requirements for longer than 20 years\nTechnical assessment and review of projects as they age or are modified\n\n \nAsian financial institutions sign MoU supporting IECRE conformity assessment\nFinancial institutions recognize that harmonized standards and certification contribute to a more transparent and efficient certification environment for all stakeholders. Following the presentations, several Chinese financial institutions and two certification organizations (one Chinese and one American) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in support of the development of IECRE System and in recognition of IECRE certificates and reports.\nThe aim of the MoU is to outline areas of cooperation among the parties, such as communication and supporting development of IECRE system, in order to build collaboration among IECRE, certification bodies and financial institutions and to consider endorsing IECRE certificates and reports as a proof of qualification.\nFind out more the event and what other IECRE representatives had to say.\n \n \nAbout the Author\nWallace Ebner has provided technical risk guidance for AIG Client Risk Solutions wind energy practice for the last nine years and is a member of the IECRE Management Committee for the wind energy sector."

        "content": "Cities are giant systems with countless subsystems. Each is different and needs tailored solutions.\n \nAt the same time cities are all trying to achieve similar outcomes: sufficient fresh water, access to sustainable energy, the ability for citizens to travel efficiently from one point to another, safety and security, economic and environmental sustainability.\nCities need planning to be able to deliver resources and services. They need information and communication technology to enable strong and symbiotic governance, economy and society. However, to become truly smart, reliable electricity access is the cornerstone to achieve sustainable development goal 11 and make cities and communities more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\nIn addition to electricity, cities need sensor networks and hardware such as computing equipment, data and control centres. Interoperability is a must so that new things can be compatible with existing installations and systems from many different vendors.\nIn 2015, the IEC initiated a unique and comprehensive collaborative platform that was to allow standards organizations to identify city pain points on the one hand and to help cities understand how standards underpin solutions to some of their smart city challenges. At the same time the platform was to increase coordination between standards organization so as to accelerate the development of standards for smarter cities and reduce potential duplication of work.\nIn this context, the IEC reached out to ISO and ITU. Together, under IEC leadership, we organized the first World Smart City Forum in Singapore in 2016. It brought together over 300 people live and more than 1000 people online. Participants represented a broad range of nations and expertise, including city planners, regulators, solution providers and standards experts.\nThe second day was dedicated to further explore how SDOs can better cooperate beyond traditional borders. Representatives of IEC, ISO, ITU, IEEE, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI and participants from national standards bodies from more than 30 countries took part.\nUltimately everyone around the table in Singapore came to understand that not a single organization can provide all city standards alone. Increased cooperation between standards organizations is a must and the prerequisite for successful smart city standardization.\nAs an outcome of the meeting we all agreed to uphold principles of mutual respect, transparency, openness and sharing of new work information. We also agreed to create a working group tasked with developing common smart city terminology. The working group has presented their preliminary work last year and you will receive their final report here in Santa Fe.\nThe World Smart City Forum and workshop was not only important for what it accomplished, but also for what it started – a conversation between important standards organizations in a collaborative atmosphere.\nIn November 2017, the World Smart City Forum was replicated under the leadership of ISO and again in cooperation with IEC and ITU in Barcelona. And in 2018 here in Santa Fe ITU has taken on the leadership to bring us all together to discuss what needs to happen next to make smart cities and communities a reality.\n \nAbout the Author\nFrans Vreeswijk has been IEC General Secretary and CEO since 1 October 2012.

        "content": "All eyes are on Katowice in Poland ahead of COP24, due to start on December 2. Climate change, never far away from the headlines, is expected to become one of the major focuses of the news agenda in coming days.\n \nA number of reports were released which paint a dismal picture of the state of the world today and an apocalyptic situation less than a 100 years from now. According to the UN’s Emissions gap report 2018, we are farther than we were last year from meeting the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change,  reached during COP21. More than half of the planet’s richest countries are not cutting their Co2 emissions as fast as they promised under the 2015 treaty. The goal of the Paris agreement is to keep global temperatures rise this century  to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Another report published by the US government, the National Climate Assessment, traces the effects climate change has already wrought upon every US state, from increased droughts and heat-waves, to rising sea-levels and flooding. But its predictions are of utter devastation to come with annual average temperatures expected to increase by 1.3 to 3.7 degrees Celsius by late century.\nWhile these dire predictions are making the news, behind the scenes, scientists, engineers and researchers are working hard to find solutions to help meet the COP21 targets. At the IEC, many experts are working on international standards which should help reduce carbon emissions by making electricity, that green and versatile energy, safer and easier to use for transport,  for instance.  A number of IEC Technical Commmittees (TCs) are working on publications which focus on making the generation and transmission of electricity more energy efficient while others  publish documents which  help to implement renewable energies. They include IEC TC 82: Solar photovoltaïc energy systems, IEC TC 88: Wind energy generation systems, and IEC TC 114: Marine energy- wave, tidal and other water converters.\nThis work also contributes towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 of affordable and clean energy. IEC work enables all forms of power generation for on- and off-grid use and provides the technical foundation for rural electrification, microgrids, LVDC applications for safer, more reliable devices, bringing sustainable electricity and lighting to cities and economies."

        "content": "A new economic model is emerging that re-evaluates our current approach to production and consumption.\n \nIt calls for a paradigm shift across society in which products, components and materials are viewed as regenerative and restorative. An increasingly popular topic, the notion of a circular economy is gaining traction not only among environmentalists and academics but also within governmental and business sectors.\nThe IEC is examining the requirements for the circular economy. Exploratory studies are underway in the Advisory Committee on environmental aspects (ACEA) as well as in IEC Technical Committee (TC) 111 which develops horizontal standards related to environmental issues.  ACEA chair Solange Blaszkowski and with Kaisa-Reeta Koskinen, who leads the new ACEA task force on the circular economy, provided an overview of this topic.\nDefining a circular economy\nAccording to Blaszkowski, the concept of a circular economy is a reconsideration of how resources are managed and how waste is perceived. It affects the entire lifecycle of a product, from initial design and the materials employed to the use of the product, its repair, reuse and the transformation of its parts into a new product. A circular economy is based on the effective functioning of existing (circular) mechanisms such as extending product lifetime, reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacture and recycling.\nKoskinen gives the example of a mobile phone that is no longer needed. Instead of being discarded, it can be sold or given to a family member for their use. Should the phone break down, it can be repaired rather than replaced. Likewise, it can be upgraded to extend its functionality – for example by increasing its storage capacity. Eventually it can be resold or disassembled for the extraction of its parts, some of which will include secondary raw materials that can be recycled and used for other products.\nHowever, the recycling of materials is viewed as a last option since only some of the materials are able to be recovered while others, especially those present in only small amounts, are lost. As Koskinen comments, “it is very easily misunderstood that a circular economy is about recycling. Giving another life to your mobile phone has more value than putting it in a recycling bin where only some materials can be recycled”.\nImplications for manufacturers\nFor manufacturers, the circular economy impacts products from the moment of their initial design. As Blaszkowski says, “you can have a product with a long life but is not repairable for e.g. safety reasons, or a product that lasts less, but is easily repairable. Trade-offs must be made based on product application”.\nMany hurdles exist with current business models. “Business models should be open to making products that are as robust as possible, easy to refurbish or remanufacture or use components that can be retrieved and reused in new or reused products”, says Blaszkowski.\nChanging the consumer mindset\nConsumers will need to change current behaviours such as the continuous acquisition of the latest product models. New habits will need to be adopted such as the repair or upgrade of existing products, the use of second-hand goods and the adoption of product lease models. New services will need to be developed such as shops that can repair or refurbish products.\nEducation will be essential. As Blaszkowski comments, “it is always a question of education and the effort made to educate manufacturers and consumers to get them to learn new ways of thinking”.\n \nRelated content\nRead more about the circular economy in e-tech."

It is even more important to bring the knowledge of the 20,000 IEC experts to help solve city problems.\n \nEven though I have been a committed member of the IEC for almost 5 years, this was my first opportunity to get a sense of the richness and breadth of IEC expertise, and I was so lucky in how I could spend my time. I enjoyed participating in the SMB meeting, the TC and SC officers meeting and the Statutory part of the General meeting, which gave me a good sense of how the IEC functions.\nIt was good to review the potential new TCs, and to find out more about the issues the IEC is grappling with, particularly how to involve more regions, dealing with gender imbalance, and relating the standards work to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It was also encouraging to see the consensus that the IEC is become increasingly open and transparent in the way it works.\nThe Smart Cities Systems Committee ran a one-day workshop, with the help of SEG 8 and JTC1 SC41, to explore how we can collaborate with the other standards development groups in the IEC family. It was a great way to meet lots of experts, who were linking up with the Smart Cities work of IEC for the first time, and we gained some very useful suggestions as to next steps. The experience was enhanced by the participation of a group of Young Professionals, who brought energy and freshness into the discussions.\nI had the chance to take part in the Conference on smart city standards, which gave me a much better understanding of the work of the Korean standards bodies and the way they are working together to develop a consistent set of Standards for cities. Early one morning I had the privilege of being interviewed by Busan’s English Language Radio station and was so proud, not only to talk about the work of our Systems Committee, but also to share my impressions of the wider work of the IEC\nThe climax, of course, was the final open meeting, when everyone was together. For me, the greatest value was the opportunity to benefit from the wisdom of the community in the discussions that were held about the role of IEC in supporting cities in becoming smarter and more sustainable.\nAll in all, a great introduction to the IEC family!\n \nAbout the Author\nMichael Mulquin chairs the IEC Smart Cities Systems Committee.

The Plenary is hosted by the Swedish Standards Institute.\nThis yearly meeting is an opportunity for the country delegates and chairs of JTC 1 subcommittees (SC) to get together to discuss their work programmes. Given the growing workload of JTC 1 and the need to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, the plenary will host two face-to-face meetings each year as of 2019.\nAbout JTC 1\nJTC 1 develops International Standards in the field of information technology (IT) for business and consumer applications. Since its inception in 1987, JTC 1 has published over 3119 Standards and benefited from the contribution of thousands of experts from around the world.\nExamples of some of the areas where JTC 1 has developed Standards include multimedia (MPEG), smart cards, information security, bar codes and RFID, cloud computing and biometrics.\nAnticipating market trends, JTC 1 had recently published a reference architecture for the internet of things (IoT) and set up a subcommittee on artificial intelligence which has already held two meetings this year to define its roadmap for the future.\nJTC 1 is comprised of 22 subcommittees as well as two working groups in the areas of big data and smart cities and a study group on 3D printing.\nShort ‘market windows’\nGiven the rapid development of new technologies, JTC 1 recognizes that timing is very important. Standards must be published within a timeframe that allows new innovations to become widely available in the global marketplace but yet within the framework of safety, quality and consensus that are essential to ISO and IEC members.\nJTC 1 handles complex technical issues where Standards from JTC 1 as well as external consortia must be made to interoperate\nWorking with Young Professionals\nIn his 2018 report to the Plenary, JTC 1 Chair Phil Wennblom provided an update of his activities during the IEC General Assembly held in Busan, South Korea last month.

        "content": "2017 saw the largest ever increase in renewable power capacity, falling costs, increases in investment and advances in enabling technologies, according to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report, by REN21.\n \nSolar photovoltaic (PV) capacity installations were nearly double those of wind power, adding more net capacity than coal, natural gas and nuclear power combined. While this is great news for the renewables industry, complex solar PV equipment and systems raise questions for customers and investors, such as how can they know that a system really is good, and how much more would they be willing to invest to ensure they get a higher quality system that actually yields the projected technical and financial performance – or even more over the long haul?\nMitigating risk through standardization and certification\nThis is where IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications, comes into play. Established in 2014 to address the specific requirements of the solar PV, wind and marine sectors, the system covers the design, manufacture, transportation, installation and maintenance and testing of RE equipment using IEC and other International Standards.\nEnsuring safety, performance and sustainability\nDuring the Solar & Storage Finance USA 2018 event in New York, which aims to help delegates understand how debt providers are evolving propositions for solar and storage projects, and how they can access projects for standalone and co-located projects, I talked about the benefits of IECRE certification for solar PV systems during the session: How can an internationally recognized rating system become a driving force for the energy transition?\nUnder the IECRE System, the entire lifecycle of a PV power plant can be certified (and in future rated), which means the inception and operation phases are covered as well as the secondary market. IEC International Standards used by the System cover many critical design, quality, safety and performance aspects, and the rating system that is under development will help to further the differentiation of quality levels.\nMitigating risks\nThe reality is, however, that performance risks are to be found about everywhere. According to an analysis by TÜV Rheinland, 30% of inspected operating PV power plants (out of a population of approx. 1.5 GWp) show serious defects requiring immediate action and the most prevalent causes of defects are related to the production of components and installation.\nAnother study by EXXERGY analyzing more than 3,600 insurance claim cases reveals that damages can range from just a few EUR/kWp to more than 1,000 EUR/kWp. Therefore, to effectively mitigate risks, the certification of a PV power plant would need a rating system in order to differentiate between different levels of quality, performance, and sustainability.\nWhen managing PV power plant risks, many quality assurance practices seem to serve as viable mitigation measure, but soon, limitations may become evident. If performance deteriorates more than predicted and warranted by the manufacturers, or if at the time of incidental power degradation beyond calculated limits, the manufacturers are no longer in business, serious financial implications may evolve as a consequence.\nBenefits of the IECRE rating system\nA rating system is being developed by IECRE and EXXERGY, using International Standards and complementary expert criteria, in order to help assess the risk exposure that goes along with a PV power plant investment in a more effective and uniform way.\nThe IECRE effort aims to initially concentrate on three ratings (inception phase, annual certification, asset transfer) across three scales: utility, commercial and industrial (C&I), and residential. The ratings would cover the baseline (meaning component manufacturing, EPC, and O&M), the supervision of the project realization phase, and final technical project inspection aspects, resulting in a project rating ranging from AAA as the highest, down to D where the project doesn’t meet standards at all.\nThis way, investors will be able to see how low or high the risk exposure for the particular PV power plant investment actually is from a predominantly technical point of view. We are about to kick off the rating system development project, and while a substantial portion of funds have been committed, additional sponsors supporting the rating development project would be welcome.\n\nMore information\nIECRE\nContact Thomas C.

That was the message of IEC President James Shannon to the Regulator Forum on renewable energy taking place in Busan, South Korea.\nThe two-day forum, taking place alongside the annual IEC General Meeting, is bringing 150 regulators standards developers and industry experts together to discuss closer collaboration to address the challenges and opportunities they face in the area of renewable energy.\nThe integration of renewable energy in the national energy mix represents a number of regulatory challenges driven by such country specific issues as resource access, topology and geography as well as the characteristics of each renewable energy technology.\nIEC General Secretary Frans Vreeswijk defined the nature of the challenge.  “If regulators around the globe spoke to each other more it would make it easier to develop international standards. More harmonization would be a good thing,” he said.\nInternational standards can provide important support to regulators and can help incentivize the renewable energy market by, for example, establishing uniform technical requirements to support the integration of renewable energy into the energy mix of the utilities grid.\nGreater international coordination between regulators and technology developers provides an opportunity for sharing knowledge, best practice and experiences.  During the Forum, participants will learn more about:\n\nIEC work in renewable energy\nHow IEC International Standards and the IEC Conformity Assessment Systems can support renewable energy regulations\nHow regulators can use and reference IEC International Standards to support their work\nWhy it is important that regulators make their needs known and the stages at which their input in the drafting of IEC International Standards is most effective\n\nThe IEC Regulator Forum is an opportunity for a high-level discussion on the ways in which IEC Standards and Conformity Assessment services can be used to help regulators and policy makers assess and manage risks, create transparency, establish clear quality expectations and provide a level playing field for all market members in the area of renewable energy."

        "content": "I recently participated in a panel discussion on smart cities during Open Innovations, an international forum held each year in Moscow.\n \nVladimir Yakushev, the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Utilities of the Russian Federation and other key global figures from the energy industry and the smart cities landscape, participated in the event. My contribution highlighted the important role of International Standards to guarantee the functionality of smart cities and how smart grids can address future energy challenges.\nNo electricity – no smart city\nWe are all familiar with the notion of smart cities and smart communities. What is less obvious is that all of them depend on electricity and hardware such as computers, sensors or displays to move people and things, collect data, exchange and share information.\nElectric power allows a city to function and provide services to ensure the safety, security, comfort and well-being of its citizens. Without electricity, it is simply not possible to build an efficient urban infrastructure.\nCities are giant systems with countless subsystems. An adequate and efficient supply of electricity is the bedrock of all city systems from clean public transportation and smart mobility, to lighting, water management, financial and administrative transactions, safety and waste management. All these can be seen as separate parts but they only work together well if they are properly interrelated.\nThe IEC provides the majority of the International Standards needed to safely interconnect and automate much of the city infrastructure that uses electricity and contains electronics. They cover all forms of energy generation and distribution.\nThe IEC has recently started to examine the operation of smart cities as a whole which has resulted in the establishment of a group dedicated to the standardisation in this area. With a system approach, it is possible to apply a holistic, iterative discovery process to the problems that need to be resolved.\nIt allows for the integration of engineering as well as social and human aspects to bring about solutions that are adaptable, elegant and effective.\nInternational Standards necessary to resolve energy challenges\nThe demand for energy is growing fast, and for electricity even faster. Current energy production methods are unsustainable in terms of resources and the environment.\nThe IEC believes that smart electrification and smart grids will be one of the most significant factors to address the energy challenge. The IEC is in a unique position with its global scope, technical competency and ability to bring together all relevant stakeholders.\nWe serve as a technical facilitator, enabling the preparation of system architectures in all areas where a common lead is needed for the global roll-out of technology-based solutions. In the area of energy, the IEC can help provide solutions to increase the energy efficiency of electrical and electronic systems and products, ensure their safety and guarantee their environmental soundness.\nBringing renewable energy into smart cities\nThe use of renewable energy in cities of the future will require a rethinking of the way we currently understand energy and electricity distribution. Incorporating renewable energy sources in the electric grid, alongside traditional energy sources, will require greater flexibility.\nThe reduction of cost of energy from renewable sources as well as the increased efficiency of power storage and supply units is among the key drivers of rethinking the energy distribution.\nThe dominance of alternating current (AC) over direct current (DC), especially in the “last mile” of the public power distribution network where low voltage is required has begun to be questioned. Many renewable energy sources generate direct current which is also the mode in which operate almost all electronic devices as well as an increasing number of appliances.\nLVDC (low voltage direct current) is attracting broad interest today as it could reduce infrastructure and operation costs. The IEC is following closely these new trends and scoping the need for standardisation.\n \nAbout the Author\nGennaro Ruggiero is Systems Technical Officer at the IEC"

        "content": "On October 14, 1878, Thomas Edison filed his first patent application for “Improvement in Electric Lights”. Lighting technology has continued to evolve over the ensuing 140 years and milestones reached along the way have coincided with key dates in the history of the IEC.\nIEC Technical Committee (TC) 6 was founded in 1919 to carry out standardization work on lamp sockets and caps. The work facilitated the production of the first coil bulbs in the 1920s.\nSubsequent coiled-coil designs greatly reduced the length of the filament in the light bulb, producing brighter light, more efficiently than straight and single coil lamps. The TC was later disbanded and its work taken over by IEC TC 23, created in 1934.\nIEC TC 34 for lamps and related equipment was the first technical committee to be set up after the Second World War. “Engineers from different countries in the lamp industry had always communicated with each other,” explains Horst Porembski, who chaired the TC from 2003 to 2005.\n“That spirit of cooperation survived the war. It was clear to most of them that after having lived through such terrible events, they needed to make their collaboration more official. This led to the creation of IEC TC 34 in 1948.”\nThroughout the 1990s, IEC TC 34 published several Standards relating to compact fluorescent lamps; they have been updated regularly since then. The TC has published several Standards relevant to LEDs from the 2000s onwards, including IEC 62031, which specifies the safety requirements for LEDs and was issued in February 2018.\nIn 2015, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components (IECQ), created the IECQ Scheme for LED Lighting. IECQ can be applied as a means of certifying manufacturers and suppliers of the electronic components, modules and assemblies used in the production of LED packages, engines, lamps, luminaires and associated LED ballasts/drivers. It provides a standardized approach for evaluating suppliers and acts as a powerful supply chain management tool when assessing and monitoring the various tier-level suppliers. It gives consumers the assurance that suppliers who are covered by the Scheme, manufacture products which meet the appropriate standards in terms of reliability, safety and cost-efficiency.\nInside Subcommittee (SC) 34A, Working Group 3 has been set up to prepare and maintain Standards for OLED light sources.\n \nRelated content in e-tech\nThe lighting revolution"

        "content": "According to a recent article in the MIT Technology Review, engineers at Lockheed Martin are wearing augmented reality (AR) headsets to help build the Orion crew capsule.\n \nLockheed Martin is one of the contractors building the joint US-European Orion spacecraft. To help engineers prepare for their tasks or better understand perform certain process, such as drilling holes, they use virtual models that are displayed as holograms in their AR headsets.\nAs one engineer remarked, “At the start of the day, I put on the device to get accustomed to what we will be doing in the morning” and then proceeds with the day’s tasks once it has been learned and instructions confirmed.\nAccording to Lockheed Martin in an article in the Wall Street Journal, the use of AR headsets has allowed technicians to increase their productivity and efficiency. The time it takes for a technician to understand the drilling processes has been reduced from eight hours to 45 minutes using AR headsets. Augmented reality has also helped technicians improve the defect rate since following instructions is simplified.\nBased on the way the headsets are used, it may even be possible to expand their use into space. For example, augmented reality could help astronauts with spacecraft maintenance even while outside of earth’s atmosphere.\nAccording to analysts, the use of augmented reality in manufacturing is expected to increase dramatically in the next few years. Forrester Research estimates that 14.4 million workers in the United States will use ‘smart glasses’ by 2025 compared with 400,000 this year.\nIEC Standards\nAugmented reality applications rely on such components as screens, processors, motion sensors, gyroscopes, cameras and images which are linked to hardware such as headsets. IEC experts are responsible for producing International Standards that make the hardware and software used in these technologies possible.\nThe Joint Technical Committee of IEC and ISO, ISO/IEC JTC 1, provides standardization in information technology. Specifically, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 develops Standards relating to image processing, computer graphics and virtual reality. IEC TC 47 and IEC SC 47F are responsible for the standardization of sensors and microelectromechanical systems. IEC TC 100 produces Standards which contribute to the quality and performance of audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment while IEC TC 110 covers electronic display devices including touchscreens.\nThe IEC has recently set up a Systems Committee (SyC) to coordinate and guide the development of International Standards necessary for smart manufacturing (SyC SM).

        "content": "Renewable energy is increasingly becoming an important source for electricity.\n \nAccording to the Global Status Report by REN21, the global renewable energy (RE) policy network, the year 2017 proved to be record-breaking for renewable energy, characterized by the largest ever increase in renewable power capacity. Investment in new renewable power capacity was roughly double the investment in fossil fuel generating capacity, reaching USD 249,8 billion.\nIn developing countries, renewable energy is providing access to electricity to the millions who are off the electrical grid. According to the Off-Grid Solar (OGS) Market Trends Report published by Lighting Global, the off-grid solar (OGS) sector provided electricity access to an estimated 360 million people worldwide in 2017.\nBut for renewable energy to serve as a reliable source of electricity, it must always be available regardless of the time of day and the weather conditions. It must also be able to cope with variations in demand. For this reason, electrical energy storage (EES) has a key role in ensuring the balance between electricity supply and demand. Electricity can be stored when not needed for use during times of peak demand when the energy generated is insufficient.\nWorld Bank to fund EES programme\nThe World Bank has recently announced that it has set up a programme to accelerate investments in battery storage.\nAccording to the World Bank, battery technology is currently expensive and not yet widely deployed in large-scale projects, especially in developing countries. Yet these countries have great potential for wind and solar power given their natural landscapes and large swathes of the populations live without access to reliable electricity.\nAs Riccardo Puliti, Head of Energy and Extractives at the Word Bank stated, “We are seeing historic low prices for solar and wind energy, and countries want to use as much of it as possible to meet their energy needs. But to make full use of solar and wind power, we need at-scale and affordable battery storage. Our goal is to catalyze new markets that will help drive down costs and make batteries a viable storage solution for developing countries.”\nThe World Bank committing USD 1 billion to finance this programme as well as to mobilize a further USD 3 billion from the public and private sectors.\nIEC support\nThe IEC develops Standards for EES technologies to provide safe and stable energy supply and to integrate electricity from intermittent renewable sources into the overall distribution grid.\nIEC TC 21 prepares Standards for batteries, including safety and performance. It has set up Joint Working Group 82 (JWG 82) with IEC TC 82, which is responsible for solar photovoltaic energy systems, to address secondary cells and batteries for renewable energy storage.\nIEC TC 120 oversees the development of International Standards for all types of EES technologies, employing a systems-based approach rather than focusing on individual energy storage devices.\nIECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, plays an important role when it comes to certifying batteries. The IECEE CB Scheme, through its registered Certification Body Testing Laboratories (CBTLs) and National Certification Bodies (NCBs), tests and certifies batteries against IEC International Standards developed by IEC TC 21.\nIEC also provides support for rural electrification. The IEC TS 62257 series, developed by IEC TC 82, provides best practice solutions to support energy access in developing countries. The IEC, together with the World Bank Group and the United Nations Foundation, provide access to these technical documents at a discounted price to qualifying stakeholders."

        "content": "Like many other industries, shipping is increasingly dependent upon digitalisation and automation. With the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), more systems are being connecting to the Internet.\nA recent study commissioned by Inmarsat earlier this year showed that the maritime industry has one of the most favourable attitudes towards the adoption of analytic, management and operational tools based on the internet of things (IoT).\nA number of reasons have been given for the implementing, or planned implementation, of IoT solutions. They include:\n\nreducing costs,\noptimising shipping routes,\nmonitoring fuel consumption to comply with fuel efficiency regulations, and,\ncutting insurance premiums\n\nWhile the advantages provided by IoT solutions are evident, there is a downside: the risk of unauthorized access or malicious attacks to the ship and its system. Strong cyber security is required.\nA recent presentation by Pen Test Partners (PTP) at the Infosecurity Europe conference demonstrated multiple methods for attacking shipping vessels due to weak default passwords, failure to apply software updates and lack of encryption. PTP was able to do so using Shodan, the IoT search engine which also publishes a ship tracker.\nIn 2017, the AP Moller-Maersk shipping group disclosed that the NotPetya cyber attack disrupted its operations. Costs of this disruption are believed to be USD 200 – 300 million.\nPutting in place safeguards\nIn July 2017, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) published its Guidelines on maritime cyber risk management. These Guidelines provide high-level recommendations on maritime cyber risk management to safeguard shipping from cyber threats.\nThe Guidelines provide a cyber risk management framework that includes:\n\nIdentify: Define roles and responsibilities for cyber risk management and identify the systems that can pose risks to ship operations when disrupted.\nProtect: Implement risk control processes and measures, and contingency planning.\nDetect: Implement actions to detect a cyber-event.\nRespond: Implement activities and plans to restore systems necessary for operations.\nRecover: Identify measures to back-up and restore cyber impacted by a cyber-event.\n\nThe Guidelines also recommend the adoption of ISO/IEC 27001 which specifies the requirements for establishing and maintaining an information security management system (ISMS). The Standard has been developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 on IT security techniques.\nIEC TC 80 developed IEC 61162-450:2018 which specifies interface requirements for communication between shipboard navigation and radiocommunication equipment. An addition to the Standard, IEC 61162-460:2018, is also available should higher safety and security be necessary due to, for example, higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity. Both of these Standards have been published in 2018.\nCyber security is the focus of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) Working Group 17 and IEC Conformity Assessment for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Management Committee Working Group 31."

        "content": "Electricity experts have met in  Côte d’Ivoire to study the use of low voltage direct current (LVDC) to increase access to electricity in rural areas. IEC ambassador Vimal Mahendru was among the IEC experts sharing their experience and technical insights.\nDespite the introduction of direct current (DC) by Thomas Edison over 100 years ago, countries adopted alternating current (AC) given that it could be produced in bigger power stations located in the outskirts of cities and transported over long distances with less expensive cables and at different voltages. However, current trends have reopened the discussions on adopting of DC electricity.\nA recent workshop in Abidjan organized by Codinorm and the IEC provided participants with insight on LVDC and its use to provide electricity access in Africa. Over 80 participants, including experts from Europe, Asia and Africa, led discussions that provided information on LVDC, the work of the IEC in developing Standards for LVDC and a case study on the experience of introducing LVDC in India. The workshop was hosted by the Compagnie Ivoirienne d’ Electricité (CIE) at its premises.\nDialogue between participants was a key part of the workshop. While IEC presenters shared their knowledge on LVDC, they also wanted to learn directly from participants about their country’s current electricity needs. In break-out sessions, participants discussed their contribution to electricity access and their ideas for improving access. Participants also presented the results of group discussions on the various electricity needs in homes, villages and rural areas.\nRenewed interest in LVDC has been sparked by the technology’s suitability in providing electricity in rural areas that are currently not served by the electrical grid. LVDC can be generated anywhere using renewable energy. And because solar, wind and water energy all yield DC electricity, it is more efficient to use the DC electricity directly for DC driven devices rather than converting it to AC and back to DC again. Electricity generated from off-grid, renewable energy can be used for applications such as water pumping and healthcare services.\nIn India, 48 LVDC pilot projects have brought electricity access in areas with diverse geographies. Electricity has been used for pumping water as well as in homes and schools. It is estimated that LVDC electricity has been deployed in 30,000 homes.\nGiven that the standardization of LVDC technologies requires a holistic approach, the IEC has set up a dedicated systems committee (SyC). Using a systems approach, it is possible to examine the properties of the system as a whole and how the parts interact with each other rather than the action of each part separately. SyC LVDC provides guidance on the standardization of LVDC and includes the input from various IEC technical committees including those related to solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems (TC 82), the safety of electrical installations (TC 64) and electric accessories (TC 23).\nMore information on LVDC and IEC standardization is available on the IEC LVDC web zone.\n \nRelated content\nElectricity for the 21st Century—for all"

        "abstract": "A question that I am frequently asked is how well turbines can withstand hurricane force winds...",
        "content": "A question that I am frequently asked is how well turbines can withstand hurricane force winds. The short answer is that International Standards help to ensure that turbines are built to withstand external conditions that may occur over the expected life of the project.\nIn practice, all commercial wind turbines are designed to meet International Standards, specifically IEC 61400 series of Standards. These Standards have been written over the past 40 years by industry experts operating with IEC Technical Committee 88.\nIEC 61400-1 is the primary design Standard that defines the design conditions (“external environmental conditions” combined with a wide variety of turbine operating conditions) that onshore wind turbines must satisfy in order to certification requirements. IEC 61400-3 adds the external conditions that must be considered for offshore designs.\nThese are used by certification bodies to evaluate whether a turbine design does in fact meet the requirements defined in the Standards. Some certification companies have their own internal rules governing how they apply these Standards, but the only internationally developed transparent certification system is the newly developed IECRE system.\nHurricane conditions are not specifically defined within the Standard because they tend to be influenced by local site conditions. Instead, they are treated as extreme conditions on a spectrum of combined weather and sea-state conditions that may be heavily affected by local geographic conditions.\nUnique characteristics of hurricanes and guidance on how to address them in the design process are included in informative annexes of the Standard. Magnitude of winds, waves and other important design conditions are determined by specific site data.\nWhat is required is that every offshore (and onshore) installation specifically defines all the external conditions that may occur at that site over the expected life of the project, usually 30 years but no less than 20 years. This requires the project developer to gather historical data for their site and use it to forecast a set of design conditions which projects the extreme winds, waves, currents, and any other events that the turbines could experience, including hurricanes.\nThis is no different than the design requirements for offshore oil and gas rigs. The overwhelming majority of oil and gas rigs survived Hurricane Katrina. But those that didn’t enabled that industry to re-evaluate their Standards and adjust them to meet more severe 100 year events for future installations.\nMost offshore and many onshore wind turbines are designed to withstand 70 m/s (155 mph, nearly 250 km/h) winds (IEC Class I). This is greater than most hurricanes. Hurricanes do present the most extreme wind conditions, but they are not impossible design conditions.\nJeroen Van Dam, who chairs the IEC technical committee that develops Standards for wind energy generation systems, TC 88, reminds me that the latest revision of IEC 61400-1, which is in its final approval steps, contains a special design class for areas with very high extreme winds, which may result from tropical cyclones, also called hurricanes in the Atlantic ocean. The new design class raises the extreme wind speed that wind turbines are designed for to about 80 m/s (almost 180 mph, around 290 km/h) and allow design for more severe external conditions when needed.\nMore design challenges may result from combinations of wind (less than the extreme wind) and waves together with certain wind turbine operating conditions. Designers simulate many thousands of these combinations with very sophisticated computer models to assure themselves, certification bodies, regulators, and customers that they have indeed addressed all the conditions that could damage the turbines.\nThis has proven to work well as there are many examples of wind turbines surviving these extreme conditions, but it was not the case 40 years ago, before standards and refined dynamics models were available. Indeed the Standards evolved as a result of turbines failing in extreme wind conditions.\nSome countries have their own set of requirements which are a combination of IEC Standards plus national Standards. In the US, experts participate in IEC wind energy Standards development through the American Renewable Energy Standards and Certification Association (ARESCA).\nThe US is currently developing a set of statutory requirements for offshore. Industry experts are meeting together under the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) governed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) rules to develop these consensus-based requirements.\n \nRelated content\nKey role of certification showcased at international marine energy event\nIECRE issues first solar PV certificate\nFind out more about IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications)"

        "content": "Congestion, pollution, bumper-to-bumper traffic and nowhere to park … . The nightmare commute for most car drivers is pushing cities to contemplate new solutions and one of the answers could be the e-scooter.\n\nIn Paris, three ride-sharing companies  have launched e-scooter services in a matter of months, the most recent being Taxify last week. The Estonian ride-sharing company  has integrated the scooter sharing service into its mobile app and is reportedly planning to do the same in other major European towns.\nParis was the one of the first cities to introduce the concept of ride-sharing with the launch  of Velib’ in 2007, which was initially for bicycles. It proved to be immensely popular at the time but  has since shut down and new competitors have entered the game with a plethora of varied ride-sharing services.\nAccording to press reports, Velib’ plans to launch again by the end of the year but with a 30% offering of electric bikes.\nAnother electric option, Autolib’,  based on the concept of sharing electric cars, had to shut down because it was too expensive to run. Studies demonstrated that people did not use the service to replace their existing car. It is likely that the downsides of commuting with a car in a big city, whether electric or not, contributed to the service’s demise.\nFood for thought, as other big cities look at ways of reducing pollution and easing congestion. It would seem that while electric is good, smaller is better for getting from A to point B in today’s megapolises.\nThe IEC has been preparing for the electric vehicle future—whatever the chosen mode of transport —by publishing a number of Standards. Several of these deal with charging and batteries.\nFor instance, IEC 62660-1, which specifies the ways of testing lithium-ion batteries for the propulsion of electric road vehicles. The Standard, the new version of which is about to be released, is prepared by Technical Committee (TC) 21."

        "content": "The integration and alignment of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) in the industrial internet of things (IIoT) has created new challenges for cyber security. That was the key message from a high-level cyber security summit in the Chinese city of Chengdu.\nSenior IEC officials were among the international experts taking part in the event, alongside executives from the Chinese internet giants Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent.\nAddressing the meeting via video link, the IEC General-Secretary and CEO, Frans Vreeswijk, said that security grew exponentially in importance as devices that were once isolated became interconnected. “Bringing the ambitious visions expressed by IoT and the Fourth Industrial Revolution safely to reality will require significant efforts in standardization to enable interoperability and ensure cyber security,” he said.\nDennis Chew, Director of IEC Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (IEC APRC) spoke about the advantages of a risk-based approach based on a holistic assessment of threats and vulnerabilities. Such an approach incorporated technology, processes and people, he said.\nMr Chew highlighted the importance of combining International Standards with testing and certification, also known as conformity assessment, as opposed to treating them as distinct areas. He said that when the risk increased, stronger levels of conformity assessment were needed and that the level of conformity assessment should be appropriate to cover the level of the associated risk.\nThe IEC head of global advocacy, Gabriela Ehrlich, said the emergence of IIoT and the integration of physical machines with networked sensors and software, had blurred the lines between the once separate worlds of IT and OT. She identified the fact that many IT teams had little experience with the physical security requirements of OT systems as a significant challenge.\n“That’s why a purely IT-led cyber security strategy is not appropriate for OT,” she said. The IEC not only provided a framework incorporating multiple Standards covering a variety of IT and OT sectors, she noted, but also an international and standardized approach to testing and certification.\nLi Chunjiang, director of the certification supervision department of the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People’s Republic of China, also underlined the importance of International Standards and conformity assessment in cyber security. Li Keqiang, the deputy director-general of China’s Cyber Security Agency highlighted the extensive participation of China in IEC standardization activities and its Conformity Assessment Systems.\nProfessor Edward Humphreys, who chairs ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27, the joint IEC and ISO subcommittee on cyber security, discussed the global landscape of cybersecurity certification. He said that conformity assessment added credibility by demonstrating that products or services met the needs of consumers and regulators.\n \nRelated content\nThe IEC and cyber security\nThe ABC of cyber security\nRead more posts about cyber security here"

        "content": "It is reported that up to 20% of all phone damage occurs as a result of immersion or contact with a liquid. That is why manufacturers claim their devices are waterproof, but what do the IP ratings they advertise actually mean?\nThe ratings are beneficial to both manufacturers and consumers. They are based on International Standards that enable manufacturers to offer a level of protection that is clearly defined and tested. For consumers, this protection provides a verifiable assurance.\nSmartphones are tested against IEC 60529, which rates their dust and water resistance using the IP (Ingress Protection) Rating code. The standard is prepared by Technical Committee (TC) 70.\nIP 67 vs. IP 68\nTwo of the current, top-of the-range flagship phones are rated as splash, water, and dust resistant to IP67 and IP 68 respectively. The first digit following the IP shows the phone’s resistance to dust and the second to water.\nThey both get sixes, which is the top score, indicating no ingress of dust.\nWhen it comes to water resistance, the scale runs from zero (no protection) to nine (high-pressure hot water from different angles). Both the flagship phones are water resistant, but there is a significant difference between achieving a seven or an eight rating.\nStandards and conformity assessment\nThe IEC provides International Standards and conformity assessment for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. IEC conformity assessment verifies that Standards are properly applied in real-world technical systems to guarantee safety and quality, in this way adding value to products and services.\nThis may mean using different kinds of conformity assessment—ranging from corporate self-assessment to relying on supplier’s declarations to independent, third-party assessment and testing—whichever are most appropriate according to the different levels of risk.\n \nRelated content\nHow to know if your smart phone is *really* waterproof"

        "content": "International experts have met in Chinese Taipei to boost the burgeoning marine energy industry by laying the foundations for a global network of testing and certification bodies.\nThe 5th International WaTERS Wave and Tidal Energy Research Sites workshop was held in Keelung, Chinese Taipei on 6-7 September. Representatives from international open-water test sites attended the event, with the aim of establishing a global network focused on collaborative opportunities for test centres, in support of the developing ocean energy industry.\nWorkshop goals\n\nSharing updates from the last 18 months on progress/challenges from facilities worldwide\nIdentifying common test site challenges and opportunities\nProviding a forum to discuss key R&D topics\nDefining actions to forge relationships and knowledge transfer between test sites\nReducing project risk and attracting investment through certification\n\n \nDutch participant, Peter Scheijgrond, runs the Interreg 2 Seas MET-Certified project based at the Dutch Marine Energy Centre, Netherlands. He is also an active member of the Marine Energy, Operational Management Committee (ME OMC) of IECRE, the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications.\n“IECRE certifies marine energy equipment to IEC International Standards, which cover key aspects such as design, safety, survivability, performance, electrical power quality and more. It offers third party assessment services which are accepted by members worldwide.\n“This is really key when you think that a conformity statement could be issued for a wave energy device on the design verification by a certification body in the UK, when the test report was issued by a Japanese RE test laboratory (RETL), which the client may later use for a project in North America”, said Scheijgrond, highlighting some of the benefits of IECRE certification during the workshop.\nIECRE has recently expanded third party verification of tidal energy devices through the establishment of a new mechanism, which will allow applications from RETLs that cover the power performance assessment of electricity producing tidal energy converters within IEC Technical Specification (TS) 62600-200. The TS gives requirements for site and test conditions, measurement procedures and their exploitation to obtain the power curves.\nBenefits of IECRE for RETLs\nCertification of marine energy projects helps reduce project uncertainty and risk, leading to more commercial and bankable marine energy projects.\nOpen water test facilities for tidal and wave energy convertors and labs for controlled testing have a critical role to play in the implementation of the IECRE ME OMC system. Collectively referred to as RETLs, these facilities can perform accredited tests to assess the performance, power quality, acoustics and loads in marine energy convertors according to technical specifications published by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 114 for marine energy.\nMore about the workshop and international conference sessions\nParticipants from renewable energy testing laboratories from nine countries including in Asia, Europe, the UK and the US attended the workshop, which is supported by Ocean Energy Systems (OES).\nIt was held ahead of the 4th Asian Wave and Tidal Energy Conference. The conference is a platform for engineers, researchers and experts to keep abreast of latest developments in ocean energy, covering wave energy, tidal energy, ocean thermal energy, ocean current energy and offshore wind energy.\nRelated content\nDownload A guide to conformity assessment for renewable energy test labs in the marine energy sector"

        "content": "The new IEC publication on cyber security is an executive introduction to strategy and best practices for decision-makers. Here is a quick overview of the management structure — IEC committees, working groups and systems — not covered in the new brochure.\nIEC advocates a holistic approach to building cyber resilience, incorporating people, processes and technology and combining best practices with testing and certification. The collaboration of the IEC’s Standardization Management Board (SMB) and Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) reflects the systems-based approach adopted by the organization’s technical experts towards developing short, medium and long-term strategies.\nThe SMB has set up an Advisory Committee on Information security and data privacy (ACSEC). Its scope includes:\n\nDealing with information security and data privacy matters which are not specific to a single IEC Technical Committee (TC);\nCoordinating activities related to information security and data privacy;\nProviding guidance to TCs and subcommittees (SCs) for the implementation of information security and data privacy in a general perspective and for specific sectors.\n\nCAB manages and supervises all IEC conformity assessment (CA) activities and represents the IEC CA community. CAB also oversees the four IEC CA Systems but delegates their management and overall operational responsibility to the management body of each CA System.\nCAB has set up a working group, CAB WG 17, to investigate the market need and time frame for CA services (global certification schemes) for products, services, personnel and integrated systems in the domain of cyber security. The working group collaborates with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on a project to create a Common Regulatory Objectives document focusing on cyber security.\nThe objective will be to describe a “world best practice process for a systems approach to conformity assessment for cyber security”, which will be a comprehensive but generic process that can be applied to any technical system.\nIn its analysis of and discussions with different sectors, CAB WG 17 found that there is a convergence towards two main series of Standards, IEC 62443 and the ISO/IEC 27000 family of Standards. The IEC 62443 series focuses on operational technology (OT), which is concerned with keeping cyber-physical systems operating as intended, while the ISO/IEC 27000 family of Standards focuses on information technology (IT), which is concerned about the flow and accuracy of data, data privacy, etc.\nFor a complete cyber security strategy both are needed, as well as some sector-specific Standards, including for example IEC 62645 for the nuclear industry or the IEC 62351 series of Standards for the electrical energy sector.\nIECEE, the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components, has developed a testing and certification programme to address the expanding need for CA solutions related to cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The rules of procedure for the IECEE industrial cyber security programme have been approved by the Certification Management Committee.\nThe service provides a framework for assessments in accordance with the IEC 62443 series of International Standards on security for industrial automation and control systems. This will result in an IECEE certificate of conformity – industrial cyber security capability.\nRelated content\nThe ABC of cyber security\nRead more blog posts about cyber security\nFind out more about the IEC and cyber security"

        "content": "The aim of any cyber security strategy is to protect as many assets as possible and certainly the most important assets.\n \nSince it is not feasible, sensible or even efficient to try to protect everything in equal measure, it is important to identify what is valuable and needs greatest protection, identify vulnerabilities, then to prioritize and to erect defence-in-depth architecture that ensures business continuity.\nYou do not achieve resilience simply by installing secure technology. It is mostly about understanding and mitigating risks in order to apply the right protection at the appropriate points in the system.\nIt is vital that this process is very closely aligned with organizational goals because mitigation decisions may have a serious impact on operations. Ideally, it should be based on a systems-approach that involves stakeholders from throughout the organization.\nA key concept of defence-in-depth is that security requires a set of coordinated measures. There are four essential steps in order to deal with the risk and consequences of a cyber attack:\n\nUnderstand the system, what is valuable and what needs most protection\nUnderstand the known threats through threat modelling and risk assessment\nAddress the risks and implement protection with the help of International Standards, which are based on global best practices\nApply the appropriate level of conformity assessment—testing and certification—against the requirements.\n\nThis is the ABC of cyber security:\n\nA for assessment\nB for best practices to address the risk\nC for conformity assessment for monitoring and maintenance\n\nA risk-based systems-approach increases the confidence of all stakeholders by demonstrating not only the use of security measures based on best practices, but also that an organization has implemented the measures efficiently and effectively.  This means combining the right standards with right level of conformity assessment, rather than treating them as distinct areas.\nThe aim of the conformity assessment is to assess the components of the system, the competencies of the people designing, operating and maintaining it, and the processes and procedures used to run it. This may mean using different kinds of conformity assessment— ranging from corporate self-assessment to relying on supplier’s declarations to independent, third-party assessment and testing—whichever are most appropriate according to the different levels of risk.\nIn a world where cyber threats are becoming increasingly common, being able to apply a specific set of International Standards combined with a dedicated and worldwide certification programme, is a proven and highly effective approach to ensuring long-term cyber resilience.\nThe industrial cyber security programme of the IECEE—the IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components—tests and certifies cyber security in the industrial automation sector. The IECEE Conformity Assessment Scheme includes a programme that provides certification to Standards within the IEC 62443 series.\nCyber security is a key strategic focus of both the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) and the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB). They take a systems-approach to their coordination activities by involving all the IEC stakeholders.

        "content": "Energy efficiency is one of the largest sources of available energy that every country possesses in abundance.\n \nIn simple terms, energy efficiency is the elimination of energy waste. It is the consumption of less energy to perform the same task. For many, it is viewed as an effective means to address environmental and economic challenges.\nAccording to the IEA, we would have used 12% more energy worldwide in 2016 without the efficiency improvements achieved since 2000. This does not imply that less energy has been expended but rather that the usage has been more efficient.\nSince 2000, IEA members have avoided UDS 50 billion in additional spending on energy imports due to energy efficiency. Households have avoided additional spending on their energy bills. Technology advances and policy action have enabled buildings to reduce their energy costs with more efficient heating and cooling systems, lighting and appliances.\nRecognizing the importance of energy efficiency, the European Commission has committed to reducing its energy consumption by 20% by the year 2020.\nAt the IEC, the Advisory Committee on Energy Efficiency (ACEE) coordinates activities related to energy efficiency. It has developed two guides, Guide 118 and Guide 119, which provide guidance to IEC Technical Committees on how to consider energy efficiency aspects when preparing IEC publications.\nEfficiency in the transmission of electricity\nEnergy waste happens at many levels – from its generation and distribution to its final consumption.\nTransmitting electricity over long distances is one example of energy losses that could be remedied. The high current carried in overhead lines and power cables results in increased temperatures, causing energy loss due to the Joule effect. As electrical current passes through a conductor, its temperature rises and this heat then bleeds away as lost energy. Other reasons for energy loss include the dielectric effect where energy is absorbed by the insulating material and magnetic loss where energy dissipates in metallic parts penetrated by magnetic fields.\nThe use of specially-designed overhead conductors can increase the current-carrying capacity and decrease the energy losses of overhead lines. IEC TC 7 publishes Standards which establish the guidelines and specifications for overhead electrical conductors, including calculation methods for bare conductors. IEC TC 20 publishes IEC 60228 which details the requirements of a wide range of conductors of insulated cables. IEC TC 55 prepares Standards for wires, including large insulated and covered wires for power transformer industries.\nMost conductors have some degree of resistance which prevents electricity from flowing effortlessly. Superconductors are materials that offer no resistance to the flow of DC current at extremely low temperatures and minimal losses when subjected to AC currents. IEC TC 90 prepares International Standards relating to superconducting materials and devices, including the IEC 61788 series on superconductivity.\nBecause power loss in high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems is lower than for high voltage alternating current (HVAC) systems over long distances, HVDC is more suitable for extra long-distance transmissions above 3000 km. IEC TC 115 prepares International Standards for HVDC transmission for DC voltage above 100 kV and issues publications addressing design, technical requirements, construction and commissioning, reliability and operation. IEC TC 42 publishes Standards on high voltage and high current test techniques. Its work is also addressing the increased use of DC transmission.\nA new IEC brochure provides further information about transmission and distribution systems and IEC work to help with energy efficiency.\nSee also: Smart grids to tackle energy challenges"

        "content": "According to a new report by IRENA, off-grid renewable energy has had spectacular growth in the past decade. Capacity has tripled since 2008 and the number of people in rural communities served by off-grid renewable energy now reaches up to 133 million people.\n \nThe report demonstrates that off-grid renewables are emerging as a solution to broaden the reach of electricity beyond the grid infrastructure. By doing so, it is helping to expand access to electricity and thus contribute to the UN SDG 7 goal for universal access to clean, reliable and affordable energy.\nAsia is identified as a global leader in off-grid renewable capacity deployment with up to 76 million people benefitting from this energy source. Africa has emerged as a dynamic market with innovative deployment and financing models such as pay-as-you –go and mobile payment options. Currently, 53 million people in Africa access off-grid renewable energy.\nIEC 62257 on rural electrification\nTo help bring electrical energy to some of the 1,3 billion people without access or with only limited energy access, the IEC, World Bank Group and United Nations Foundation have a cooperative agreement to provide developing countries with access to important technical documents that support rural electrification.\nThe IEC Technical Specification 62257 series recommendations for small renewable energy and hybrid systems for rural electrification outlines international best practice solutions to support energy access in developing countries across a range of technologies, including off-grid renewable energy sources. The three organizations are cooperating to offer discounts to qualified stakeholders purchasing documents in the IEC TS 62257 series.\nThe IEC 62257 series contains numerous technical specifications which address three main topics – introduction to rural electrification; project management and implementation guidelines; and technical specifications for components and systems.\nLVDC\nLVDC is a new way of transmitting power that can help remote and rural locations to access electricity. It differs considerably from the conventional centralized model of distributing electricity via alternating current (AC). In the centralized system, electricity is generated in large utility plants and then transported through a network of high-voltage overhead lines to substations. It is then converted to lower voltages before being distributed to individual households.\nWith LVDC, power is produced close to where it is consumed and does not need to be converted for use in households. A number of LVDC projects have been rolled out in India where the technology is viewed as one of the solutions for bringing electricity to the millions of homes which still have limited and intermittent access to power.\nThe IEC has recently set up a Systems Committee, SyC LVDC, tasked with providing systems level standardization, coordination and guidance in the areas of LVDC and LVDC for electricity access."

        "content": "Researchers in Iceland hope that fibre optic cables may make earthquakes easier to detect than ever before.\n \nMuch of the technology that we take for granted in the 21st century relies on fibre optic communications cables, from long-distance phone calls and television services to the internet. Fibre cables laid beneath the ground enable business and industry to move large amounts of data quickly.\nNow researchers in Iceland may have found a new use for the technology. According to an article in the peer reviewed journal, Nature Communications, underground broadband networks could be used in future to detect seismic activity.\nThe challenge is to find a cheaper alternative to expensive seismometers placed at sensitive locations. The research team carried out tests on 15km of fibre-optic cable that had originally been installed between two geothermal power plants, in Iceland, in 1994.\nThe team led by Dr Philippe Jousset, from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, discovered that a laser pulse sent down a single fibre of the cable was sufficient to determine whether there were any disturbances along its length.\nWhen movements in the ground stretched or compressed the cables, the scientists were able to record it. They found that the cables not only recorded seismic signals, but were also able to detect the surrounding faults and other underground geological structures.\nThere are hopes that once refined, the technology could be used for low-cost earthquake early warning systems.\nInternational Standards for fibre optics\nManufacturers and suppliers of optical fibres and their components can rely on the IEC to provide the tools necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of their products.\nIEC Technical Committee (TC) 86: Fibre optics, its three Subcommittees (SCs) are central to the development of the entire sector and all related industries as they prepare Standards, specifications and technical reports for fibre optic-based systems, subsystems, modules, devices and components.\nRecent highlights include:\nIEC SC 86A has standardized the most recent development in wideband multimode fibre, known as OM5. IEC 60793-2-10 increases data rates by augmenting the capacity of each fibre by a factor of four. Because it can be incorporated into existing equipment, it remains compatible with older applications.\nTechnical Report IEC TR 63072-1, developed by SC 86C, provides an introduction to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and describes a roadmap for the standardization of PIC technology over the next decade. PICs bring together optical and electronic functionalities. This technology has the potential to enable computing and data transmissions at great speeds which will be essential for the implementation of the next generation of smart services including 5G networks.\nHigh quality components\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of the components used in optical fibre assemblies, manufacturers and suppliers have a powerful tool at their disposal. IECQ, the IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components, provides certification at the international level for a wide variety of electronic components, including those found in fibre optic systems.\nIECQ offers immediate international recognition. One test and one certificate issued in one country means acceptance on a global basis, even in countries that are not IECQ Members.\nReducing the use of hazardous substances\nNowadays, electronic component manufacturers who have had their products tested and certified by IECQ also request IECQ HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) certification to demonstrate that their products are produced under controlled conditions to provide assurance that they meet hazardous-substance-free specific local, national and international requirements.\nThis is of particular importance for fibre optics as networks increasingly extend across borders. For this reason they have to comply with different national regulations that may restrict or prohibit the use of such substances in components.\nThe IECQ System provides all players in the ever expanding fibre optic market with the certainty of using electronic components that meet the strictest requirements and are of the highest quality."

        "content": "According to a new study commissioned by Inmarsat, the maritime industry has one of the most favourable attitudes towards the adoption of analytic, management and operational tools based on the internet of things (IoT).\n \nThe report, to be published on 26 June and based on 750 interviews, provides a detailed account of attitudes towards IoT and digitalization in the maritime, transport and logistics, energy, mining and agriculture sectors. According to the respondents, IoT solutions will attract a larger share of their IT budget in comparison with other technologies.\nIn the maritime industry, a number of reasons have been given for the implementing, or planned implementation, of IoT solutions. They include:\n\nreducing costs,\noptimising shipping routes,\nmonitoring fuel consumption to comply with fuel efficiency regulations, and,\ncutting insurance premiums\n\n \nHowever, only 25% of respondents are developing new IoT security policies. Yet cyber attacks remain a danger for the maritime industry especially with an increasing number of components that are connected and communicating with each other. Security concerns emerge as larger systems may be targeted through their connected components.\nA recent presentation by Pen Test Partners (PTP) at the Infosecurity Europe conference demonstrated multiple methods for attacking shipping vessels due to weak default passwords, failure to apply software updates and lack of encryption. PTP was able to do so using Shodan, the IoT search engine which also publishes a ship tracker.\nInternational Standards to protect critical infrastructure systems.\nMany organizations rely on the ISO/IEC 27000 family of International Standards for information security management systems (ISMS) to keep their information assets secure. This family of Standards developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27: IT security techniques.\nIEC TC 80: Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems, has developed IEC 61162-450:2016.  In parallel, TC80 has developed IEC 61162-460:2018 to expand requirements when there is a need for enhanced safety and security standards.\nCyber security is the focus of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board (CAB) Working Group (WG) 17 and IEC Conformity Assessment for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Management Committee Task Force."

        "content": "This year’s G7 will address a number of important topics pertaining to greater equality and inclusiveness, security and sustainability. All of these will require concrete actions well beyond governance and regulation.\nFrom understanding issues and identifying opportunities, it is a long and arduous way to delivering the solutions that will make a real difference on the ground.\nEliminating duplication and waste\nToday, literally hundreds of organizations and companies work in parallel to develop the tools, systems and products that will allow humanity to continue to prosper while taking better care of the planet.\nHowever, real life solutions will require broad collaboration between the public and private sectors to help eliminate duplication and wasted efforts. The only tried, tested and effective way to achieve greater efficiency is by applying globally relevant Standards that underpin cooperation and enable the large scale deployment of interoperable technologies and processes.\nAddressing climate change\nPolicy makers will need to push for more efficient use of energy in order to cope with increasing demand for clean, sustainable electricity. Energy efficiency improvements provide a wide range of benefits, including, for example, reduction in GHG emissions, increased energy security, better health and well-being through lower air pollution, positive impact on public budgets and disposable incomes and much more. According to the IEA, energy efficiency represents the biggest still largely untapped source of power.\nInternational Standards provide the solid technical foundation and the metrics to deliver built-in, measurable efficiency gains. They underpin testing and certification and confirm that the efficiency promises of manufacturers are kept.\nIn addition to efficiency improvements, the deployment of cleaner technologies will need to be accelerated. Highly polluting infrastructure will need to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives, bringing on board renewable energy and clean off-grid rural electrification. Here too International Standards will make the life of regulators easier and allow countries to access state-of-the art solutions that are globally competitive and easier to maintain and repair.\nBuilding disaster resilience\nThe number and severity of natural disasters due to climate change is expected to rise. When disasters hit, populations often face aggravating factors such as power outages. When the electricity supply goes, it affects clean water, safe food, sanitation, lights, healthcare, and makes recovery longer and harder. To increase the resilience of infrastructure, reduce disaster impact and accelerate disaster relief, policy makers can count on International Standards and testing and certification. Infrastructure that is built and tested to International Standards is more likely to resist extreme conditions.\nInclusive economic growth\nTo enhance economic growth, many countries need to build quality infrastructure or upgrade existing technology solutions to increase production efficiencies. IEC International Standards together with testing and certification simplify the implementation and upgrading of industrial infrastructure and the retrofitting of clean and environmentally sound technologies or processes. They help increase the safety of tools and of the workers who use them; facilitate technology transfer, encourage innovations that can be exported to many countries and provide easier access to global value chains.\nTools to advance gender equality\nE-learning can facilitate the education of girls and women and provide them with greater opportunities. The IEC provides the technical foundation for most of the electrical and electronic hardware used in education, including computers, routers, printers, mobile phones, etc.\nMany women give birth at home under high risk conditions. Solar lights and safe medical devices can significantly improve outcomes. The IEC prepares the globally relevant Standards for most medical devices used in diagnostics and treatment.\nThe IEC also participates in the International Gender Champions Initiative of the UN and I have been reaching out to all IEC members to increase awareness of the importance of women’s participation in technical committees and to make gender balance a key consideration in the IEC Young Professionals Programme. We have started training technical officers to facilitate a more gender balanced approach in relevant IEC Standards.\n\nThis article also appears in the G7 issue of ‘CLIMATE CHANGE – The New Economy’, the official publication of the G7 summit in Canada."

In toys this could be a disaster if a child dismantles the object and puts the components in its mouth.\nOnce the toy is no longer wanted, there could be problems with handing the toy on, as it could be unsafe for the next child that uses it or it could harm the environment. Manufacturers everywhere are trying to restrict the use of hazardous substances in electronic products and components.\nIECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components) has the perfect solution for toy manufacturers who want to create safe and certified electronic toys that have hazardous substance-free electronic components.\nIECQ HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) is a technically-based management systems approach to implementing and maintaining hazardous substance-free products and production processes. IECQ HSPM was developed in response to the need for component manufacturers to enable suppliers to demonstrate, through third-party assessment, that their electrical and electronic components and assemblies meet specific hazardous substance-free local, national and international requirements.\nIECQ HSPM Certification provides confidence on a worldwide scale that companies operate systems that comply with the IECQ Specification, QC 080000. This specification details the management and technical requirements that IECQ HSPM certified companies need to undertake to provide the market with full confidence concerning the control of hazardous substances.\nThis means that toys using electronic components from suppliers that are certified under HSPM are manufactured with hazardous substance-free electronic components. However, it does not provide parents with the guarantee that their kids won’t tear apart their new cool toy while they’re not looking, resulting in the destruction of their house.\nAs a worldwide approval and certification system covering the supply of electronic components, assemblies and associated materials and processes, IECQ allows manufacturers and suppliers to provide independent verification that the specifications (including IEC International Standards) are met. This gives end manufacturers the reassurance of knowing that suppliers holding IECQ certification do not need stringent second party assessment or monitoring.\nThe plethora of electronic components and processes covered by IECQ are used in all kinds of technologies, from the smallest device to the most complex piece of equipment. IECQ’s contribution to a safer and more reliable world can only increase with the development of new technologies and state-of-the-art electronic devices."

        "content": "It is vitally important that equipment manufactured for the renewable energy sector adheres to strict International Standards. This is much easier to ensure when there is a strong and independent system in place for testing and certification.\nThe IECRE (IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Applications) was created with these challenges in mind. The worldwide approval and certification system relies on broad stakeholder participation to make sure that the certificates meet real needs.\nIt is not only about ensuring that a product or service does what it says on the box, but also about confirming the required levels of safety, quality, efficiency and effectiveness.  \nThe recent issue of the first certificate for best practices in the design, manufacturing and selection of materials for photovoltaic (PV) products was an important milestone for the IECRE. Certificates have already been issued for the wind energy sector.\nThe American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer First Solar, Inc. became the first company to achieve the IEC TS 62941 certificate. IEC TS 62941 has raised the industry standards for PV module product design, development, product certification, process control, raw material control and procurement, as well as for product testing and monitoring.\nThe IECRE System is highly valued because it is based on third–party evaluation carried out by accredited laboratories accepted to participate in the Conformity Assessment System. They provide independent testing and certification, which also reduces costs for manufacturers and consumers by eliminating the need for duplicative evaluations and certifications in different markets.\nThe global safety and certification organization, Underwriters Laboratories – UL (US), issued the recent certificate. First Solar will now benefit from the harmSoaonized certification process for the sector.\nThe IECRE System enables broader industry stakeholder participation in defining the third party certification process, which guarantees the certificates will meet the needs of industry. It reduces costs for manufacturers and consumers by eliminating the need for duplicative evaluations and certifications in different markets.\nIECRE was created in recognition that the ever-increasing demand for electricity and the need to reduce the share of fossil fuels in power generation have led to rapid development and growth of the renewable energy sector.\nThe System aims to facilitate international trade in equipment and services for use in RE, while maintaining the required level of safety and performance. Currently IECRE focuses on installation, equipment and services for use in wind energy, solar PV energy and soon in marine energy sectors.\nEach sector operates Schemes that cover products, services and personnel and provide testing, inspection and certification. The door remains open for consideration of other technologies, such as concentrated solar power (CSP), geothermal energy and fuel cells."

        "content": "Environmental concerns have risen in line with the growth of aviation. Here are four steps being taken around the world to combat pollution and to reduce the carbon footprint of both aircraft and airports.\n \n1. Airports are embracing renewable energy\nAn increasing number of airports have been switching at least partially to renewable energy.\n– Solar energy is becoming an attractive option for powering airports and solar farms have been built on unused land near several aerodromes. IEC Technical Committee (TC) 82 prepares Standards pertaining to the conversion of solar photovoltaic energy into electrical energy.\n– Wind farms are used to power airports, for example in the Netherlands. IEC TC 88 oversees the standardization for wind turbines and the interaction of these with the electric system.\n– Hydropower is another option. IEC TC 4 helps to develop Standards for hydraulic rotating machinery and other equipment associated with hydropower development.\n– In countries surrounded by sea, in the UK for instance, some airport projects have involved the use of marine energy-powered systems. IEC TC 114 prepares International Standards for marine energy conversion systems.\nThe IEC has also established the IEC System for Certification to Standards Relating to Equipment for Use in Renewable Energy Application (IECRE).\n2. Airports are preferring energy efficient LED lights\nLED lights consume less electricity and stay much cooler than incandescent lights, reducing also the risk of combustion.\nLED lights are being used in multiple areas in and around airports to lower the costs of their energy-hungry operations. In addition to multi-storage car parks open 24/7, they are also starting to be used for aeronautical ground lighting (AGL) and to light airports’ indoor facilities.\nLighting can be controlled and adapted to various requirements and if equipped with sensors can automatically switch on and off when required. In addition to the Standards published by IEC TC 34, the IEC’s quality assessment system for electronic components, IECQ, has developed the IECQ scheme for LED lighting.\nIt aims to test and assess the quality of electronic components and assemblies used in the production of LED lamps against IEC Standards.\n3. The airline industry is combatting noise pollution\nNoise pollution is an area of concern for the airline industry.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), environmental noise exposure is responsible for a range of health effects, including increased risk of heart disease, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment among children, stress-related mental health risks and tinnitus.\nIEC TC 29 publishes Standards which measure noise levels. It issues IEC 61265, which specifies requirements for devices used to measure sound for the purpose of aeroplane noise certification.\nThe Standard was prepared in liaison with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN Specialized Agency, and is referenced in ICAO’s Doc 9501, which defines the procedures for the noise certification of aircraft. The ICAO also refers to other Standards developed by IEC TC 29, such as IEC 61672 on sound level meters.\n4. Electric aircraft are being developed\nAirlines, aircraft makers and university engineers are working on electric aircraft prototypes and have already pioneered the take-off of a hydrogen fuel cell four-seater electric aircraft. The IEC has been paving the way for electric fuel cell applications through the work of IEC TC 105 on fuel cell technologies.\n \n[embeddoc url=”https://blog.iec.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IEC_Aviation_A4_En_LR.pdf” download=”all”]"

        "content": "According to the Off-Grid Solar (OGS) Market Trends Report published by Lighting Global, the off-grid solar (OGS) sector provided electricity access to an estimated 360 million people worldwide in 2017.\n \nLighting Global is the World Bank Group’s platform to support sustainable growth of the OGS market as a method for providing energy access to the 1.2 billion people without grid electricity.\nThis report, the fourth in a series first published in 2010, demonstrates the significant changes to the OGS market in the past 7 years. In 2010, the OGS market suffered from low awareness, a single category of lighting products, and a limited geographical presence.\nSince then, the OGS market has grown significantly. Over 130 million devices have been sold with total sales exceeding USD 3.9 billion. New business models, such as pay-as-you-go, have emerged. A diverse and wide range of manufacturers and distributors have entered the market. And investors have committed more than USD 500 million.\nAs a result of the growth in the OGS market, households have been able to save an estimated USD 5.2 billion as they switch from kerosene or other conventional fuels to OGS devices. In addition, 28.6 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided with the uptake of OGS devices.\nThese two figures only include those OGS devices affiliated with the World Bank programme. The inclusion of non-affiliated products would only further increase their impact.\nSimultaneously, the electricity grid in many parts of the world has expanded and now serves nearly 140 million more households compared with 2010. Yet, despite these advances in energy access, the size of the worldwide population that has yet to be served remains unchanged.\nThis is due to high population growth in some of the least electrified regions, the large number of households that have been connected to the grid but with unreliable services and the need for those with OGS devices that need to replace or upgrade their equipment.\nIEC work for rural electrification\nIEC TS 62257 series, developed by IEC Technical Committee 82, provides best practice solutions to support energy access in developing countries. The IEC, together with the World Bank Group and the United Nations Foundation, provide access to these technical documents at a discounted price to qualifying stakeholders.\nThe IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) offers global testing and certification systems based on IEC Standards, to ensure safety, quality, efficiency and overall performance of equipment."
