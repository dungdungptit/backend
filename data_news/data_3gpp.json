        "content": "On the 17th December the 3GPP cricket team, featuring WG delegates, took on the might of the local side, the Orlando Gully Cricketers in a friendly 20 over game.\n3GPP CC’s Alex Hamilton sent us his Captain’s log:\nLike the other players coming from all over the world, to be in Orlando for the week’s Working Group meetings, I too boarded my flight from the UK on a wet and cold Sunday morning, arriving in time for a sunny Florida evening, reminiscent of an early summer evening back home. All that was missing was the Mayfly, early rising trout and young rabbits of my native Hampshire. Instead, I feared encounters with alligators, snakes and hordes of the Disney faithful, in search of Mickey.\nThe 3GPP team played valiantly, with a particular highlight being Jahidur’s half century, run close by the fine fielding of honorary 3GPP player ‘Vicky’-  borrowed from Orlando – who took three catches on the boundary - against his own team!\nAlas, our players were not used to the ball used; a ‘hard tennis ball’ rather than the traditional leather ball, which made for a lot of bounce off the wicket. This meant that the majority of our players got caught out, skying the ball to all corners. A match for this spectacular batting, in the final over of the game, was a real rocket launch from the nearby space centre – Something that made the evening an even more magical experience.\nThe match result was a loss for 3GPP with Orlando winning by 62 runs; but it was a fantastic game and it allowed us to build relationships that help us build the standards.\nAlthough we work in the field of high-performance wireless technology, the agreements and specifications that we make are built by the people. 3GPP is a great place to work, and what better way to build those relationships and bonds than over a game of cricket?\nThanks to our hosts the Orlando Gully Cricketers and to the following 3GPP players for making this happen:\n\nAlex Hamilton (Capt), Nokia, UK\nKiran Polaki (WK), Samsung, UK\nAnuj Sethi, Interdigital, Canada\nJahidur Rahman, Qualcomm, US\nNavaneeth Gopal, Telus, Canada\nSaad Ahmad, Interdigital, Canada\nNandan Das, Viasat, US\nPrateek Mallick, Lenovo, Germany\nTaimoor Abbas, Interdigital, Canada\nYesh Rangaramanujam, Rohde and Schwarz, US\n‘Vicky’, Guest 3GPP member, US\n\nScores - https://3gppcc.play-cricket.com/website/results/6689989\nVideo - https://youtu.be/4j8Ca5iEj9A"

        "content": "Peter Hedman, a leading standards expert in Ericsson and an award-winning delegate in 3GPP passed away on August 30th, following a cardiac arrest suffered while playing the sport of Indoor Bandy with friends.\nAt the opening of the TSG SA meeting this week, Puneet Jain, TSG SA Chair, expressed both shock and grief at the tragic news. Puneet Jain said “I have known Peter since the early Machine-Type-Communications days and he was more than a colleague - he was a dear friend. His kindness, integrity, and unwavering dedication to his work were inspiring. The loss of his presence will be felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him.”\nPeter Hedman was an active delegate in WG SA2 from year 2000 onwards. He was Rapporteur for multiple Study and Work items. In 2021, he received the 3GPP Excellence Award for his dedication and a positive attitude while driving multiple big features such as 5G Network Architecture, Non-Public Networks and UE power consumption.\nKrister Sällberg, Director Telecom Standardization at Ericsson, spoke in tribute and memory of Peter. He told TSG SA colleagues “For twenty-four years, Peter was contributing to three generations of mobile systems as a champion of quality and technical excellence. It is deeply sad that he won’t be here working on 6G with us. Peter was a great colleague and a close friend to many of us, and we will never forget the moments we shared over all these years.”\nAndrew Bennett, SA WG2 Chair said “Working with, and knowing, Peter for more than twenty years has been truly memorable. His technical expertise was remarkable, as was his ability to help the group find compromise from conflict, always with gentleness and humour. It is hard to imagine our meetings without him there.”\nDelegates in attendance last week in Melbourne, for the TSGs#105, observed a minute’s silence in tribute to a respected expert and valued colleague.\nAll in 3GPP send our condolences and thoughts to Peter’s family and friends."

        "content": "On the final day of this week’s 3GPP Working Group (WG) meetings, there is a sense of real progress made, as the breakout rooms start to empty and delegates head back to the full WG sessions. The focus there is on reporting on progress made and coordination to allow the WG leadership to take this week's work forward to the Plenary meetings – TSGs#105 –  to be held 9-13 September 2024.\n \nOver 1,970 experts attended this week in Maastricht, continuing the trend for these WG mega-meetings to be the largest gatherings of the 3GPP calendar.\nThe MECC in Maastricht has been a fabulous location for the late summer WGs. Fine weather and a town that has charm as well as top rate facilities has made the stay here a positive experience.\n \nThe week of technical meetings has also been accompanied by two different community based activities, that provided some memorable moments and a fitting social backdrop to a successful week of work:\n \nWe don’t like cricket – we love it!\nOn Sunday evening a 3GPP cricket team took to the field, to take on the Maastricht Cricket Club (The MCC!). A 20 over game was won convincingly (by 127 runs) by the hosts, but everyone had a wonderful time and there is now a core of players established, that could well result in a 3GPP team playing the great game far afield as time goes by.\nIn a re-run of sorts, the Maastricht Cricket Club hosted a joyous 3GPP evening on the Wednesday – after work. A good natured, but highly competitive match between WG RAN2 and RAN4 resulted in a narrow victory for RAN2, which was celebrated in style by a 50+ crowd of supporters.\n \nBand on the RAN\nOn Thursday, at the close of business, the MECC provided a stage for the RAN2 band to play at the WG’s social gathering. T-shirts were made and delegates contributed to make the evening a magical mix of music, dance and fun-ness."

In this issue of Highlights we have an article by our TSG SA Chair, Puneet Jain – with his feedback on the IMT-2030 Use Case Workshop.\nIn the Technology section we have a variety of view-points. With two articles from our WG SA4 experts on delivering Augmeted Reality and Extended Reality media capabilities to users in real time. We also learn how the 3GPP system will play a growing role in energy delivery – with our article on Network Services and Operations for Energy Utility (NSOEU) – defining how energy utility service providers and MNOs can exchange information in a standardized way.\nAlso in the technical section, we have a WG SA3 article on the influence of 3GPP Security Assurance (SCAS), which is helping to ensure that network nodes are implemented and are behaving according to the specifications.\nThere is more, from our experts, with articles on TSG CT Rel-18 stage 3 completion, on Next Generation Real Time Communication (NG-RTC), on WG RAN3 work for Rel-18 and the WG SA5 work on Management and Orchestration in Rel-19.\nThe partners have helped greatly in Highlights Issue 8, with three diverse articles. The SCF have shared news of their latest collaboration with other open groups. We also have an India perspective on the benefits of Ambient IoT and last up, we have a piece on the procurement practices for critical communications MCx kit from the TCCA.\nSaving the best for last again, we finish this issue with ‘A look inside’, where we have an interview with Diana Pani, RAN2 Chair. Diana shares with us some great insights into the inner workings of the technical groups and how they get the job done.\nAs always, we hope that you enjoy this new issue of ‘Highlights’.

        "content": "The recipients of a major Satellite award have acknowledged the efforts of the 3GPP members and delegates on NTN specifications.\nThe ‘3GPP NTN Standards’ selection as satellite technology of the year was determined by a public vote combined with the votes of the ‘Via Satellite’ publication’s editorial board. The standards proposal was announced as winner during the SATELLITE 2024 conference in Washington this week.\nVia Satellite had selected a short list of five nominees demonstrating innovative new technologies.\nThe ‘3GPP NTN Standards’ nomination cited the proactive engagement of the satellite industry with 3GPP and other forums to ensure that satellite technologies can be fully integrated into the 5G ecosystem. “These efforts have resulted in a major breakthrough: the successful expansion and adaptation of the 3GPP standards to incorporate non-terrestrial networks (NTN) starting with Release 17. Critical enhancements include adaptation for satellite latency and doppler effects, carefully defined to support a wide range of network deployment scenarios and orbits, terminal types (handheld, IoT, vehicle mounted), frequency bands, and beam types (Earth fixed/Earth moving), and sizes.” \nThe nomination highlights how the addition of satellite to the technology mix for 5G has been a major plus for both the satellite and mobile networks. “The standards enable full interoperability between satellite and terrestrial including mobility procedures across both network components, allowing mass-market smartphones and IoT devices to connect seamlessly with both terrestrial mobile networks and NTN-based satellite networks when out of range of terrestrial connectivity. Leveraging the mobile industry economies of scale that come with being part of the 3GPP ecosystem, the new NTN standards will ensure that connectivity can be available to anyone, anywhere in the world.”\nThe 3GPP community congratulated the award winners during the 3GPP TSGs#103 this week, in the Dutch city of Maastricht, recognising the role of the 3GPP Market Partner Global Satellite Operators Association (GSOA) in providing critical insights on business requirements and market needs for the standard.\nThe ‘Via Satellite’ publication lists all of this year’s nominations.\nMore to come\nContinuing the work in 3GPP, enhancements for Release 18 will optimize satellite access performance and new capabilities and services to “further broaden and deepen the menu of options for satellite to play an increasingly central role in global communications in 5G and beyond.”\nSources: Via Satellite (https://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via/march-2024/satellite-technology-of-the-year-nominees-for-2023/)\nUPDATED March 22, to remove specific company names, as not all companies participating in the work were mentioned.

        "content": "The annual Excellence awards for delegates in 3GPP have been presented by the Working Group Chairs during the recent meetings in Seville (SA5) and Athens (RAN2, SA2 and CT4).\nHåkan Palm, RAN2\nAs a leading RAN2 control plane expert and the NR RRC specification rapporteur (TS38.331), Håkan Palm continues to put an enormous amount of work to ensure that the specification continues to be of high quality, accurate, and most importantly that the ASN.1 compiles and can be used by implementations in the field.   \nDiana Pani, WG RAN2 Chair observed that “with more and more features added to NR over the last three releases, the complexity of the spec has significantly increased, and culminated with Rel-18 that introduced an extremely large number of features across all RAN WGs.   As we approach the end of Rel-18, Hakan’s role has to be recognized. The work he puts into his task as rapporteur to keep RRC a world class specification and the work he is currently putting in to organize the ASN.1 review is truly amazing and something which deserves the 3GPP Excellence Award.”  \n\nYizhi Yao, SA5\nYizhi Yao has made major contributions in 2023 on AI/ML management as Prime rapporteur and Management Data Analytics (Phase 2) and 5G performance measurements and KPIs (Phase 3) – both as Secondary rapporteur.\nWG SA5 Chair Lan Zou notes that “In the Rel-18 the ’Study on AI/ML management’ was one of the most complicated topics in SA5. The study was successfully concluded in 2023 with the great coordination efforts from Yizhi Yao. The corresponding work item ‘AI/ML management’ is expected to be finalized within the Rel-18 time frame. Looking forward, during the preparation of Rel-19 work, he has also taken the moderator role to facilitate the corresponding Rel-19 “AI/ML management phase2” topic discussion, managing to reach group agreement on the objectives for further study in the area.”\n\nQi Caixia, CT4\nOne of the major contributors in CT4, Qi Caixia has held a number of work item rapporteurships including EDGE_Ph2 in Release 18. She also holds the pen on several 29 series Studies and Technical Specifications.\n“Qi Caixia has a highly developed moral compass – working respectfully across companies and nationalities to maintain the focus on making world class specifications. Her personality and knowledge impress everyone, she is calm and polite and moves the work forward expertly – Caixia you are the perfect representative of the spirit of this community” said Song Yue, WG CT4 Chair.\n\nJinguo Zhu, SA2\n“Jinguo has played a very active role in both the completion of Release 18 and the content definition of Release 19 this year. He always behaves in a fair, calm and consensus-building way, even when controversial issues need to be handled in high-pressure situations.” says Andrew Bennett, WG SA2 Chair.\nHe was Moderator of two Rel-19 SID candidates during Q3 and Q4 – The study on ‘UPF enhancement for Exposure’ and ‘SBA Phase 2, Study on Improvements of network controlled Network Slice Selection’.\nJinguo Zhu was also Rapporteur of a TEI18 item ‘Enhancement of NSAC for maximum number of UEs with at least one PDU session/PDN connection’ and Primary rapporteur for Network Slicing Phase 3, continuing his long-standing and active leadership of this complex topic over a number of releases.\nSee the complete 3GPP Excellence Award Roll-of-honour at https://www.3gpp.org/about-us/achievement-awards/excellence-award"

        "content": "As the project celebrates the 25th anniversary of the signing of the 3GPP Project Agreement, the 3GPP Organizational Partners have today issued the following joint press release.\nDecember 4, 2023 \nWith its work on 3G, 4G and 5G specifications used by billions of communications services consumers globally, 3GPP stands ready to create the 6G future.\n3GPP Organizational Partners: ARIB, ATIS, CCSA, ETSI, TSDSI, TTA and TTC today announced that 3GPP will develop the next generation of global communications specifications.  Based on its success over several technology generations — from 3G to 5G — 3GPP is uniquely positioned to develop the standard for the sixth generation of mobile systems or “6G”. The organization’s consensus-based process delivers the critical technical specifications that provide a complete system description for the mobile networks that billions of users depend on.\n3GPP is currently at work on Release 18 and will soon begin development of Release 19 of its specifications, which relate to 5G-Advanced. However, delivery of a new mobile generation is a multi-year process. That is why the work for the 6G specifications is being planned well in advance. 5G brought increased interest in 3GPP, with the organization growing to meet the demands of more sectors and new services. Further growth may be expected as the needs of 6G use cases are considered in the standards development process.\nSince its inception, 3GPP has successfully delivered on the promise of cellular communications. The Organizational Partners in the project now stand ready to embark on the planning for the next generation, 6G.\n\n \n3GPP Partner Quotes\n“Mobile communication systems have been positioned as an essential platform for our society and economy, and we believe this trend will further increase with 6G. For mobile communication systems from 3G to 5G, 3GPP has also worked with ITU to strongly promote standardization development all over the world. Through this commitment, the 3GPP organizational partners will work together to develop 6G which will bring more values to all of us with global standard.”\nSeiji Nishioka, Executive Director, ARIB \n\n“Mobile technology uniquely underpins innovation in many parts of society and the global economy. 3GPP’s ongoing 5G work delivers valuable technology for global customers. Further improvements through the 5G Advanced lifecycle will help ensure 5G’s operational importance. Looking forward, industry, users and government have expressed growing interest in 6G’s potential to not only deliver new services but to optimize existing ones. ATIS’ Next G Alliance has developed a comprehensive 6G roadmap for North America that will serve as a basis for our input to 3GPP global 6G standardization.”\nSusan Miller, ATIS President and CEO\n\n“Global harmonization of standards is the foundation to the success of the mobile communication industry. 3GPP has developed international standards from 3G to 5G，creating significant economical and societal values to the world. With strong commitment from partners, 3GPP will continuously drive the successful development of 6G global harmonized standards.”\nWen Ku，CCSA Board Chair\n\n“Success is something that we must work to maintain. Our future success is best served by the partner’s commitment to making 3GPP fit-for-purpose for the next phase of the system’s development. Our early commitment to this cause is a strong marker for the exciting road ahead – towards 6G.”\nLuis Jorge Romero, ETSI Director General\n\n“With 5G networks rapidly rolling out, global research into technologies that will support emerging use cases for the next generation of mobile communications is already underway. Over its two-and-a-half-decade journey, 3GPP has seen an ever-growing number of stakeholders consistently expressing high confidence in its ability to deliver impeccable mobile communication standards across multiple generations. Consequently, 3GPP stands as the natural choice for all stakeholders to come together and collaborate on the development of 6G standards.”\nN. G. Subramaniam, Chair, TSDSI\n\n“Today signifies a historic milestone in the journey towards 6G for digital transformation. With the release of this unified commitment, we, the 3GPP partners, reaffirm our dedication to driving the advancement of 6G standardization, which will pave the way for a new era of sustainability and technological innovation. Let's come together with 3GPP to shape the 6G standard.”\nKyoungCheol Koo, TTA Vice President\n\n“Mobile communications technology underpins people's lives and social and economic activities around the world. By developing the international standards for mobile communications, from one generation to the next, 3GPP has made enormous contributions to global mobile networks, helping to create better societies and improve people's welfare.\nMoving towards 6G, we the 3GPP partners, reassert our commitment to developing 6G standards that will enable wider uses of more innovative technologies in various aspects of the society. We hope that stakeholders across the globe will join 3GPP’s 6G standardization activities.” \nHideyuki Iwata, President, Director General, TTC\n\nNotes to editors\nThe Partners - Organizational Partners are the seven regional and national standards development organizations that determine the general policy and strategy of 3GPP and perform the necessary tasks to keep the project on track (See https://www.3gpp.org/about-us/partners).\nIndustry members join the project via their membership of one or more of these OPs.\n "

The groups handle thousands of documents, during specification drafting sessions that are preparing the way for the final approval and functional freeze of Release 18 by March 2024 (TSGs #103, Maastricht). The priorities for Release 19 have also been discussed, with firm decisions on what will feature in Rel-19 to be made at the up-coming Plenaries in December 2023 (TSGs #102, Edinburgh).\nIn the build up to the WG meetings this week, ATIS provided an online tool to help delegates find good accommodation and details about the meeting venues and their surroundings. The success of the meetings website https://3gppmeetings.atis.org/ has allowed ATIS to establish a template for meeting support that will now go forward to future meeting’s planning. The next ATIS hosted gathering of this size will be the 3GPP Working Group Meetings in Orlando, in November 2024.\n \n* Text updated Nov. 20 to correct the number of delegates (previously noted as 1400+).

In recognition for having consistently driven progress on key features in the group in 2022, the WG SA2 Chair, Puneet Jain, observed “Tricci So is an outstanding delegate often sought out by peers and senior 3GPP leaders on questions related to 5G Network Slicing, ATSSS and AI/ML based Services support in 3GPP.”\nThe Chair of WG RAN1 - Younsun Kim - was proud to announce that the success of the group in sweeping up an award in all but one year since the Excellence Award was created in 2012 continues. For 2022, it is Yanping Xing, China Academy of Telecommunications Technology (CATT), who is recognised. Her work as feature lead for the NR Duplex study item (sub-band full duplex) and her safe hands in the finalization of the Release 17 work for Industrial IoT & URLLC, on time and with highly functional specifications were two strong factors in the award panel’s decision. Younsun Kim emphasised Yanping Xing’s technical expertise and willingness to collaborate as a catalyst in making progress. In his nomination for the award, the Chair observed “Without delegates such as Yanping the quality of RAN1 specifications would not be where it stands today.”\nIn WG RAN3, Gino Masini of Ericsson has been awarded his Excellence Award.  His role in the definition of the electronic meeting rules, to facilitate the WG’s e-meetings, has greatly helped RAN3 through the pandemic period.  The group’s Chair, Yin Gao, said “Gino has been a main point of reference in RAN3 for technical discussions, but also for the coordination with other 3GPP groups and with external bodies, including IETF. His valuable contribution in the alignment of our technical deliverables with the need for inclusive language has also been a great help to us all.”\nFrédéric Gabin, the Chair of WG SA4, supported the award nomination for the BBC’s Richard Bradbury, for his key contribution as Editor of the Rel-17 specification for EVEX (5GMS AF Event Exposure) in TS 26.531. The Chair congratulated him on his outstanding coordination efforts and his participation in joint specification development, with the other 3GPP Working Groups.\nRichard Bradbury also contributed numerous improvements to 5G Media Streaming and worked on 5G Multicast-Broadcast User Service Architecture, Streaming Architecture extensions For Edge processing, Operation Points for 8K VR 360 Video over 5G, Multicast-Broadcast Protocols as well as  recent progress on Media Production over 5G private networks.\nThe SA4 award handover will be held back until the next meetings in August 2023, as Richard was not able to attend SA4#124 in May.\n(Footnote: WG RAN1 didn’t win an award in 2019)."

        "content": "A 3GPP Working Group RAN1 veteran with over 20 years in the group has been presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award, during the RAN1#110 meeting this week.\nRobert Love has made significant contributions to RAN1 standardization notably as the editor of the LTE technical specification TS36.213 - Physical layer procedures, ensuring the production of high-quality versions from 3GPP Release 8 onwards.\nThe maintenance of TS36.213 requires a deep understanding of all the related RAN1 agreements, while necessitating considerable re-writes to them. This workload has became increasingly demanding as the standardization has evolved, particularly in terms of the number of new projects contained within - each with its own scope.\nBob’s work has exemplified what an outstanding 3GPP delegate should be. In 2013 he received the 3GPP Excellence Award – given to only four experts in the year, over the whole project.\nThis week, during the TSG RAN Working Group 1 (#110) meeting in Toulouse, he received his lifetime Achievement Award from the Current WG1 Chair - Younsun Kim.\nAll three recent past RAN1 Chairs: Younsun Kim, Wanshi Chen (Now TSG RAN Chair) and Satoshi Nagata, nominated Bob for the award, which was granted at the last 3GPP Project Coordination Group meeting – where the heads of the seven 3GPP partners and the elected leadership meet on a six monthly basis.\n“Bob Love’s contributions to 3GPP standardization, particularly in RAN1 for more than 20 years have spanned 3G, 4G and 5G. He is outstanding both as a delegate and an editor for the RAN1 specification TS36.213.” said Wanshi Chen, TSG RAN Chair.\n“Bob has always been technically oriented, polite, friendly and patient. As an editor for 36.213, probably the most involved technical specification in LTE in 3GPP, he delivered solid and quality work in a timely manner for every single LTE release.” said Younsun Kim, TSG RAN WG1 Chair.\nBob recently retired from active participation in RAN1, so this award serves as a timely mark of 3GPP’s gratitude to an exceptional 3GPP delegate and contributor to 3GPP’s success.\n"

        "content": "By Wanshi Chen, 3GPP TSG RAN Chair\nTSG RAN#95-e was a hectic and critical meeting, held electronically from March 17th to March 23rd, with 5 working days spread across two weeks and a 48-hour quiet period imposed during the weekend.\nBesides the usual Plenary business of RAN WG issues, ITU related issues, meeting planning, etc., RAN#95-e notched up some major achievements:\n\nThe successful functional freeze for RAN Rel-17,\nApproval of RAN4-led Rel-18 package,\n\nNote: RAN1/2/3-led Rel-18 package was approved in December during RAN#94-e.\n\n\nSuccessful completion of the 5Gi merger (from RAN perspective), and\nEndorsed RAN meeting planning for 2022\n\nWhat follows is a detailed RAN#95-e summary of the key areas covered by the meeting.\nAdministrative Aspects\nRAN#95-e addressed the following administrative aspects:\nInclusive language: In 3GPP, using inclusive language for specifications is taken seriously. A large amount of effort was spent in previous RAN plenary meetings. Such effort continued in RAN#95-e, resulting in the approval of a set of Rel-17 CRs, including RP-220313 on the removal of the \"black List\" term and those derived from that term (CR to TS 44.318), RP-220314 to change “white list” to ‘allowed list’ (CR to TS 45.008), RP-220238 to take out “master, slave” (CRs for NR from RAN3), RP-220239 to change “black cells” to “excluded cells” (CR for E-UTRAN from RAN3), and RP-220506 for a variety of those terms (CRs for E-UTRAN and NR from RAN2). The detailed email discussion summary can be found in RP-220878.\nWID names and acronyms: In response to ETSI MCC contribution RP-220065 titled “Guidelines on WIDs names and acronyms”, RAN#95-e discussed and endorsed feedback as summarized in RP-220882. RAN plans to work with the guidelines, taking into account several aspects summarized in Section 5 of RP-220882.\nUTRAN Specs in Rel-17: One involved discussion in RAN#95-e was whether and how to automatically upgrade UTRAN specs (25 and some 34 specification series) from Rel-16 to Rel-17. After lengthy discussion, RAN#95-e concluded the following (see more details in RP-220906):\n\n25 series : Do not upgrade any 25-series specifications to Rel-17.\n34 series : Do not upgrade RAN4 specs TS 34.124 & 34.926, and RAN2 spec TS 34.109.\n\nHowever, since such an issue requires coordination across TSGs, a Liaison Statement (LS) was sent to TSG SA and TSG CT (see RP-221015). The LS was carefully discussed in a subsequent joint TSG session, which resulted in the following conclusion:\n\nAll 25 and 34 series specs should be upgraded to Rel-17 and that until the end of Rel-18 there should be a cross-TSG effort to find out if and how the related functionality could not be upgraded to Rel-18. This discussion should also be on whether to update the 2G specifications.\n\nRAN Meeting Planning\nSince the start of the pandemic in early 2020, 3GPP meetings have been completely converted into electronic ones.\nRecently, a decision was made by the 3GPP’s specially convened meeting hosting decision group to host TSG#96 as a face-to-face (F2F) meeting. Decisions for other potential F2F meetings in 2022 are still pending.\nFor RAN, it is necessary to plan the RAN plenary and its WG meetings by considering the output from the decision group, while having a back-up plan in case of changes. The endorsed RAN meeting planning shown in the figure below reflects the target plan and the back-up plan, and also the need for a series of inactive periods during the meeting schedule, to attempt to ensure a better work/life balance for everyone."
